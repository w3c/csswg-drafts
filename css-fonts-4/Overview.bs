<p class="advisement"><strong>This document contains ideas and
experiments that may or may not end up in the final version of a CSS
Fonts specification. Implementors are encouraged to ask about the status
of a particular feature listed here on the <code>www-style</code>
mailing list.</strong></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The CSS3 Fonts specification ([[!CSS-FONTS-3]]) describes the basic
controls CSS provides for selecting and using fonts within documents.
The ideas here are additions or modifications to the properties and
rules defined in CSS3 Fonts.</p>

	Issue: Please note that OpenType/TrueType variable font support
	is still in intial stages of specification and implementation. Please
	comment on any bugs in this spec at <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues">
	https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues</a>. Also, please note that this
	spec is incomplete and only includes some of the text from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/">
	https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/</a>.

<p></p>

<h2 id="basic-font-props">Basic Font Properties</h2>

<p>The particular font face used to render a character is determined by
the font family and other font properties that apply to a given element.
 This structure allows settings to be varied independent of each
other.</p>

<h3 id="font-family-prop">Font family: the 'font-family' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-family
	Value: [ <<family-name>> | <<generic-family>> ] #
	Initial: depends on user agent
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: n/a
	Computed value: as specified
	Media: visual
	Animatable: no
	</pre>

	This property specifies a prioritized list of font family names or
	generic family names.  A font family defines a set of faces that vary
	in weight, width or slope.  CSS uses the combination of a family name
	with other style attributes to select an individual face.  Using this
	selection mechanism, rather than selecting a face via the style name
	as is often done in design applications, allows some degree of
	regularity in textual display when fallback occurs.

	Note: Designers should note that the CSS definition of font
	attributes used for selection are explicitly not intended to define a
	font taxonomy.  A type designer's idea of a family may often extend to
	a set of faces that vary along axes other than just the standard axes
	of weight, width and slope.  A family may extend to include both a set
	of serif faces and a set of sans-serif faces or vary along axes that
	are unique to that family. The CSS font selection mechanism merely
	provides a way to determine the &ldquo;closest&rdquo; substitute when
	substitution is necessary.

	Unlike other CSS properties, component values are a comma-separated
	list indicating alternatives.  A user agent iterates through the list
	of family names until it matches an available font that contains a
	glyph for the character to be rendered.  This allows for differences
	in available fonts across platforms and for differences in the range
	of characters supported by individual fonts.

	A font family name only specifies a name given to a set of font
	faces, it does not specify an individual face.  For example, given the availability
	of the fonts below, Futura would match but Futura Medium would not:

	<div class="figure"><img alt="family and face names" src="familyvsfacename.png" /><p class="caption">Family and individual face names</p></div>

	Consider the example below:

	<div class="example">
	<pre>body {
		font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;
	}</pre>

	<p>If Helvetica is available it will be used when rendering.  If
	neither Helvetica nor Verdana is present, then the user-agent-defined
	sans serif font will be used.</p>
	</div>

	There are two types of font family names:

	<dl>
	  <dt><dfn id="family-name-value"><var>&lt;family-name&gt;</var></dfn></dt>
	  <dd>The name of a font family of choice such as Helvetica or Verdana in the previous example.
	  </dd>
	  <dt><dfn id="generic-family-value"><var>&lt;generic-family&gt;</var></dfn></dt>
	  <dd>
	    The following generic family keywords are defined: 'serif', 'sans-serif', 'cursive',
	    'fantasy', and 'monospace'. These keywords can be used as a general fallback mechanism
	    when an author's desired font choices are not available.  As keywords, they must not
	    be quoted. Authors are encouraged to append a generic font family as a last alternative for
	    improved robustness.
	  </dd>
	</dl>

	Font family names other than generic families must either be given quoted as <a
	href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#strings">strings,</a>
	or unquoted as a sequence of one or more
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier">identifiers.</a>
	This means most punctuation characters and digits at the start of
	each token must be escaped in unquoted font family names.

	To illustrate this, the following declarations are invalid:

	<pre>
	font-family: Red/Black, sans-serif;
	font-family: "Lucida" Grande, sans-serif;
	font-family: Ahem!, sans-serif;
	font-family: test@foo, sans-serif;
	font-family: #POUND, sans-serif;
	font-family: Hawaii 5-0, sans-serif;
	</pre>

	If a sequence of identifiers is given as a font family name,
	the computed value is the name converted to a string by joining
	all the identifiers in the sequence by single spaces.

	To avoid mistakes in escaping, it is recommended to quote font
	family names that contain white space, digits, or punctuation
	characters other than hyphens:

	<pre>
	body { font-family: "New Century Schoolbook", serif }

	&lt;BODY STYLE="font-family: '21st Century', fantasy">
	</pre>

	Font family <em>names</em> that happen to be the same as  keyword
	value ('inherit', 'serif', etc.) must be quoted to prevent confusion
	with the keywords with the same names. UAs must not consider these
	keywords as matching the <var>&lt;family-name&gt;</var> type. This
	applies to any keyword across all of CSS.

	The precise way a set of fonts are grouped into font families
	varies depending upon the platform font management API's.  The
	Windows GDI API only allows four faces to be grouped into a family
	while the DirectWrite API, Core Text API, and other platforms support
	font families with a variety of weights, widths and slopes (see <a
	href="#platform-props-to-css">Appendix A</a> for more details).</p>

	Some font formats allow fonts to carry multiple localizations
	of the family name. User agents must recognize and correctly
	match all of these names independent of the underlying platform
	localization, system API used or document encoding:


	<div class="figure"><img alt="examples of localized family names" src="localizedfamilynames.png" /><p class="caption">Localized family names</p></div>

	The details of localized font family name matching and the
	corresponding issues of case sensitivity are described below in the
	<a href="#font-family-casing">font matching</a> section.

	<h4 id="generic-font-families">Generic font families</h4>

	All five generic font families are defined to exist in all CSS
	implementations (they need not necessarily map to five distinct actual
	fonts). User agents should provide reasonable default choices for the
	generic font families, which express the characteristics of each family
	as well as possible within the limits allowed by the underlying
	technology. User agents are encouraged to allow users to select
	alternative choices for the generic fonts.

	<h5 class="no-num no-toc"> <span class="index-def" title="serif, definition of"><a name="serif-def"><dfn>serif</dfn></a></span></h5>

	Serif fonts represent the formal text style for a script.
	This often means but is not limited to glyphs that have finishing
	strokes, flared or tapering ends, or have actual serifed endings
	(including slab serifs). Serif fonts are typically
	proportionately-spaced. They often display a greater variation between
	thick and thin strokes than fonts from the 'sans-serif' generic font
	family. CSS uses the term 'serif' to apply to a font for any script,
	although other names may be more familiar for particular scripts, such
	as Mincho (Japanese), Sung or Song (Chinese), Batang (Korean).
	For Arabic, the Naskh style would correspond to 'serif' more due to
	its typographic role rather than its actual design style.
	Any font that is so described may be used to represent the
	generic 'serif' family.

	<div class="figure"><img alt="sample serif fonts" src="serifexamples.png" /><p class="caption">Sample serif fonts</p></div>

	<h5 class="no-num no-toc"> <span class="index-def" title="sans-serif, definition of">
	<a name="sans-serif-def"><dfn>sans-serif</dfn></a></span></h5>

	Glyphs in sans-serif fonts, as the term is used in CSS, are generally
	low contrast (vertical and horizontal stems have the close to the same
	thickness) and have stroke
	endings that are plain -- without any flaring, cross stroke, or other
	ornamentation. Sans-serif fonts are typically
	proportionately-spaced. They often have little variation between thick
	and thin strokes, compared to fonts from the 'serif' family. CSS uses
	the term 'sans-serif' to apply to a font for any script, although
	other names may be more familiar for particular scripts, such as
	Gothic (Japanese), Hei (Chinese), or Gulim (Korean). Any font that
	is so described may be used to represent the generic 'sans-serif'
	family.

	<div class="figure"><img alt="sample sans-serif fonts" src="sansserifexamples.png" /><p class="caption">Sample sans-serif fonts</p></div>

	<h5 class="no-num no-toc"> <span class="index-def" title="cursive, definition of">
	<a name="cursive-def"><dfn>cursive</dfn></a></span></h5>

	Glyphs in cursive fonts generally use a more informal script style,
	and the result looks more like handwritten pen or brush writing than
	printed letterwork. CSS uses the term 'cursive' to apply to a font for
	any script, although other names such as Chancery, Brush, Swing and
	Script are also used in font names.

	<div class="figure"><img alt="sample cursive fonts" src="cursiveexamples.png" /><p class="caption">Sample cursive fonts</p></div>

	<h5 class="no-num no-toc"> <span class="index-def" title="fantasy, definition of">
	<a name="fantasy-def"><dfn>fantasy</dfn></a></span></h5>

	Fantasy fonts are primarily decorative or expressive fonts that contain decorative or
	expressive representations of characters.
	These do not include Pi or Picture fonts which do not represent actual characters.

	<div class="figure"><img alt="sample fantasy fonts" src="fantasyexamples.png" /><p class="caption">Sample fantasy fonts</p></div>

	<h5 class="no-num no-toc"> <span class="index-def" title="monospace, definition of">
	<a name="monospace-def"><dfn>monospace</dfn></a></span></h5>

	The sole criterion of a monospace font is that all glyphs have the same fixed width.  This is often used
	to render samples of computer code.

	<div class="figure"><img alt="sample monospace fonts" src="monospaceexamples.png" /><p class="caption">Sample monospace fonts</p></div>

	<h5 class="no-num no-toc"> <span class="index-def" title="system-ui, definition of">
	<a name="system-ui-def"><dfn>system-ui</dfn></a></span></h5>

	This generic font family is intended to let text render with the default user interface font on the platform on which the UA is running. A cross-platform UA should use different fonts on its different supported platforms. The purpose of 'system-ui' is to allow web content to integrate with the look and feel of a native app. On platforms which have a collection of system user interface fonts (e.g. for different languages), user agents may treat 'system-ui' as a virtual font which encompasses all the platform user interface fonts. However, if this is done, the details of the virtual font must not be visible or detectable.

	<div class="example">
	<pre>
	&lt;div id="system-text" style="font-family: system-ui"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	...
	window.getComputedStyle(document.getElementById("system-text")).getPropertyValue("font-family");
	</pre>
	The script above should not have any knowledge if 'system-ui' is expanded to include a collection of system user interface fonts. In particular, the above script should yield a result of "system-ui" on every platform.
	</div>

	per <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Aug/0051.html">discussion</a>.

	<h5 class="no-num no-toc"> <span class="index-def" title="emoji, definition of">
	<a name="emoji-def"><dfn>emoji</dfn></a></span></h5>

	This font family is intended for use with emoji characters.

	<h5 class="no-num no-toc"> <span class="index-def" title="math, definition of">
	<a name="math-def"><dfn>math</dfn></a></span></h5>

	This font family is intended for use with mathematical expressions.

	<h5 class="no-num no-toc"> <span class="index-def" title="fangsong, definition of">
	<a name="math-def"><dfn>fangsong</dfn></a></span></h5>

	This font family is used for fang song typefaces in Chinese.

<h3 id="font-weight-prop">Font weight: the 'font-weight' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-weight
	Value: normal | bold | bolder | lighter | <<number>>
	Initial: normal
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: n/a
	Computed value: numeric weight value (see description)
	Media: visual
	</pre>

	The 'font-weight' property specifies the weight of glyphs in the font, their degree of blackness or stroke thickness.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=font-weight dfn-type=value>
		<dt id="font-weight-numeric-values"><dfn><<number>></dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			These values form an ordered sequence, where each number indicates a weight that is
at least as dark as its predecessor. Only values between 1 - 999 are valid, and all other values are treated as parse errors. Certain numeric values correspond to the commonly used weight names below (Note that a font may internally provide its own mappings, but those mappings within the font are disregarded):

			<ul>
			<li>100 - Thin</li>
			<li>200 - Extra Light (Ultra Light)</li>
			<li>300 - Light</li>
			<li>400 - Normal</li>
			<li>500 - Medium</li>
			<li>600 - Semi Bold (Demi Bold)</li>
			<li>700 - Bold</li>
			<li>800 - Extra Bold (Ultra Bold)</li>
			<li>900 - Black (Heavy)</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>normal</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Same as '400'.
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>bold</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Same as '700'.
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>bolder</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies a bolder weight than the inherited value.
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>lighter</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies a lighter weight than the inherited value.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	Font formats that use a scale other than a nine-step scale should map
	their scale onto the CSS scale so that 400 roughly corresponds with a
	face that would be labeled as Regular, Book, Roman and 700 roughly
	matches a face that would be labeled as Bold. Or weights may be
	inferred from the style names, ones that correspond roughly with the
	scale above. The scale is relative, so a face with a larger weight value
	must never appear lighter. If style names are used to infer weights,
	care should be taken to handle variations in style names across locales.

	Quite often there are only a few weights available for a particular
	font family. When a weight is specified for which no face exists, a
	face with a nearby weight is used. In general, bold weights map to faces
	with heavier weights and light weights map to faces with lighter weights
	(see the <a href="#font-matching-algorithm">font matching section
	below</a> for a precise definition). The examples here illustrate which
	face is used for different weights, grey indicates a face for that
	weight does not exist so a face with a nearby weight is used:

	<div class="figure"><img alt="weight mappings for a family with 400, 700 and 900 weights" src="optimaweights.png" /><p class="caption">Weight mappings for a font family with 400, 700 and 900 weight faces</p></div>

	<div class="figure"><img alt="weight mappings for a family with 300, 600 weights" src="hiraginoweights.png" /><p class="caption">Weight mappings for a font family with 300 and 600 weight faces</p></div>

	Most user agents model a font as having a particular weight which often corresponds to one of the numbers in the nine-step scale mentioned <a href="#font-weight-numeric-values">above</a>.
	While this is true of most fonts, some fonts may be configurable so as to
	support a range of weights. In this situation, the user agent uses a face
	with a weight as close as possible to the weight requested (see the
	<a href="#font-matching-algorithm">font matching section below</a> for the
	precise algorithm). In particular, a user agent using a font which supports
	a range of weights should behave the same as if a font is present at each
	individual weight in the range. For TrueType / OpenType fonts which use variations, the "wght"
	variation is used to implement varying weights. Fractional weights are
	valid.

	Although the practice is not well-loved by typographers, bold faces are often
	synthesized by user agents for faces that lack actual bold faces. For
	the purposes of style matching, these faces must be treated as if they
	exist within the family. Authors can explicitly avoid this behavior
	by using the 'font-synthesis' property.

	Specified values of 'bolder' and 'lighter' indicate weights
	relative to the weight of the parent element.  The computed weight is
	calculated based on the inherited 'font-weight' value using the chart
	below.

	<table id="bolderlighter" class="data" summary="Bolder/lighter mappings">
	<thead>
	<tr>
	  <th>Inherited value</th>
	  <th>bolder</th>
	  <th>lighter</th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr><th>- 99</th><td>400</td><td>No change</td></tr>
	<tr><th>100 - 349</th><td>400</td><td>100</td></tr>
	<tr><th>350 - 549</th><td>700</td><td>100</td></tr>
	<tr><th>550 - 749</th><td>900</td><td>400</td></tr>
	<tr><th>750 - 899</th><td>900</td><td>700</td></tr>
	<tr><th>900 -</th><td>No change</td><td>700</td></tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>

	The table above is equivalent to selecting the next relative bolder or lighter face,
	given a font family containing normal and bold faces along with a thin and a heavy face.
	Authors who desire finer control over the exact weight values used for a given element
	may use numerical values instead of relative weights.

<h3 id="font-stretch-prop">Font width: the 'font-stretch' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-stretch
	Value: normal | ultra-condensed | extra-condensed | condensed | semi-condensed | semi-expanded | expanded | extra-expanded | ultra-expanded | <<percentage>>
	Initial: normal
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: Not resolved.
	Computed value: numeric weight value (see description)
	Media: visual
	Animatable: As <<number>>
	</pre>

	The 'font-stretch' property selects a normal,
	condensed, or expanded face from a font family. Absolute keyword values are aliased to
	have the following meaning (Note that a font may internally provide its own mappings, but those mappings within the font are disregarded):

	<table id="stretchmappings" class="data" summary="font-stretch numeric mappings">
	<thead>
	<tr>
	  <th>Absolute keyword value</th>
	  <th>Numeric value</th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr><th>ultra-condensed</th><th>50%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>extra-condensed</th><th>62.5%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>condensed</th><th>75%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>semi-condensed</th><th>87.5%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>normal</th><th>100%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>semi-expanded</th><th>112.5%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>expanded</th><th>125%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>extra-expanded</th><th>150%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>ultra-expanded</th><th>200%</th></tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>

	Negative values are not allowed and are treated as parse errors.
	When a face does not exist
	for a given width, values less than 100% map to a narrower face,
	otherwise a wider face. Conversely, values greater than or equal to 100% map to a wider
	face, otherwise a narrower face. Some fonts may support a range of stretch
	values; if the requested stretch value is not available in the font, the
	closest supported value should be used, using the same mapping rules (see the
	<a href="#font-matching-algorithm">font matching section below</a> for the
	precise algorithm). For TrueType / OpenType fonts which use variations, the "wdth"
	variation is used to implement varying widths. The figure below shows how nine
	font-stretch property settings affect font matching for font family
	containing a variety of discrete widths. Grey indicates a width for which no
	face exists and a different width is substituted:

	<div class="figure"><img alt="width mappings for a family with condensed, normal and expanded faces" src="universwidths.png" /><p class="caption">Width mappings for a font family with condensed, normal and expanded width faces</p></div>

	User Agents must not sythesize stretched faces for font families which lack actual stretched faces.

<h3 id="font-style-prop">Font style: the 'font-style' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-style
	Value: normal | italic | oblique <<angle>>?
	Initial: normal
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: n/a
	Computed value: As specified
	Media: visual
	Animatable: If both "from" and "to" values are "oblique", then yes, as an <<angle>>. Otherwise, no.
	</pre>

	The 'font-style' property allows
	italic or oblique faces to be selected. Italic forms are generally cursive in nature while oblique faces are
	typically sloped versions of the regular face.  Oblique faces can be simulated by artificially sloping the
	glyphs of the regular face. Compare the artificially sloped renderings of Palatino "a" and Baskerville "N"
	in grey with the actual italic versions:

	<div class="figure"><img alt="artificial sloping vs. real italics" src="realvsfakeitalics.png" /><p class="caption">Artificial sloping versus real italics</p></div>

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=font-style dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>normal</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Matches against a face that is classified as a normal face, one that is neither italic or obliqued. This represents an oblique value of "0".
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>italic</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Matches against a font that is labeled as an oblique face, or an italic face if one is not.
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>oblique <<angle>>?</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Controls matching against an oblique face. The lack of a number represents an angle of "20deg". Values less than or equal to -90deg or values greater than or equal to 90deg are invalid and are treated as parse errors. (Note that a font may internally provide its own mapping for "oblique", but that mapping within the font is disregarded)
		</dd>
	</dl>

	Some font families may contain only zero or one italic or oblique face, while yet other
	families may contain multiple oblique faces with varying
	angles. The font matching routine will select a font to use which
	is closest to the requested angle. In general, for a requested angle greater
	or equal to 20deg, larger angles are prefered; otherwise, smaller
	angles are preferred (see the
	<a href="#font-matching-algorithm">font matching section below</a> for
	the precise algorithm). Fractional and negative values are accepted, but values
	less than or equal to -90 as well as values greater than or equal to 90 are not
	allowed and are treated as parse errors.
	For TrueType / OpenType fonts which use variations, the "slnt"
	variation is used to implement oblique values, and the "ital" variation with a value of "1"
	is used to implement the italic values. The meaning of a
	negative value for "oblique" is to slope the text in the opposite
	direction.

	If no italic or oblique face is available, oblique faces can be
	synthesized by rendering non-obliqued faces with an artificial
	obliquing operation. The use of these artificially obliqued faces
	can be disabled using the 'font-synthesis' property. The details
	of the obliquing operation are not explicitly defined.

	For the purposes of font matching, User Agents may treat 'italic' as a synonym for
	'obique'. For User Agents which treat these values distinctly, synthesis must not
	be performed for 'italic'. All user agents may perform synthesis for 'oblique'.

	<p class="note">Authors should also be aware that synthesized
	approaches may not be suitable for scripts like Cyrillic, where italic
	forms are very different in shape.  It is always better to use an actual
	italic font rather than rely on a synthetic version.</p>

	<!-- resolution on the "undefined" nature of synthetics: https://www.w3.org/2013/06/06-css-minutes.html#item03 -->

	Many scripts lack the tradition of mixing a cursive form within
	text rendered with a normal face.  Chinese, Japanese and Korean fonts
	almost always lack italic or oblique faces.  Fonts that support a
	mixture of scripts will sometimes omit specific scripts such as Arabic
	from the set of glyphs supported in the italic face. User agents
	should be careful about making <em>character map</em> assumptions across
	faces when implementing support for <em>installed font fallback</em>.

<h3 id="font-size-prop">Font size: the 'font-size' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-size
	Value: <<absolute-size>> | <<relative-size>> | <<length-percentage>>
	Initial: medium
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: refer to parent element's font size
	Computed value: absolute length
	Media: visual
	Animatable: As <<length>>
	</pre>

    This property indicates the desired height of glyphs from the
    font. For scalable fonts, the font-size is a scale factor applied to the EM unit
    of the font. (Note that certain glyphs may bleed outside their EM box.) For
    non-scalable fonts, the font-size is converted into absolute units and matched
    against the declared font-size of the font, using the same absolute coordinate
    space for both of the matched values.
    Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=font-size dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn><<absolute-size>></dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			An <<absolute-size>> keyword refers to an entry

			are:

			[ xx-small | x-small | small | medium | large | x-large | xx-large ]
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn><<relative-size>></dfn></dt>
		<dd>
    		A <<relative-size>> keyword is interpreted
    		relative to the table of font sizes and the computed 'font-size' of the
    		parent element. Possible values are:

    		[ larger | smaller ]

    		For example, if the parent element has a font size of
    		'medium', a value of 'larger' will make the font size of the
    		current element be 'large'.  If the parent element's size is not
    		close to a table entry, the user agent is free to interpolate
    		between table entries or round off to the closest one. The user
    		agent may have to extrapolate table values if the numerical value
    		goes beyond the keywords.
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn><<length-percentage>></dfn></dt>
		<dd>
    		A length value specifies an absolute font size
        	(independent of the user agent's font table).
        	Negative lengths are invalid.

			A percentage value specifies an absolute font size relative
        	to the parent element's font size. Use of percentage values, or
        	values in 'em's, leads to more robust and cascadable style sheets.
      		Negative percentages are invalid.

	The following table provides user agent guidelines for the
	absolute-size scaling factor and their mapping to HTML heading and
	absolute font-sizes. The 'medium' value is used as the reference
	middle value. The user agent may fine-tune these values for different
	fonts or different types of display devices.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note 1.</strong> To preserve readability, an UA applying
	these guidelines should nevertheless avoid creating font-size resulting
	in less than 9 device pixels per EM unit on a computer display.</p>

	<p class="note"><strong>Note 2.</strong> In CSS1, the suggested
	scaling factor between adjacent indexes was 1.5 which user experience
	proved to be too large. In CSS2, the suggested scaling factor for computer
	screen between adjacent indexes was 1.2 which still created issues for the small
	sizes. The new scaling factor varies between each index to provide a better
	readability.</p>

	The actual value of this property may differ from the computed
	value due a numerical value on 'font-size-adjust' and the
	unavailability of certain font sizes.

	Child elements inherit the computed 'font-size' value (otherwise, the
	effect of 'font-size-adjust' would compound).

	<div class="example">
	<pre>
	p { font-size: 12pt; }
	blockquote { font-size: larger }
	em { font-size: 150% }
	em { font-size: 1.5em }

<h3 id="font-min-max-size-prop">Minimum and maximum font size: the 'font-min-size' and 'font-max-size' properties</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">

	Value: <<absolute-size>> | <<relative-size>> | <<length-percentage>>
	Initial: 0px
	Applies to: all elements

	Computed value: absolute length
	Media: visual
	Animatable: As <<length>>
	</pre>

	These two properties allow a website or user to require an element's font size to be clamped within the range
	supplied with these two properties. If the computed value 'font-size' is outside the bounds created by 'font-min-size'
	and 'font-max-size', the use value of 'font-size' is clamped to the values specified in these two properties.

	Some user agents provide a nonstandard mapping between the computed value of 'font-size' and the used value of 'font-size'.
	The interaction of those nonstandard algorithms with 'font-min-size' or 'font-max-size' is explicitly undefined.

	If the 'font-min-size' property is computed to be larger than the 'font-max-size' property, then the two properties are ignored.

	Users with accessibility preferences may set this in a user-agent style sheet to force websites' text to become larger.

	These two properties have no effect on the computed value of 'font-size'.

<h3 id="font-size-adjust-prop">Relative sizing: the 'font-size-adjust' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-size-adjust
	Value: none | <<number>>
	Initial: none

	</pre>

	For any given font size, the apparent size and legibility of text
	varies across fonts. For scripts such as Latin or Cyrillic that
	distinguish between upper and lowercase letters, the relative height
	of lowercase letters compared to their uppercase counterparts is a
	determining factor of legibility. This is commonly referred to as the
	<span class="index-def" title="aspect value"><dfn>aspect value</dfn></span>.
	Precisely defined, it is equal to the x-height of a font divided by
	the font size.

	In situations where font fallback occurs, fallback fonts may not
	share the same aspect value as the desired font family and will thus
	appear less readable.  The 'font-size-adjust' property is a way to
	preserve the readability of text when font fallback occurs.  It does
	this by adjusting the font-size so that the x-height is the same
	regardless of the font used.

	<div class="example">

	The style defined below defines Verdana as the desired font family, but if Verdana is not available Futura or Times
	will be used.

	<pre>p {
	    font-family: Verdana, Futura, Times;
	}

	&lt;p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ...&lt;/p>
	</pre>

	Verdana has a relatively high aspect value, lowercase letters are relatively tall compared to uppercase
	letters, so at small sizes text appears legible.  Times has a lower aspect value and so if fallback occurs,
	the text will be less legible at small sizes than Verdana.
	</div>

	How text rendered in each of these fonts compares is shown below, the columns show text rendered in Verdana, Futura and Times.
	The same font-size value is used across cells
	within each row and red lines are included to show the differences in x-height.  In the upper half each row is rendered in the same font-size value.  The same is true
	for the lower half but in this half the 'font-size-adjust' property is also set so that the actual font size is adjusted
	to preserve the x-height across each row.  Note how small text remains relatively legible across each row in the lower half.

	<div class="figure"><img alt="text with and without 'font-size-adjust'" src="fontsizeadjust.png" /><p class="caption">Text with and without the use of 'font-size-adjust'</p></div>

	This property allows authors to specify an <i>aspect value</i> for an element that
	will effectively preserve the x-height of the first choice font, whether it is substituted
	or not. Values have the following meanings:

	<dl>
	<dt><dfn id="font-size-adjust-none-value" title="none!!font-size-adjust">none</dfn>
	<dd>Do not preserve the font's x-height.

	<dt><dfn id="aspect-ratio-value"><var>&lt;number&gt;</var></dfn>

	<dd>Specifies the <i>aspect value</i> used in the calculation below to calculate the adjusted
	font size:

	<pre>c  =  ( a / a' ) s
	</pre>

	where:

	<pre>s  =  font-size value
	a  =  <i>aspect value</i> as specified by the 'font-size-adjust' property
	a' =  <i>aspect value</i> of actual font
	c  =  adjusted font-size to use
	</pre>

	Negative values are invalid.

	This value applies to any font that is selected but in typical usage it should be based
	on the <i>aspect value</i> of the first font in the font-family list.  If this is specified accurately,
	the <tt>(a/a')</tt> term in the formula above is effectively 1 for the first font and no adjustment occurs.
	If the value is specified inaccurately, text rendered using the first font in the family
	list will display differently in older user agents that don't support 'font-size-adjust'.
	</dl>

	The value of 'font-size-adjust' affects the used value of 'font-size' but
	does not affect the computed value.  It affects the size of relative units
	that are based on font metrics of the <i>first available font</i> such
	as <code>ex</code> and <code>ch</code> but does not affect the size of
	<code>em</code> units.  Since numeric values of
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-line-height">'line-height'</a>
	refer to the computed size of 'font-size', 'font-size-adjust' does not affect the used value of
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-line-height">'line-height'</a>.

	Note: In CSS, authors often specify
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-line-height">'line-height'</a>
	as a multiple of the 'font-size'.  Since the 'font-size-adjust'
	property affects the used value of 'font-size', authors should take
	care setting the line height when 'font-size-adjust' is used. Setting
	the line height too tightly can result in overlapping lines of text
	in this situation.

	Authors can calculate the
	<i>aspect value</i> for a given font by comparing spans with the same content but
	different 'font-size-adjust' properties.  If the same font-size is used, the spans will match when the 'font-size-adjust'
	value is accurate for the given font.

	<div class="example">

	Two spans with borders are used to determine the <i>aspect value</i> of a font.  The 'font-size' is the same for both spans but the
	'font-size-adjust' property is specified only for the right span.  Starting with a value of 0.5, the aspect
	value can be adjusted until the borders around the two letters line up.

	<pre>p {
	    font-family: Futura;
	    font-size: 500px;
	}

	span {
	    border: solid 1px red;
	}

	.adjust {
	    font-size-adjust: 0.5;
	}

	&lt;p>&lt;span>b&lt;/span>&lt;span class="adjust">b&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
	</pre>
	<div class="figure"><img alt="Futura with an <i>aspect value</i> of 0.5" src="beforefontsizeadjust.png" /><p class="caption">Futura with an <i>aspect value</i> of 0.5</p></div>

	The box on the right is a bit bigger than the one on the left, so the <i>aspect value</i> of this font is something less than 0.5.
	Adjust the value until the boxes align.
	</div>

<h3 id="font-prop">Shorthand font property: the 'font' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font
	Value: [ [ 'font-style' || 'font-variant-css21' || 'font-weight' || 'font-stretch-css3' ]? 'font-size' [ / 'line-height' ]? 'font-family' ] | caption | icon | menu | message-box | small-caption | status-bar
	Initial: see individual properties
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: see individual properties
	Computed value: see individual properties
	Media: visual
	Animatable: see individual properties
	</pre>

	The 'font' property is, except as
	described below, a shorthand property for setting 'font-style', 'font-variant', 'font-weight', 'font-stretch', 'font-size', 'line-height',
	'font-family' at the same place in the stylesheet. Values for the 'font-variant' property may also be included but only those supported in
	CSS 2.1, none of the 'font-variant' values added in this specification can be used in the 'font' shorthand:

	<pre class="prod"><dfn id="font-variant-css21-values"><var>&lt;font-variant-css21&gt;</var></dfn> = [normal | small-caps]</pre>

	Values for the 'font-stretch' property may also be included but only those supported in
	CSS Fonts level 3, none of the 'font-stretch' values added in this specification can be used in the 'font' shorthand:

	<pre class="prod"><dfn id="font-stretch-css3-values"><var>&lt;font-stretch-css3&gt;</var></dfn> = [normal | ultra-condensed | extra-condensed | condensed | semi-condensed | semi-expanded | expanded | extra-expanded | ultra-expanded]</pre>

	The syntax of this property is based on a traditional typographical
	shorthand notation to set multiple properties related to fonts.

	All subproperties of the 'font' property are first reset to their initial values,
	including those listed above plus 'font-size-adjust', 'font-kerning', subproperties of 'font-variant' and
	and 'font-language-override'.
	Then, those properties that are given explicit values in the <span class="property">'font'</span>
	shorthand are set to those values. For a definition of allowed and
	initial values, see the previously defined properties. For reasons of
	backwards compatibility, it is not possible to set 'font-size-adjust'
	to anything other than its initial value using the 'font'
	shorthand property; instead, use the individual property.

	<div class="example">

	<pre>p { font: 12pt/14pt sans-serif }
	p { font: 80% sans-serif }
	p { font: x-large/110% &quot;new century schoolbook&quot;, serif }
	p { font: bold italic large Palatino, serif }
	p { font: normal small-caps 120%/120% fantasy }
	p { font: condensed oblique 12pt &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, serif; }
	p { font: condensed oblique 25deg 753 12pt &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, serif; }
	</pre>

	In the second rule, the font size percentage value ("80%") refers
	to the computed 'font-size' of the parent element. In the third rule, the line
	height percentage ("110%") refers to the font size of the element
	itself.

	The first three rules do not specify the 'font-variant' and 'font-weight' explicitly, so these properties
	receive their initial values ('normal'). Notice that the font family
	name "new century schoolbook", which contains spaces, is enclosed in
	quotes. The fourth rule sets the 'font-weight' to 'bold', the 'font-style' to 'italic', and implicitly sets
	'font-variant' to 'normal'.

	The fifth rule sets the 'font-variant' ('small-caps'), the 'font-size' (120% of the
	parent's font size), the 'line-height' (120% of the font size) and the 'font-family'
	('fantasy'). It follows that the keyword 'normal' applies to the two
	remaining properties: 'font-style' and 'font-weight'.

	The sixth rule sets the 'font-style', 'font-stretch', 'font-size', and 'font-family', the other font
	properties being set to their initial values.

	The seventh rule sets 'font-style' to "oblique 25deg", 'font-weight' to "753", and 'font-stretch' to "condensed".
	Note that the "25deg" in this rule must be immediately following the "oblique" keyword.
	</div>

	Since the 'font-stretch' property was not defined in CSS 2.1, when using 'font-stretch'
	values within 'font' rules, authors should include a extra version compatible with
	older user agents:

	<pre>p {
	  font: 80% sans-serif;   /* for older user agents */
	  font: condensed 80% sans-serif;
	}</pre>

	The following values refer to system fonts:

	<dl>
	<dt><strong>caption</strong>
	<dd>The font used for captioned controls (e.g., buttons, drop-downs, etc.).
	<dt><strong>icon</strong>
	<dd>The font used to label icons.
	<dt><strong>menu</strong>
	<dd>The font used in menus (e.g., dropdown menus and menu lists).
	<dt><strong>message-box</strong>
	<dd>The font used in dialog boxes.
	<dt><strong>small-caption</strong>
	<dd>The font used for labeling small controls.
	<dt><strong>status-bar</strong>
	<dd>The font used in window status bars.
	</dl>

	System fonts may only be set as a whole; that is, the font
	family, size, weight, style, etc. are all set at the same time.
	These values may then be altered individually if desired.  If no
	font with the indicated characteristics exists on a given platform,
	the user agent should either intelligently substitute (e.g., a smaller
	version of the 'caption' font might be used for the 'small-caption'
	font), or substitute a user agent default font. As for regular fonts,
	if, for a system font, any of the individual properties are not part
	of the operating system's available user preferences, those properties
	should be set to their initial values.

	That is why this property is "almost" a shorthand property: system
	fonts can only be specified with this property, not with
	'font-family' itself, so 'font'
	allows authors to do more than the
	sum of its subproperties. However, the individual properties such as
	'font-weight' are still given values
	taken from the system font, which can be independently varied.

	Note that the keywords used for the system fonts listed above are
	only treated as keywords when they occur in the initial position, in
	other positions the same string is treated as part of the font family
	name:

	<pre>  font: menu;        /* use the font settings for system menus */
	  font: large menu;  /* use a font family named "menu" */</pre>

	<div class="example">

	<pre>button { font: 300 italic 1.3em/1.7em &quot;FB Armada&quot;, sans-serif }
	button p { font: menu }
	button p em { font-weight: bolder }
	</pre>

	If the font used for dropdown menus on a particular system
	happened to be, for example, 9-point Charcoal, with a weight of 600, then P
	elements that were descendants of BUTTON would be displayed as if
	this rule were in effect:

	<pre>button p { font: 600 9pt Charcoal }
	</pre>

	Because the 'font' shorthand resets to its initial value
	any property not explicitly given a value, this has the same effect as
	this declaration:

	<pre>button p {
	  font-style: normal;
	  font-variant: normal;
	  font-weight: 600;
	  font-size: 9pt;
	  line-height: normal;
	  font-family: Charcoal
	}
	</pre>

	</div>

<h3 id="font-size-adjust-prop">Controlling synthetic faces: the 'font-synthesis' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-synthesis
	Value: none | [ weight || style || small-caps ]
	Initial: weight style small-caps
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: as specified
	Media: visual
	Animatable: no
	</pre>

	This property controls whether user agents are allowed to synthesize bold or oblique font
	faces when a font family lacks bold or italic faces.  If 'weight' is not specified, user agents
	must not synthesize bold faces. If 'style' is not specified, user agents must not synthesize
	italic faces. If 'small-caps' is not specified, user agents must not synthesize small-caps faces
	nor all-small-caps faces.
	A value of 'none' disallows all synthetic faces.

	<div class="example">
	<p>The style rule below disables the use of synthetically obliqued Arabic:</p>
	</p>
	<pre>*:lang(ar) { font-synthesis: none; }
	</pre>
	</div>

<h2 id="font-resources">Font Resources</h2>

<h3 id="font-face-rule">The <dfn id="at-font-face-rule" style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit"><code>@font-face</code></dfn> rule</h3>

	The <code>@font-face</code> rule allows for linking to fonts that are
	automatically fetched and activated when needed. This allows authors to select
	a font that closely matches the design goals for a given page
	rather than limiting the font choice to a set of fonts available
	on a given platform. A set of font descriptors define the location of a font
	resource, either locally or externally, along with the style characteristics of
	an individual face. Multiple <code>@font-face</code> rules can be used to construct
	font families with a variety of faces. Using CSS font matching rules, a
	user agent can selectively download only those faces that are needed for
	a given piece of text.

	The <code>@font-face</code> rule consists of the <code>@font-face</code> at-keyword followed
	by a block of descriptor declarations. In terms of the grammar, this
	specification defines the following productions:

	<pre><dfn>font_face_rule</dfn>
	  : <i>FONT_FACE_SYM</i> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#scanner"><i>S</i></a>* '{' <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#scanner"><i>S</i></a>* <i>descriptor_declaration</i>? [ ';' <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#scanner"><i>S</i></a>* <i>descriptor_declaration</i>? ]* '}' <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#scanner"><i>S</i></a>*
	  ;

	<dfn>descriptor_declaration</dfn>
	  : <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#grammar"><i>property</i></a> ':' <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#scanner"><i>S</i></a>* <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#grammar"><i>expr</i></a>
	  ;</pre>

	The following new definitions are introduced:

	<pre>-    -|\\0{0,4}2d(\r\n|[ \t\r\n\f])?

	F    f|\\0{0,4}(46|66)(\r\n|[ \t\r\n\f])?</pre>

	The following new token is introduced:

	@{F}{O}{N}{T}{-}{F}{A}{C}{E} {return <dfn>FONT_FACE_SYM</dfn>;}

	Each <code>@font-face</code>
	rule specifies a value for every font descriptor, either implicitly or
	explicitly. Those not given explicit values in the rule take the initial
	value listed with each descriptor in this specification. These
	descriptors apply solely within the context of the <code>@font-face</code> rule in
	which they are defined, and do not apply to document language elements.
	There is no notion of which elements the descriptors apply to or whether
	the values are inherited by child elements.  When a given descriptor occurs
	multiple times in a given <code>@font-face</code> rule, only the last
	descriptor declaration is used and all prior declarations for that
	descriptor are ignored.

	<div class="example">

	To use a downloadable font called Gentium:

	<pre>
	@font-face {
	  font-family: Gentium;
	  src: url(http://example.com/fonts/Gentium.woff);
	}

	p { font-family: Gentium, serif; }
	</pre>

	The user agent will download Gentium and use it when rendering text
	within paragraph elements.  If for some reason the site serving the font
	is unavailable, the default serif font will be used.
	</div>

	A given set of <code>@font-face</code> rules define a set of fonts
	available for use within the documents that contain these rules.
	When font matching is done, fonts defined using these rules
	are considered before other available fonts on a system.

	Downloaded fonts are only available to documents that reference them.
	The process of activating these fonts must not make them available to
	other applications or to documents that don't directly link to the same
	font. User agent implementers might consider it convenient to use
	downloaded fonts when rendering characters in other documents for which no
	other available font exists as part of the <em>system font fallback</em> procedure.
	However, this would cause a security leak since the contents of one page would be
	able to affect other pages, something an attacker could use as an attack
	vector.  These restrictions do not affect caching behavior, fonts are
	cached the same way other web resources are cached.

	This at-rule follows the forward-compatible parsing rules of CSS.
	Like properties in a declaration block, declarations of any
	descriptors that are not supported by the user agent must be ignored.
	<code>@font-face</code> rules require a font-family and src
	descriptor; if either of these are missing, the
	<code>@font-face</code> rule is invalid and must be ignored
	entirely.

	In cases where user agents have limited platform resources or implement
	the ability to disable downloadable font resources, <code>@font-face</code> rules must
	simply be ignored; the behavior of individual descriptors as defined in this
	specification should not be altered.

<h3 id="font-family-desc">Font family: the <a href="#descdef-font-family">font-family</a> descriptor</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: font-family
	Value: <<family-name>>
	For: @font-face
	Initial: N/A
	</pre>

	This descriptor defines the font family name that will be used in
	all CSS font family name matching.  It is required for the <code>@font-face</code>
	rule to be valid. It overrides the font family names contained in the
	underlying font data. If the font family name is the same as a font
	family available in a given user's environment, it effectively hides
	the underlying font for documents that use the stylesheet.  This
	permits a web author to freely choose font-family names without
	worrying about conflicts with font family names present in a given
	user's environment. Likewise, platform substitutions for a given font
	family name must not be used.

<h3 id="src-desc">Font reference: the 'src' descriptor</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: src
	Value: [ <<url>> [ format( <<string>> # )]? | <<font-face-name>> ] #
	For: @font-face
	Initial: N/A
	</pre>

	This descriptor specifies the resource containing font data. It is
	required for the <code>@font-face</code> rule to be valid. Its value
	is a  prioritized, comma-separated list of external references or
	locally-installed font face names. When a font is needed the user
	agent iterates over the set of references listed, using the first one
	it can successfully activate. Activation of a font involves downloading
	the file or reading it from disk, parsing it, and perhaps additional user-agent-dependent steps.
	Fonts containing invalid data or local
	font faces that are not found are ignored and the user agent loads the
	next font in the list.

	As with other URLs in CSS, the URL may be relative, in which case it
	is resolved relative to the location of the style sheet containing the
	<code>@font-face</code> rule. In
	the case of SVG fonts, the URL points to an element within a document
	containing SVG font definitions.  If the element reference is omitted,
	a reference to the first defined font is implied.  Similarly, font
	container formats that can contain more than one font must load one
	and only one of the fonts for a given <code>@font-face</code> rule. Fragment
	identifiers are used to indicate which font to load.  If a container
	format lacks a defined fragment identifier scheme, implementations
	should use a simple 1-based indexing scheme (e.g. "font-collection#1"
	for the first font, "font-collection#2" for the second font).

	<pre>
	src: url(fonts/simple.woff);   /* load simple.woff relative to stylesheet location */
	src: url(/fonts/simple.woff);  /* load simple.woff from absolute location */
	src: url(fonts.svg#simple);    /* load SVG font with id 'simple' */
	</pre>

	External references consist of a URL, followed by an optional hint
	describing the format of the font resource referenced by that URL. The
	format hint contains a comma-separated list of format strings that
	denote well-known font formats. Conformant user agents must skip
	downloading a font resource if the format hints indicate only
	unsupported or unknown font formats.  If no format hints are supplied,
	the user agent should download the font resource.

	<pre>
	/* load WOFF font if possible, otherwise use OpenType font */

	Given the overlap in common usage between TrueType and OpenType, the
	format hints "truetype" and "opentype" must be considered as synonymous;
	a format hint of "opentype" does not imply that the font contains
	Postscript CFF style glyph data or that it contains OpenType layout
	information (see <a href="#platform-props-to-css">Appendix A</a> for more background on this).

	A value of "woff-variations", "truetype-variations", or "opentype-variations" imply support
	of the "woff", "truetype", or "opentype" formats respectively along with additional support for
	font variations. Web authors can specify this format to indicate that variation support is required
	for correct rendering of a font. This mechanism can be used for gracefully falling back to an
	ancillary font when variation support is not present.

	When authors would prefer to use a locally available
	copy of a given font and download it if it's not, <code>local()</code>
	can be used. The locally-installed 'font-face-name'
	argument to <code>local()</code> is a format-specific string that
	uniquely identifies a single font face within a larger family.  The
	syntax for a 'font-face-name' is a unique font face
	name enclosed by "local(" and ")".  The name can optionally be
	enclosed in quotes.  If unquoted, the unquoted font family name
	processing conventions apply; the name must be a sequence of
	identifiers separated by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-syntax/#whitespace">whitespace</a>
	which is converted to a string by joining the identifiers together
	separated by a single space.

	<pre>
	/* regular face of Gentium */
	@font-face {
	  font-family: MyGentium;
	  src: local(Gentium),    /* use locally available Gentium */
	       url(Gentium.woff); /* otherwise, download it */
	}
	</pre>

	For OpenType and TrueType fonts, this string is used to match only
	the Postscript name or the full font name in the name table of locally
	available fonts. Which type of name is used varies by platform and
	font, so authors should include both of these names to assure proper
	matching across platforms. Platform substitutions for a given font
	name must not be used.

	<pre>
	/* bold face of Gentium */
	@font-face {
	  font-family: MyGentium;
	  src: local(Gentium Bold),    /* full font name */
	       local(Gentium-Bold),    /* Postscript name */
	       url(GentiumBold.woff);  /* otherwise, download it */
	  font-weight: bold;
	}
	</pre>

	Just as a <code>@font-face</code> rule specifies the characteristics of a single font
	within a family, the unique name used with <code>local()</code> specifies a single
	font, not an entire font family. Defined in terms of
	OpenType font data, the Postscript name is found in the font's
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm">name table</a>,
	in the name record with nameID = 6 (see
	[[!OPENTYPE]] for more details).  The Postscript name is the commonly
	used key for all fonts on OSX and for Postscript CFF fonts under
	Windows. The full font name (nameID = 4) is used as a unique key for
	fonts with TrueType glyphs on Windows.

	For OpenType fonts with multiple localizations of the full font name, the US
	English version is used (language ID = 0x409 for Windows and language ID = 0 for Macintosh)
	or the first localization
	when a US English full font name is not available (the OpenType
	specification recommends that <a
	href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm">all fonts
	minimally include US English names</a>). User agents that also match
	other full font names, e.g. matching the Dutch name when the current
	system locale is set to Dutch, are considered non-conformant. This is
	done not to prefer English but to avoid matching inconsistencies across
	font versions and OS localizations, since font style names (e.g. "Bold")
	are frequently localized into many languages and the set of
	localizations available varies widely across platform and font version.
	User agents that match a concatenation of family name (nameID = 1) with
	style name (nameID = 2) are considered non-conformant.

	This also allows for referencing faces that belong to larger
	families that cannot otherwise be referenced.

	<div class="example">
		<p>Use a local font or reference an SVG font in another document:</p>
		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: Headline;
		  src: local(Futura-Medium),
		       url(fonts.svg#MyGeometricModern) format("svg");
		}
		</pre>
		<p>Create an alias for local Japanese fonts on different platforms:</p>
		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: jpgothic;

		}
		</pre>

		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: Hoefler Text Ornaments;
		  /* has the same font properties as Hoefler Text Regular */
		  src: local(HoeflerText-Ornaments);
		}
		</pre>

		<p>Since localized fullnames never match, a document with the header
		style rules below would always render using the default serif font, regardless
		whether a particular system locale parameter is set to Finnish or not:</p>
		<pre>
		@font-face {

		  src: local("Arial Lihavoitu");  /* Finnish fullname for Arial Bold, should fail */
		  font-weight: bold;
		}

		h2 { font-family: SectionHeader, serif; }
		</pre>

		<p>A conformant user agent would never load the font 'gentium.eot' in the
		example below, since it is included in the first definition of the 'src' descriptor
		which is overridden by the second definition in the same <code>@font-face</code> rule:</p>

		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: MainText;
		  src: url(gentium.eot);                     /* for use with older user agents */
		  src: local("Gentium"), url(gentium.woff);  /* Overrides src definition */
		}

	For: @font-face
	Initial: normal
	</pre>

	These descriptors define the characteristics of a font face and are
	used in the process of matching styles to specific faces. For a font
	family defined with several <code>@font-face</code> rules, user agents can either
	download all faces in the family or use these descriptors to selectively
	download font faces that match actual styles used in document. The
	meaning of the values for these descriptors are the same as those for the corresponding
	font properties except that relative keywords are not allowed, 'bolder' and
	'lighter'. If these descriptors are omitted, initial
	values are assumed. If specified values are out of range of the accepted values
	of the property of the same name, the descriptor is treated as a parse error.

	Ranges are accepted in these three descriptors in place of a single value. Where a single
	value is specified, it has the same meaning as a range with identical startpoint and
	endpoint. User agents may swap the computed value of the startpoint and endpoint of the range
	in order to forbid decreasing ranges. Both endpoints are inclusive.
	The ranges are used in the <a href="#font-matching-algorithm">Font Matching Algorithm</a> below.

	The value for these font face style attributes is used in place of
	the style implied by the underlying font data.  This allows authors to
	combine faces in flexible combinations, even in situations where the
	original font data was arranged differently. User agents that implement
	synthetic bolding and obliquing must only apply synthetic styling in
	cases where the font descriptors imply this is needed, rather than based
	on the style attributes implied by the font data. However, variation values applied to
	fonts defined with '@font-face' will be clamped to both the values specified in
	these descriptors as well as the values supported by the font file itself.

	<div class="example">
		<p>The font descriptors defined in this section are used for selecting a font
		from within the set of fonts defined by <code>@font-face</code> rules for
		a given family.</p>

		<p>Consider a family containing a single, regular face:</p>

		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: BaskervilleSimple;
		  src: url(baskerville-regular.woff);
		}
		</pre>

		<p>Unstyled text would display using the regular face defined in the
		<code>@font-face</code> rule:</p>

		<div class="figure"><img alt="regular face display" src="fiddlesticks-regular.png" width="373" /></div>

		<p>However, italic text would display in most user agents using synthetically
		obliqued glyphs from the regular face, since a separate italic face is not defined:</p>

		<div class="figure"><img alt="synthetic italics display" src="fiddlesticks-synitalics.png" width="373" /></div>

		<p>Now consider a family for which an actual italic face is defined:</p>
		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: BaskervilleFull;
		  src: url(baskerville-regular.woff);
		}

		@font-face {
		  font-family: BaskervilleFull;
		  src: url(baskerville-italic.woff);
		  font-style: italic;
		}
		</pre>

		<p>The second <code>@font-face</code> rule defines the font resource
		<code>baskerville-italic.woff</code> to have style attributes of
		normal weight, normal stretch and italic style. When displaying italic
		text, the user agent will use this font, since it's the closest
		match for italic text. Thus, the text will display using glyphs
		designed by a type designer rather than using synthetically obliqued
		glyphs from the regular face:</p>

		<div class="figure"><img alt="real italics display" src="fiddlesticks-italics.png" width="373" /></div>

		<p>See the section on <a href="#font-style-matching">font matching</a>

	</div>

<h2 id="font-matching-algorithm">Font Matching Algorithm</h2>

	The algorithm below describes how fonts are associated with
	individual runs of text.  For each character in the run a font
	family is chosen and a particular font face is selected
	containing a glyph for that character.

<h3 id="font-family-casing">Case sensitivity of font family names</h3>

	As part of the font matching algorithm outlined below, user agents must
	match font family names used in style rules with actual font family names
	contained in fonts available in a given environment or with font family names defined in
	<code>@font-face</code> rules.  User agents must match these names case
	insensitively, using the "Default Caseless Matching" algorithm outlined
	in the Unicode specification [[!UNICODE]].  This algorithm is detailed
	in section 3.13 entitled "Default Case Algorithms".  Specifically, the
	algorithm must be applied without normalizing the strings involved and
	without applying any language-specific tailorings.  The case folding
	method specified by this algorithm uses the case mappings with status field
	"C" or "F" in the CaseFolding.txt file of the Unicode Character Database.

	<p class="note">
	For authors this means that font family names are matched case
	insensitively, whether those names exist in a platform font or
	in the <code>@font-face</code> rules contained in a stylesheet.
	Authors should take care to ensure that names use a character sequence
	consistent with the actual font family name, particularly when using
	combining characters such as diacritical marks. For example, a family
	name that contains an uppercase A (U+0041) followed by a combining
	ring (U+030A) will <strong>not</strong> match a name that looks
	identical but which uses the precomposed lowercase a-ring character
	(U+00E5) instead of the combining sequence.</p>

	<p class="note">
	Implementors should take care to verify that a given caseless string comparison
	implementation uses this precise algorithm and not assume that a given
	platform string matching routine follows it, as many of these have
	locale-specific behavior or use some level of string normalization.</p>

<h3 id="font-style-matching">Matching font styles</h3>

	The procedure for choosing a font for a given character in a run of
	text consists of iterating over the font families named by the 'font-family' property, selecting
	a font face with the appropriate style based on other font properties
	and then determining whether a glyph exists for the given character.
	This is done using the <dfn>character map</dfn> of the font, data
	which maps characters to the default glyph for that character. A font
	is considered to <dfn>support</dfn> a given character if (1) the
	character is contained in the font's <em>character map</em> and (2) if
	required by the containing script, shaping information is available
	for that character.

	Some legacy fonts may include a given character
	in the <em>character map</em> but lack the shaping information (e.g.
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/ttochap1.htm">OpenType layout tables</a> or
	<a href="https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=projects&amp;item_id=graphite_techAbout">Graphite tables</a>)
	necessary for correctly rendering text runs containing that character.

	Codepoint sequences consisting of a base character followed by a
	sequence of combining characters are treated slightly differently, see
	the section on <a href="#cluster-matching">cluster matching</a>
	below.

	For this procedure, the <dfn>default face</dfn> for a given font
	family is defined to be the face that would be selected if all font
	style properties were set to their initial value.

	<ol id="fontmatchingalg">

		<li>Using the computed font property values for a given element,
		the user agent starts with the first family name
		specified by the 'font-family' property.
		</li>

		<li>If the family name is a generic family keyword, the user agent
		looks up the appropriate font family name to be used.  User
		agents may choose the generic font family to use based on the
		language of the containing element or the Unicode range of the
		character.
		</li>

		<li>For other family names, the user agent attempts to find the
		family name among fonts defined via <code>@font-face</code> rules and then
		among available installed fonts, matching names with a
		<a href="#font-family-casing">case-insensitive comparison</a> as outlined
		in the section above.
		On systems containing fonts with multiple localized font family
		names, user agents must match any of these names independent of the
		underlying system locale or platform API used.  If the font
		resources defined for a given face in an <code>@font-face</code> rule are either
		not available or contain invalid font data, then the face should be
		treated as not present in the family. If no faces are present for a
		family defined via <code>@font-face</code> rules, the family should be treated as
		missing; matching a platform font with the same name must not occur
		in this case.
		</li>

		<li>If a font family match occurs, the user agent assembles the set
		of font faces in that family and then narrows the set to a single
		face using other font properties in the order given below. Fonts may
		present in this group which can support a range of
		'font-stretch', 'font-style', or 'font-weight' properties. In
		this case, the algorithm proceeds as if each supported combination of
		values are a unique font in the set. If such a font is ultimately
		selected by this algorithm, particular values for
		'font-stretch', 'font-style', and 'font-weight' must be applied
		before any layout or rendering occurs. The application of these values
		must be applied in the <a href="#apply-font-matching-variations">Apply
		font matching variations</a> step detailed in
		<a href="#font-feature-variation-resolution">Font Feature and Variation
		Resolution</a>.
		A group
		of faces defined via <code>@font-face</code> rules with identical font
		descriptor values but differing 'unicode-range' values are considered to be
		a single <dfn>composite face</dfn> for this step:

		<ol id="fontstylematchingalg">

		<li>'font-stretch' is tried first. If a font
		does not have any concept of varying strengths of stretch values, its stretch value
		is mapped according table in the <a href="#stretchmappings">property definition</a>.
		If the matching set includes faces with width values
		containing the 'font-stretch' desired value, faces with width values which do not include the desired width value
		are removed from the matching set. If there is no face
		which contains the desired value, a stretch value is chosen using the rules below:
		  <ul>
		    <li>If the desired stretch value is less than 100, stretch values below the
		    desired stretch value are checked in descending order followed by
		    stretch values above the desired stretch value in ascending order until a
		    match is found.</li>
		    <li>Otherwise, stretch values above the
		    desired stretch value are checked in ascending order followed by
		    stretch values below the desired stretch value in descending order until a
		    match is found.</li>
		  </ul>
		Once the
		closest matching width has been determined by this process,
		faces with widths which do not include this determined width are removed from the matching set.

		<div class="example" id="ascendingstretch">

		This search algorithm can be thought of as a distance function, where the lowest-distance value present in the font family is selected, and all fonts not including that value are eliminated.

		Consider a font family with three fonts, named A, B, and C, each with associated supported ranges for the 'font-stretch' descriptor. If an element is styled with "font-stretch: 125", the search algorithm can be visualized as follows:

		<img src="stretchdistance.svg">

		The font stretch ranges supported by fonts A, B, and C are shown in the graph above. As you can see, because font B contains the minimum stretch value across the entire family, font B would be selected by this algorithm. However, if font B were somehow eliminated from the family, font C would then contain the lowest distance in the family, so it would be selected.

		<li id="font-style-matching">'font-style' is tried next.

		is mapped according to the description in the 'font-style' property definition.

		If the value of 'font-style' is 'italic':
		<ol>

		If an oblique angle was found in the above search, all faces which don't include that oblique angle are excluded from the matching set. Otherwise, if an italic value was found in the above search, all faces which don't include that italic value are excluded from the matching set.

		User Agents are not required to distinguish between italic and oblique fonts. In such User Agents, the 'font-style' matching steps above are performed by mapping both italic values and oblique angles onto a common scale. The exact nature of this mapping is undefined, however, an italic value of 1 must map to the same value that an oblique angle of 20deg maps to. Within font
		families defined via <code>@font-face</code> rules, italic and oblique
		faces must be distinguished using the value of the

If the matching set after performing the steps above includes faces with weight values containing the font-weight desired value, faces with weight values which do not include the desired font-weight value are removed from the matching set. If there is no face which contains the desired value, a weight value is chosen using the rules below:
		  <ul>
		    <li>If the desired weight is 400, 400 is checked first, 500 is checked second and then
		    the rule for desired weights less than or equal to 500 is used.</li>

		    the rule for desired weights less than or equal to 500 is used.</li>
		    <li>If the desired weight is less than or equal to 500, weights below the

		<em>default face</em> if that face supports a given glyph and synthesis
		of these faces is permitted by the value of the 'font-synthesis' property.

<h2 id="font-feature-variation-resolution">Font Feature and Variation Resolution</h3>

	As described in the previous section, font features and variations can be enabled
	in a variety of ways, either via the use of 'font-variant',
	'font-feature-settings', 'font'
	'font-variation-settings' in a style rule or within an <code>@font-face</code> rule.
	The resolution order for the union of these settings is defined below.
	Features defined via CSS properties are applied on top of layout engine
	default features.

<h3 id="default-features">Default features</h3>

	For OpenType fonts, user agents must enable the default features defined
	in the OpenType documentation for a given script and writing mode.  Required ligatures,
	common ligatures and contextual forms must be enabled by default
	(OpenType features: <span class="tag">rlig, liga, clig, calt</span>),
	along with localized forms (OpenType feature: <span class="tag">locl</span>),
	and features required for proper display of composed characters and marks
	(OpenType features: <span class="tag">ccmp, mark, mkmk</span>).  These features
	must always be enabled, even when the value of the
	'font-variant' and 'font-feature-settings' properties is 'normal'.
	Individual features are only disabled when explicitly overridden by the author, as when
	'font-variant-ligatures' is set to 'no-common-ligatures'.
	For handling complex scripts such as
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/arabicot/features.aspx">Arabic</a>,
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/mongolot/features.htm">Mongolian</a> or
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/devanot/features.aspx">Devanagari</a>
	additional features are required.  For upright text within vertical text runs, vertical
	alternates (OpenType feature: <span class="tag">vert</span>) must be enabled.</p>

<h3 id="feature-variation-precedence">Feature and variation precedence</h3>

	General and <em>font specific</em> font feature property settings are
	resolved in the order below, in ascending order of precedence.  This ordering is
	used to construct a combined list of font features that affect a given
	text run.

	<ol>
		<li>Font features enabled by default, including features required for a given script.</li>

		<li id="apply-font-matching-variations">Font variations as enabled by the 'font-weight',
		'font-stretch', and 'font-style' properties.

		The application of the value enabled by
		'font-style' is affected by font selection, because this property might select an
		italic or an oblique font. The value applied is the closest matching value as determined
		by the <a href="font-style-matching">font matching algorithm</a>. User Agents must apply
		at most one value due to the 'font-style' property; both 'ital' and 'slnt' values should
		not be set together.

		If the selected font is defined in an '@font-face' rule, then the values applied at this step
		should be clamped to the value of the 'font-weight', 'font-stretch', and 'font-style'
		descriptors in that '@font-face' rule.

		Then, the values applied in this step should be clamped (possibly again) to the values
		that are supported by the font.
		</li>

		<li>If the font is defined via an <code>@font-face</code> rule, the font features
		implied by the font-variant descriptor in the <code>@font-face</code> rule.</li>

		<li>If the font is defined via an <code>@font-face</code> rule, the font features
		implied by the font-feature-settings descriptor in the <code>@font-face</code> rule.</li>

		<li>Font variations implied by the value of the 'font-optical-sizing' property.</li>

		<li>Font features implied by the value of the 'font-variant' property,
		the related 'font-variant' subproperties and any other CSS property
		that uses OpenType features (e.g. the 'font-kerning' property).</li>

		<!-- other CSS props override 'font-variant' but not 'font-feature-settings' -->
		<!-- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Aug/0110.html -->

		<li>Feature settings determined by properties other than 'font-variant' or
		'font-feature-settings'. For example, setting a
		non-default value for the 'letter-spacing' property disables common ligatures.</li>

		<li>Font variations implied by the value of the 'font-variation-settings' property.
		These values should be clamped to the values that are supported by the font.</li>

		<li>Font features implied by the value of 'font-feature-settings' property.</li>
	</ol>

	This ordering allows authors to set up a general set of defaults
	for fonts within their <code>@font-face</code> rules, then override them with
	property settings for specific elements.  General property settings
	override the settings in <code>@font-face</code> rules and low-level font feature
	settings override 'font-variant' property settings.

	For situations where the combined list of font feature settings
	contains more than one value for the same feature, the last value is
	used. When a font lacks support for a given underlying font feature,
	text is simply rendered as if that font feature was not enabled; font
	fallback does not occur and no attempt is made to synthesize the
	feature except where explicitly defined for specific properties.

<h3 id="feature-precedence-examples">Feature precedence examples</h3>

	<div class="example">
		<p>With the styles below, numbers are rendered proportionally when used within
		a paragraph but are shown in tabular form within tables of prices:</p>

		<pre>body {
		  font-variant-numeric: proportional-nums;
		}

		table.prices td {
		  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
		}
		</pre>
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		<p>When the <span title="font-variant!!descriptor">font-variant</span> descriptor
		is used within an <code>@font-face</code> rule, it only
		applies to the font defined by that rule.</p>

		<pre>@font-face {
		  font-family: MainText;
		  src: url(http://example.com/font.woff);
		  font-variant: oldstyle-nums proportional-nums styleset(1,3);
		}

		body {
		  font-family: MainText, Helvetica;
		}

		table.prices td {
		  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
		}
		</pre>

		<p>In this case, old-style numerals will be used throughout but only
		where the font "MainText" is used. Just as in the previous example,
		tabular values will be used in price tables since 'tabular-nums'
		appears in a general style rule and its use is mutually exclusive with
		'proportional-nums'.  Stylistic alternate sets will only be used where
		MainText is used.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		<p>The <code>@font-face</code> rule can also be used to access font features in locally available
		fonts via the use of <code>local()</code> in the 'src' descriptor of the <code>@font-face</code> definition:</p>

		<pre>@font-face {
		  font-family: BodyText;
		  src: local("HiraMaruPro-W4");
		  font-variant: proportional-width;
		  font-feature-settings: "ital"; /* Latin italics within CJK text feature */
		}

		body { font-family: BodyText, serif; }
		</pre>

		<p>If available, a Japanese font "Hiragino Maru Gothic" will be used.  When text
		rendering occurs, Japanese kana will be proportionally spaced and Latin text will
		be italicised.  Text rendered with the fallback serif font will use default
		rendering properties.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		<p>In the example below, discretionary ligatures are enabled only for a downloadable font
		but are disabled within spans of class "special":</p>

		<pre>@font-face {
		  font-family: main;
		  src: url(fonts/ffmeta.woff) format("woff");
		  font-variant: discretionary-ligatures;
		}

		body         { font-family: main, Helvetica; }
		span.special { font-variant-ligatures: no-discretionary-ligatures; }
		</pre>

		<p>Suppose one adds a rule using 'font-feature-settings' to enable discretionary ligatures:</p>

		<pre>body         { font-family: main, Helvetica; }
		span         { font-feature-settings: "dlig"; }
		span.special { font-variant-ligatures: no-discretionary-ligatures; }
		</pre>

		<p>In this case, discretionary ligatures <em>will</em> be rendered within spans of class "special".
		This is because both the 'font-feature-settings' and 'font-variant-ligatures' properties
		apply to these spans.  Although the 'no-discretionary ligatures' setting of 'font-variant-ligatures'
		effectively disables the OpenType <span class="tag">dlig</span> feature, because the font-feature-settings'
		is resolved after that, the 'dlig' value reenables discretionary ligatures.</p>

<h3>Optical sizing control: the 'font-optical-sizing' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-optical-sizing
	Value: auto | none
	Initial: auto
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: n/a
	Computed value: as specified
	Media: visual
	Animatable: no
	</pre>

	Typographically, text rendered at different sizes often benefits from slightly different visual representations. For example, to aid reading at small text sizes, strokes is often thicker with larger serifs. Larger text often has a more delicate figure with more contrast between thicker and thinner strokes.

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn id="font-optical-sizing-auto-value" title="auto!!font-optical-sizing">auto</dfn></dt>
		<dd>The user agent may modify the shape of glyphs based on the font-size and the pixel density of the screen. For OpenType and TrueType fonts using font variations, this is often done by using the "opsz" font variation.</dd>
		<dt><dfn id="font-optical-sizing-none-value" title="none!!font-optical-sizing">none</dfn></dt>
		<dd>The user agent must not modify the shape of glyphs for optical size.</dd>
	</dl>

	<div id="optical-size-example" class="figure"><img alt="text with different optical sizes, normalized to similar physical sizes" src="Century_Expanded-a-normalized.jpg" /><p class="caption">Each size of Century Expanded as it existed in analog metal form. The different optical sizes, normalized here to the same physical size, have design variations to maintain stylistic traits and improve readability.</p></div>

	'font-size' must be considered when selection a variation value for the 'opsz' axis, but other signals may also be considered.

	Note: User Agents are expected to supply a value for the 'opsz' axis which is close to the used value for 'font-size'. However, User Agents may wish to consider other factors such as pixel density of the screen, or the solid angle the text subtends in the viewer's retina. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/807#issue-195683688">Experiments have shown</a>, however, that disregarding these other ancillary factors and using only 'font-size' may be the best way for a User Agent to select this value.

	Pixel density as well as visual size of the text may influence the variation value chosen for 'font-optical-sizing'. When either pixel density or visual size of the text changes in response to a user operation or style change, user agents may choose a new value for this variation value only if the change is layout-causing. User agents are free to determine which changes are layout-causing.

	Note: Some user operations, such as pinch-zoom, may be considered not-layout-causing if they do not cause text to reflow. However, other user operations, such as increasing text size for accessiblity purposes, may be considered layout-causing because they cause text to reflow. Similarly, the 'transform' property may be considered not-layout-causing because transforms generally do not cause text to reflow. Each user-agent is free to decide whether or not each operation is layout-changing or not.

	User Agents must not synthesize optical sizing when it is not performed by the font directly.

	User Agents must not select a value for the 'opsz' axis which is not supported by the font used for rendering the text. This may be accomplished by clamping a chosen value to the range supported by the font.

<h3>Low-level font variation settings control: the 'font-variation-settings' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-variation-settings
	Value: normal | [ <<string>> <<number>>] #
	Initial: normal
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: n/a
	Computed value: as specified
	Media: visual
	Animatable: yes (see description)
	</pre>

	This property provides low-level control over OpenType or TrueType font
	variations. It is intended as a way of providing access to font variations
	that are not widely used but are needed for a particular use case.

	When possible, authors should generally use the other properties related
	to font variations such as 'font-optical-sizing'
	whenever possible and only use this
	property for special cases where its use is the only way of accessing
	a particular infrequently used font variation.

	A value of 'normal' means that no change in glyph shape, matching, or positioning occurs due to this property.

	The <<string>> is a case-sensitive OpenType or TrueType variation axis name. As
	specified in the OpenType / TrueType specifications, axis names contain four
	ASCII characters. Axis name strings longer or shorter than four characters,
	or containing characters outside the U+20&ndash;7E codepoint range are
	invalid. Axis names need only
	match an axis tag defined in the font, so they are not limited to
	explicitly registered OpenType / TrueType variation axes. Fonts defining custom axis names should follow the
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/fvar.htm">name rules</a>
	defined in the OpenType specification.

	Axis values not present in the font are ignored and therefore have no effect; a user agent must
	not attempt to synthesize fallback behavior based on these axis tags. Other axis values
	within the same CSS 'font-variation-settings' statement are not ignored.

	Axis values greater or less than the range supported by the font are clamped to the closest value supported by
	the font.

	Values are allowed to be fractional or negative.

	If the same axis name appears twice, the second one supercedes the first.

	Although specifically defined for OpenType / TrueType variations, variation axes
	for other modern font formats that support font variations may be
	added in the future. Where possible, variations defined for other font
	formats should attempt to follow the pattern of registered variation axes.

	Animating font-variation-settings is possible using a mechanism similar to animating
	the 'transform' property: Two declarations of font-feature-settings can be animated between
	if they are "like". "Like" declarations are ones where the same set of properties appear (in any order).
	If two declarations are "like" then animation occurs pairwise between
	corresponding values in the declarations. Otherwise, animation is not possible. In this situation,
	the "from" values of the animation are swapped to the "to" values at an unspecified time during
	the animation.

<h2 id="color-font-support">Color Font Support</h2>

	Color fonts allow for font files to describe not just the contours describing the edges of glyphs, but also the colors present inside the glyphs.

	Issue: Add a picture.

<h3 id="font-palette-prop">Controlling Color Font Palettes: The 'font-palette' property</h3>

	Many color font file formats allow colors within glyphs to be parameterized. In these fonts, colors are referenced by index when describing the geometry of each glyph. These indices are resolved within a current active palette using a lookup table present inside the font. However, many fonts contain multiple palettes, each containing a set of complimentary colors chosen by the font designer to provide pleasing visual results.

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-palette

		</dd>
	</dl>

	Issue: Add examples and pictures.

	<h3 id="font-palette-values">User-defined font color palettes: The '@font-palette-values' rule</h3>

	The '@font-palette-values' rule defines a color palette and associates that color palette with a specific font. This allows a web author to select arbitrary colors to use inside a color font rather than being limited to the preexisting palettes inside font files. In addition, this rule's association with a specific font allows a name of a palette to apply differently to different fonts, which allows similar colors to be used across multiple fonts when multiple fonts are used in an element (i.e. for font fallback). A web author may wish to create multiple palettes for a single font in order to create multiple themes for their web content. A web author may also wish to create matching palettes for multiple fonts to achieve a consistent design across a collection of different fonts.

	A '@font-palette-values' rule represents a palette of colors used in a font. A palette consists of an ordered collection of colors. Using the '@font-palette-values' allows a web author to reference a palette existing within a font as well as creating a palette populated with author-defined colors. In addition, it allows overriding a set of colors from a palette in the font with colors described by the web author.

	The '@font-palette-values' rule consists of the '@font-palette-values' at-keyword followed by a block of descriptor declarations. In terms of the grammar, this specification defines the following productions:

	<pre><dfn>font_palette_values_rule</dfn>
  : <i>FONT_PALETTE_VALUES_SYM</i> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#scanner"><i>S</i></a>* '{' <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#scanner"><i>S</i></a>* <i>descriptor_declaration</i>? [ ';' <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#scanner"><i>S</i></a>* <i>descriptor_declaration</i>? ]* '}' <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#scanner"><i>S</i></a>*
  ;

<dfn>descriptor_declaration</dfn>
  : <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#grammar"><i>property</i></a> ':' <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#scanner"><i>S</i></a>* <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html#grammar"><i>expr</i></a>
  ;</pre>

	<p>The following new token is introduced:</p>

	<pre>@{F}{O}{N}{T}{-}{P}{A}{L}{E}{T}{T}{E}{-}{V}{A}{L}{U}{E}{S} {return <dfn>FONT_PALETTE_VALUES_SYM</dfn>;}</pre>

	<div class="example">
	<p>Modify Handover Sans's color palette</p>
	<pre>@font-palette-values Augusta {

		font-family: Handover Sans;
		base-palette: 3;
		1: rgb(43, 12, 9);
		3: var(--highlight);
	}</pre>
	</div>

	The presence of a particular descriptor within in '@font-palette-values' has semantic meaning; missing descriptors are not filled in with default values. These descriptors apply solely within the context of the @font-palette-values rule in which they are defined, and do not apply to document language elements. When a given descriptor occurs multiple times in a given '@font-palette-values' rule, only the last descriptor declaration is used and all prior declarations for that descriptor are ignored.

	A given set of '@font-palette-values' rules define which author-defined palettes are available for use within the documents that contain these rules.

	An author-defined font color palette is only available to the documents that reference it. Using an author-defined color palette outside of the documents that reference it would constitute a security leak since the contents of one page would be able to affect other pages, something an attacker could use as an attack vector.

	This at-rule follows the forward-compatible parsing rules of CSS. Like properties in a declaration block, declarations of any descriptors that are not supported by the user agent must be ignored. @font-palette-values rules require a font-family descriptor; if it is missing, the @font-palette-values rule is invalid and must be ignored entirely.

	In cases where user agents have limited platform resources, do not implement support for color fonts, or implement the ability to disable color fonts, '@font-palette-values' rules must simply be ignored; the behavior of individual descriptors as defined in this specification should not be altered.

	<h3 id="font-family-desc">Font family: the 'font-family' descriptor</h3>

    <pre class='descdef mq'> 
    Name: font-family
    Value: <<font-family>>
    For: @font-palette-values
    </pre>

    This descriptor defines the font family name that this palette applies to. This palette will only ever be applied to the font with this name. The value of this descriptor matches the definition of the <<family-name>> for the 'font-family' property. This means that only named font families are allowed and rules that including generic or installed fonts in the list of font families are syntax errors. If syntax errors occur within the font family list, the entire rule must be ignored.

	<h3 id="base-palette-desc">Specifying the base palette: the 'base-palette' descriptor</h3>

    <pre class='descdef mq'> 
    Name: base-palette
    Value: <<integer>>
    For: @font-palette-values
    </pre>

    This descriptor specifies a palette in the font which the containing '@font-palette-values' rule uses as an initial value. If no <<integer>> keys are present in the '@font-palette-values' rule, then the '@font-palette-values' rule represents the palette in the font with the same index as the value of this descriptor. If <<integer>> keys are present in the '@font-palette-values' rule, each one of those descriptors overrides a single color in the color palette represented by this '@font-palette-values' block.

	<div class="example">
	<p>Rename Handover Sans's 3rd color palette</p>
	<pre>@font-palette-values Augusta {

		font-family: Handover Sans;
		base-palette: 3;
	}</pre>
	</div>

    If this descriptor is not present in the '@font-palette-values', a value of 0 is used. If the font does not contain a palette at the index of the value of 'base-palette', a value of 0 is used. If a font does not contain any color palettes, no colors are included in the initial color palette represented by this '@font-palette-values' rule. Colors can be added to the color palette by using the <<integer>> descriptor in the '@font-palette-values' rule.

	<h3 id="palette-integer-desc">Overriding a color in the palette: The <<integer>> descriptor</h3>

    <pre class='descdef mq'> 
    Name: <<integer>>
    Value: <<color>>
    For: @font-palette-values
    </pre>

    This descriptor overrides or adds a color to the initial color palette represented by this '@font-palette-values' rule. If the initial color palette represented by the '@font-palette-values' rule (i.e. by using the 'base-palette' descriptor) already includes a color at the index of this descriptor's key, that color is overwritten by the color specified in this descriptor's value. Otherwise, a new color is added to this color palette at the index of this descriptor's key.

	<div class="example">
	<p>Create a new color palette for Handover Sans</p>
	<pre>@font-palette-values Augusta {

		font-family: Handover Sans;
		1: rgb(43, 12, 9);
		2: rgb(208, 112, 96);
		3: var(--highlight);
	}</pre>
	</div>

    Using CSS Variables is explicitly expected to be valid in the value of this descriptor. Using CSS Variables is disallowed in the key of this descriptor. CSS Variables are resolved in the context of the element to which the 'font-palette' property applies. This means that using 'font-palette' with the same value on two different elements may result in different used palettes because the value of variables inside the '@font-palette-values' rule may apply differently in the context of those two elements.

	<h3 id="font-presentation-desc">Selecting the text presentation style: The 'font-presentation' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-presentation
	Value: auto | text | emoji 
	Initial: auto
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: N/a
	Computed value: As specified
	Media: visual
	Animatable: No (see below)
	</pre>

	ISSUE: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1092">Bikeshed the name.</a>

	This property allows web authors to select whether emoji presentation or text presentation is used for certain emoji code points. Traditionally, these presentation styles were selected by appending Variation Selector 15 (U+FE0E) or Variation Selector 16 (U+FE0F) to certain code points. However, 'font-presentation' allows web authors to set a default presentation style which can replace the variation selectors.

	Only the code points <a href="http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-variants.html">listed</a> by Unicode as contributing to a Unicode Presentation Sequence are affected by this property. Within this CSS specification, these characters are referred to as <span id="presentation-participating-code-points">Presentation Participating Code Points</span>. This property has no effect on any other characters.

	This property is expected to affect font fallback; however, the exact nature of the interaction of font fallback with 'font-presentation' is explicitly unspecified. However, a variation selector must be included in a previous cluster as defined by the <a href="#cluster-matching">cluster matching</a> section above. Therefore, the presence of a variation selector is treated as ancillary data to inform the font fallback routine. A natural result of this behavior is that a variation selector must not be rendered in a different font than the previous character.

	Even when 'font-presentation' is used, the presence of Variation Selector 15 (U+FE0E) or Variation Selector 16 (U+FE0F) in the contents of an element override the rendering specified in 'font-presentation'. Therefore, 'font-presentation' sets a default presentation which the text being rendered can opt out of.

	Note: Different platforms have different conventions about how to handle emoji presentation sequences. A cross-platform UA may wish to follow the conventions of each inividual platform, or it may wish to use the same approach on all platforms. When tasked with a request for an emoji style rendering, a UA may wish to disregard fonts which do not include color tables. A different UA may wish instead to use the same mechanical cluster fallback algorithm that it would use for any arbitrary cluster.

	Variation selectors other than FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 and U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 must not have any affect on font selection. If one of these variation selectors is present, but unsupported by the font previously selected, the variation selector is ignored.
