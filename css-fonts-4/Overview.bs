<p class="advisement"><strong>This document contains ideas and
experiments that may or may not end up in the final version of a CSS
Fonts specification. Implementors are encouraged to ask about the status
of a particular feature listed here on the <code>www-style</code>
mailing list.</strong></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The CSS3 Fonts specification ([[!CSS-FONTS-3]]) describes the basic
controls CSS provides for selecting and using fonts within documents.
The ideas here are additions or modifications to the properties and
rules defined in CSS3 Fonts.</p>

	Issue: Please note that OpenType/TrueType variation font support
	is still in intial stages of specification and implementation. Please
	comment on any bugs in this spec at <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues">
	https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues</a>. Also, please note that this
	spec is incomplete and only includes some of the text from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/">
	https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/</a>.

<p></p>

<h2 id="basic-font-props">Basic Font Properties</h2>

<p>The particular font face used to render a character is determined by
the font family and other font properties that apply to a given element.
 This structure allows settings to be varied independent of each
other.</p>

<h3 id="font-family-prop">Font family: the 'font-family' property</h3>

    Issue: Import from level 3

<h3 id="font-weight-prop">Font weight: the 'font-weight' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-weight
	Value: normal | bold | bolder | lighter | <<number>>
	Initial: normal
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: n/a
	Computed value: numeric weight value (see description)
	Media: visual
	</pre>

	The 'font-weight' property specifies the weight of glyphs in the font, their degree of blackness or stroke thickness.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=font-weight dfn-type=value>
		<dt id="font-weight-numeric-values"><dfn><<number>></dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			These values form an ordered sequence, where each number indicates a weight that is
at least as dark as its predecessor. Only values between 1 - 999 are valid, and all other values are treated as parse errors. Certain numeric values correspond to the commonly used weight names below (Note that a font may internally provide its own mappings, but those mappings within the font are disregarded):

			<ul>
			<li>100 - Thin</li>
			<li>200 - Extra Light (Ultra Light)</li>
			<li>300 - Light</li>
			<li>400 - Normal</li>
			<li>500 - Medium</li>
			<li>600 - Semi Bold (Demi Bold)</li>
			<li>700 - Bold</li>
			<li>800 - Extra Bold (Ultra Bold)</li>
			<li>900 - Black (Heavy)</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>normal</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Same as '400'.
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>bold</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Same as '700'.
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>bolder</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies a bolder weight than the inherited value.
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>lighter</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies a lighter weight than the inherited value.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	Font formats that use a scale other than a nine-step scale should map
	their scale onto the CSS scale so that 400 roughly corresponds with a
	face that would be labeled as Regular, Book, Roman and 700 roughly
	matches a face that would be labeled as Bold. Or weights may be
	inferred from the style names, ones that correspond roughly with the
	scale above. The scale is relative, so a face with a larger weight value
	must never appear lighter. If style names are used to infer weights,
	care should be taken to handle variations in style names across locales.

	Quite often there are only a few weights available for a particular
	font family. When a weight is specified for which no face exists, a
	face with a nearby weight is used. In general, bold weights map to faces
	with heavier weights and light weights map to faces with lighter weights
	(see the <a href="#font-matching-algorithm">font matching section
	below</a> for a precise definition). The examples here illustrate which
	face is used for different weights, grey indicates a face for that
	weight does not exist so a face with a nearby weight is used:

	<div class="figure"><img alt="weight mappings for a family with 400, 700 and 900 weights" src="optimaweights.png" /><p class="caption">Weight mappings for a font family with 400, 700 and 900 weight faces</p></div>

	<div class="figure"><img alt="weight mappings for a family with 300, 600 weights" src="hiraginoweights.png" /><p class="caption">Weight mappings for a font family with 300 and 600 weight faces</p></div>

	Most user agents model a font has having a particular weight which often
	corresponds to the list <a href="#font-weight-numeric-values">above</a>.
	While this is true of most fonts, some fonts may be configurable so as to
	support a range of weights. In this situation, the user agent uses a face
	with a weight as close as possible to the weight requested (see the
	<a href="#font-matching-algorithm">font matching section below</a> for the
	precise algorithm). In particular, a user agent using a font which supports
	a range of weights should behave the same as if a font is present at each
	individual weight in the range. For TrueType / OpenType fonts which use variations, the "wght"
	variation is used to implement varying weights. Fractional weights are
	valid.

	Although the practice is not well-loved by typographers, bold faces are often
	synthesized by user agents for faces that lack actual bold faces. For
	the purposes of style matching, these faces must be treated as if they
	exist within the family. Authors can explicitly avoid this behavior
	by using the 'font-synthesis' property.

	Specified values of 'bolder' and 'lighter' indicate weights
	relative to the weight of the parent element.  The computed weight is
	calculated based on the inherited 'font-weight' value using the chart
	below.

	<table id="bolderlighter" class="data" summary="Bolder/lighter mappings">
	<thead>
	<tr>
	  <th>Inherited value</th>
	  <th>bolder</th>
	  <th>lighter</th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr><th>- 99</th><td>400</td><td>No change</td></tr>
	<tr><th>100 - 349</th><td>400</td><td>100</td></tr>
	<tr><th>350 - 549</th><td>700</td><td>100</td></tr>
	<tr><th>550 - 749</th><td>900</td><td>400</td></tr>
	<tr><th>750 - 899</th><td>900</td><td>700</td></tr>
	<tr><th>900 -</th><td>No change</td><td>700</td></tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>

	The table above is equivalent to selecting the next relative bolder or lighter face,
	given a font family containing normal and bold faces along with a thin and a heavy face.
	Authors who desire finer control over the exact weight values used for a given element
	may use numerical values instead of relative weights.

<h3 id="font-stretch-prop">Font width: the 'font-stretch' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-stretch
	Value: normal | ultra-condensed | extra-condensed | condensed | semi-condensed | semi-expanded | expanded | extra-expanded | ultra-expanded | <<percentage>>
	Initial: normal
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: Not resolved.
	Computed value: numeric weight value (see description)
	Media: visual
	Animatable: As <<number>>
	</pre>

	The 'font-stretch' property selects a normal,
	condensed, or expanded face from a font family. Absolute keyword values are aliased to
	have the following meaning (Note that a font may internally provide its own mappings, but those mappings within the font are disregarded):

	<table id="stretchmappings" class="data" summary="font-stretch numeric mappings">
	<thead>
	<tr>
	  <th>Absolute keyword value</th>
	  <th>Numeric value</th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr><th>ultra-condensed</th><th>50%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>extra-condensed</th><th>62.5%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>condensed</th><th>75%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>semi-condensed</th><th>87.5%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>normal</th><th>100%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>semi-expanded</th><th>112.5%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>expanded</th><th>125%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>extra-expanded</th><th>150%</th></tr>
	<tr><th>ultra-expanded</th><th>200%</th></tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>

	Negative values are not allowed and are treated as parse errors.
	When a face does not exist
	for a given width, values less than 100% map to a narrower face,
	otherwise a wider face. Conversely, values greater than or equal to 100% map to a wider
	face, otherwise a narrower face. Some fonts may support a range of stretch
	values; if the requested stretch value is not available in the font, the
	closest supported value should be used, using the same mapping rules (see the
	<a href="#font-matching-algorithm">font matching section below</a> for the
	precise algorithm). For TrueType / OpenType fonts which use variations, the "wdth"
	variation is used to implement varying widths. The figure below shows how nine
	font-stretch property settings affect font matching for font family
	containing a variety of discrete widths. Grey indicates a width for which no
	face exists and a different width is substituted:

	<div class="figure"><img alt="width mappings for a family with condensed, normal and expanded faces" src="universwidths.png" /><p class="caption">Width mappings for a font family with condensed, normal and expanded width faces</p></div>

<h3 id="font-style-prop">Font style: the 'font-style' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: font-style
	Value: normal | italic | oblique <<angle>>?
	Initial: normal
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: n/a
	Computed value: As specified
	Media: visual
	Animatable: If both "from" and "to" values are "oblique", then yes, as an <<angle>>. Otherwise, no.
	</pre>

	The 'font-style' property allows
	italic or oblique faces to be selected. Italic forms are generally cursive in nature while oblique faces are
	typically sloped versions of the regular face.  Oblique faces can be simulated by artificially sloping the
	glyphs of the regular face. Compare the artificially sloped renderings of Palatino "a" and Baskerville "N"
	in grey with the actual italic versions:

	<div class="figure"><img alt="artificial sloping vs. real italics" src="realvsfakeitalics.png" /><p class="caption">Artificial sloping versus real italics</p></div>

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=font-style dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>normal</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Matches against a face that is classified as a normal face, one that is neither italic or obliqued. This represents an oblique value of "0".
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>italic</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Matches against a font that is labeled as an oblique face, or an italic face if one is not.
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>oblique <<angle>>?</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Controls matching against an oblique face. The lack of a number represents an angle of "20deg". Values less than or equal to -90deg or values greater than or equal to 90deg are invalid and are treated as parse errors. (Note that a font may internally provide its own mapping for "oblique", but that mapping within the font is disregarded)
		</dd>
	</dl>

	Some font families may contain only zero or one italic or oblique face, while yet other
	families may contain multiple oblique faces with varying
	angles. The font matching routine will select a font to use which
	is closest to the requested angle. In general, for a requested angle greater
	or equal to 20deg, larger angles are prefered; otherwise, smaller
	angles are preferred (see the
	<a href="#font-matching-algorithm">font matching section below</a> for
	the precise algorithm). Fractional and negative values are accepted, but values
	less than or equal to -90 as well as values greater than or equal to 90 are not
	allowed and are treated as parse errors.
	For TrueType / OpenType fonts which use variations, the "slnt"
	variation is used to implement oblique values, and the "ital" variation with a value of "1"
	is used to implement the italic values. The meaning of a
	negative value for "oblique" is to slope the text in the opposite
	direction. If no italic or oblique face is available, oblique faces can be
	synthesized by rendering non-obliqued faces with an artificial
	obliquing operation. The use of these artificially obliqued faces
	can be disabled using the 'font-synthesis' property. The details
	of the obliquing operation are not explicitly defined.

	<p class="note">Authors should also be aware that synthesized
	approaches may not be suitable for scripts like Cyrillic, where italic
	forms are very different in shape.  It is always better to use an actual
	italic font rather than rely on a synthetic version.</p>

	<!-- resolution on the "undefined" nature of synthetics: https://www.w3.org/2013/06/06-css-minutes.html#item03 -->

	Many scripts lack the tradition of mixing a cursive form within
	text rendered with a normal face.  Chinese, Japanese and Korean fonts
	almost always lack italic or oblique faces.  Fonts that support a
	mixture of scripts will sometimes omit specific scripts such as Arabic
	from the set of glyphs supported in the italic face. User agents
	should be careful about making <em>character map</em> assumptions across
	faces when implementing support for <em>system font fallback</em>.

<h3 id="font-size-prop">Font size: the 'font-size' property</h3>

    Issue: Import from level 3

<h2 id="font-resources">Font Resources</h2>

<h3 id="src-desc">Font reference: the 'src' descriptor</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: src
	Value: [ <<url>> [ format( <<string>> # )]? | <<font-face-name>> ] #
	For: @font-face
	Initial: N/A
	</pre>

	This descriptor specifies the resource containing font data. It is
	required for the <code>@font-face</code> rule to be valid. Its value
	is a  prioritized, comma-separated list of external references or
	locally-installed font face names. When a font is needed the user
	agent iterates over the set of references listed, using the first one
	it can successfully activate. Activation of a font involves downloading
	the file or reading it from disk, parsing it, and perhaps additional user-agent-dependent steps.
	Fonts containing invalid data or local
	font faces that are not found are ignored and the user agent loads the
	next font in the list.

	As with other URLs in CSS, the URL may be relative, in which case it
	is resolved relative to the location of the style sheet containing the
	<code>@font-face</code> rule. In
	the case of SVG fonts, the URL points to an element within a document
	containing SVG font definitions.  If the element reference is omitted,
	a reference to the first defined font is implied.  Similarly, font
	container formats that can contain more than one font must load one
	and only one of the fonts for a given <code>@font-face</code> rule. Fragment
	identifiers are used to indicate which font to load.  If a container
	format lacks a defined fragment identifier scheme, implementations
	should use a simple 1-based indexing scheme (e.g. "font-collection#1"
	for the first font, "font-collection#2" for the second font).

	<pre>
	src: url(fonts/simple.woff);   /* load simple.woff relative to stylesheet location */
	src: url(/fonts/simple.woff);  /* load simple.woff from absolute location */
	src: url(fonts.svg#simple);    /* load SVG font with id 'simple' */
	</pre>

	External references consist of a URL, followed by an optional hint
	describing the format of the font resource referenced by that URL. The
	format hint contains a comma-separated list of format strings that
	denote well-known font formats. Conformant user agents must skip
	downloading a font resource if the format hints indicate only
	unsupported or unknown font formats.  If no format hints are supplied,
	the user agent should download the font resource.

	<pre>
	/* load WOFF font if possible, otherwise use OpenType font */
	@font-face {
	  font-family: bodytext;
	  src: url(ideal-sans-serif.woff) format("woff"),
	       url(basic-sans-serif.ttf) format("opentype");
	}
	</pre>

	<p>Format strings defined by this specification:
	</p>

	<table class="data" id="fontformats">
		<thead>
			<tr>
			  <th>String</th>
			  <th>Font Format</th>
			  <th>Common extensions</th>
			</tr>

			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	Given the overlap in common usage between TrueType and OpenType, the
	format hints "truetype" and "opentype" must be considered as synonymous;
	a format hint of "opentype" does not imply that the font contains
	Postscript CFF style glyph data or that it contains OpenType layout
	information (see <a href="#platform-props-to-css">Appendix A</a> for more background on this).

	A value of "woff-variations", "truetype-variations", or "opentype-variations" imply support
	of the "woff", "truetype", or "opentype" formats respectively along with additional support for
	font variations. Web authors can specify this format to indicate that variation support is required
	for correct rendering of a font. This mechanism can be used for gracefully falling back to an
	ancillary font when variation support is not present.

	When authors would prefer to use a locally available
	copy of a given font and download it if it's not, <code>local()</code>
	can be used. The locally-installed 'font-face-name'
	argument to <code>local()</code> is a format-specific string that
	uniquely identifies a single font face within a larger family.  The
	syntax for a 'font-face-name' is a unique font face
	name enclosed by "local(" and ")".  The name can optionally be
	enclosed in quotes.  If unquoted, the unquoted font family name
	processing conventions apply; the name must be a sequence of
	identifiers separated by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-syntax/#whitespace">whitespace</a>
	which is converted to a string by joining the identifiers together
	separated by a single space.

	<pre>
	/* regular face of Gentium */
	@font-face {
	  font-family: MyGentium;
	  src: local(Gentium),    /* use locally available Gentium */
	       url(Gentium.woff); /* otherwise, download it */
	}
	</pre>

	For OpenType and TrueType fonts, this string is used to match only
	the Postscript name or the full font name in the name table of locally
	available fonts. Which type of name is used varies by platform and
	font, so authors should include both of these names to assure proper
	matching across platforms. Platform substitutions for a given font
	name must not be used.

	<pre>
	/* bold face of Gentium */
	@font-face {
	  font-family: MyGentium;
	  src: local(Gentium Bold),    /* full font name */
	       local(Gentium-Bold),    /* Postscript name */
	       url(GentiumBold.woff);  /* otherwise, download it */
	  font-weight: bold;
	}
	</pre>

	Just as a <code>@font-face</code> rule specifies the characteristics of a single font
	within a family, the unique name used with <code>local()</code> specifies a single
	font, not an entire font family. Defined in terms of
	OpenType font data, the Postscript name is found in the font's
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm">name table</a>,
	in the name record with nameID = 6 (see
	[[!OPENTYPE]] for more details).  The Postscript name is the commonly
	used key for all fonts on OSX and for Postscript CFF fonts under
	Windows. The full font name (nameID = 4) is used as a unique key for
	fonts with TrueType glyphs on Windows.

	For OpenType fonts with multiple localizations of the full font name, the US
	English version is used (language ID = 0x409 for Windows and language ID = 0 for Macintosh)
	or the first localization
	when a US English full font name is not available (the OpenType
	specification recommends that <a
	href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm">all fonts
	minimally include US English names</a>). User agents that also match
	other full font names, e.g. matching the Dutch name when the current
	system locale is set to Dutch, are considered non-conformant. This is
	done not to prefer English but to avoid matching inconsistencies across
	font versions and OS localizations, since font style names (e.g. "Bold")
	are frequently localized into many languages and the set of
	localizations available varies widely across platform and font version.
	User agents that match a concatenation of family name (nameID = 1) with
	style name (nameID = 2) are considered non-conformant.

	This also allows for referencing faces that belong to larger
	families that cannot otherwise be referenced.

	<div class="example">
		<p>Use a local font or reference an SVG font in another document:</p>
		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: Headline;
		  src: local(Futura-Medium),
		       url(fonts.svg#MyGeometricModern) format("svg");
		}
		</pre>
		<p>Create an alias for local Japanese fonts on different platforms:</p>
		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: jpgothic;
		  src: local(HiraKakuPro-W3), local(Meiryo), local(IPAPGothic);
		}
		</pre>
		<p>Reference a font face that cannot be matched within a larger family:</p>
		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: Hoefler Text Ornaments;
		  /* has the same font properties as Hoefler Text Regular */
		  src: local(HoeflerText-Ornaments);
		}
		</pre>

		<p>Since localized fullnames never match, a document with the header
		style rules below would always render using the default serif font, regardless
		whether a particular system locale parameter is set to Finnish or not:</p>
		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: SectionHeader;
		  src: local("Arial Lihavoitu");  /* Finnish fullname for Arial Bold, should fail */
		  font-weight: bold;
		}

		h2 { font-family: SectionHeader, serif; }
		</pre>

		<p>A conformant user agent would never load the font 'gentium.eot' in the
		example below, since it is included in the first definition of the 'src' descriptor
		which is overridden by the second definition in the same <code>@font-face</code> rule:</p>

		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: MainText;
		  src: url(gentium.eot);                     /* for use with older user agents */
		  src: local("Gentium"), url(gentium.woff);  /* Overrides src definition */
		}
		</pre>
	</div>

<h3 id="font-prop-desc">Font property descriptors: the 'font-style', 'font-weight', and 'font-stretch' descriptors</h3>

	These descriptors define the characteristics of a font face and are
	used in the process of matching styles to specific faces. For a font

	download all faces in the family or use these descriptors to selectively
	download font faces that match actual styles used in document. The
	meaning of the values for these descriptors are the same as those for the corresponding
	font properties except that relative keywords are not allowed, 'bolder' and
	'lighter'. If these descriptors are omitted, initial
	values are assumed. If specified values are out of range of the accepted values
	of the property of the same name, the descriptor is treated as a parse error.

	Ranges are accepted in these three descriptors in place of a single value. Where a single
	value is specified, it has the same meaning as a range with identical startpoint and
	endpoint. User agents may swap the computed value of the startpoint and endpoint of the range
	in order to forbid decreasing ranges. Both endpoints are inclusive.
	The ranges are used in the <a href="#font-matching-algorithm">Font Matching Algorithm</a> below.

	The value for these font face style attributes is used in place of
	the style implied by the underlying font data.  This allows authors to
	combine faces in flexible combinations, even in situations where the
	original font data was arranged differently. User agents that implement
	synthetic bolding and obliquing must only apply synthetic styling in
	cases where the font descriptors imply this is needed, rather than based
	on the style attributes implied by the font data.

	<div class="example">
		<p>The font descriptors defined in this section are used for selecting a font
		from within the set of fonts defined by <code>@font-face</code> rules for
		a given family.</p>

		<p>Consider a family containing a single, regular face:</p>

		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: BaskervilleSimple;
		  src: url(baskerville-regular.woff);
		}
		</pre>

		<p>Unstyled text would display using the regular face defined in the
		<code>@font-face</code> rule:</p>

		<div class="figure"><img alt="regular face display" src="fiddlesticks-regular.png" width="373" /></div>

		<p>However, italic text would display in most user agents using synthetically
		obliqued glyphs from the regular face, since a separate italic face is not defined:</p>

		<div class="figure"><img alt="synthetic italics display" src="fiddlesticks-synitalics.png" width="373" /></div>

		<p>Now consider a family for which an actual italic face is defined:</p>
		<pre>
		@font-face {
		  font-family: BaskervilleFull;
		  src: url(baskerville-regular.woff);
		}

		@font-face {
		  font-family: BaskervilleFull;
		  src: url(baskerville-italic.woff);
		  font-style: italic;
		}
		</pre>

		<p>The second <code>@font-face</code> rule defines the font resource
		<code>baskerville-italic.woff</code> to have style attributes of
		normal weight, normal stretch and italic style. When displaying italic
		text, the user agent will use this font, since it's the closest
		match for italic text. Thus, the text will display using glyphs
		designed by a type designer rather than using synthetically obliqued
		glyphs from the regular face:</p>

		<div class="figure"><img alt="real italics display" src="fiddlesticks-italics.png" width="373" /></div>

		<p>See the section on <a href="#font-style-matching">font matching</a>

		face within a font family.</p>
	</div>

<h2 id="font-matching-algorithm">Font Matching Algorithm</h2>

	The algorithm below describes how fonts are associated with
	individual runs of text.  For each character in the run a font
	family is chosen and a particular font face is selected
	containing a glyph for that character.

<h3 id="font-family-casing">Case sensitivity of font family names</h3>

	As part of the font matching algorithm outlined below, user agents must
	match font family names used in style rules with actual font family names
	contained in fonts available in a given environment or with font family names defined in
	<code>@font-face</code> rules.  User agents must match these names case
	insensitively, using the "Default Caseless Matching" algorithm outlined
	in the Unicode specification [[!UNICODE]].  This algorithm is detailed
	in section 3.13 entitled "Default Case Algorithms".  Specifically, the
	algorithm must be applied without normalizing the strings involved and
	without applying any language-specific tailorings.  The case folding
	method specified by this algorithm uses the case mappings with status field
	"C" or "F" in the CaseFolding.txt file of the Unicode Character Database.

	<p class="note">
	For authors this means that font family names are matched case
	insensitively, whether those names exist in a platform font or
	in the <code>@font-face</code> rules contained in a stylesheet.
	Authors should take care to ensure that names use a character sequence
	consistent with the actual font family name, particularly when using
	combining characters such as diacritical marks. For example, a family
	name that contains an uppercase A (U+0041) followed by a combining
	ring (U+030A) will <strong>not</strong> match a name that looks
	identical but which uses the precomposed lowercase a-ring character
	(U+00E5) instead of the combining sequence.</p>

	<p class="note">
	Implementors should take care to verify that a given caseless string comparison
	implementation uses this precise algorithm and not assume that a given
	platform string matching routine follows it, as many of these have
	locale-specific behavior or use some level of string normalization.</p>

<h3 id="font-style-matching">Matching font styles</h3>

	The procedure for choosing a font for a given character in a run of
	text consists of iterating over the font families named by the 'font-family' property, selecting
	a font face with the appropriate style based on other font properties
	and then determining whether a glyph exists for the given character.
	This is done using the <dfn>character map</dfn> of the font, data
	which maps characters to the default glyph for that character. A font
	is considered to <dfn>support</dfn> a given character if (1) the
	character is contained in the font's <em>character map</em> and (2) if
	required by the containing script, shaping information is available
	for that character.

	Some legacy fonts may include a given character
	in the <em>character map</em> but lack the shaping information (e.g.
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/ttochap1.htm">OpenType layout tables</a> or
	<a href="https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=projects&amp;item_id=graphite_techAbout">Graphite tables</a>)
	necessary for correctly rendering text runs containing that character.

	Codepoint sequences consisting of a base character followed by a
	sequence of combining characters are treated slightly differently, see
	the section on <a href="#cluster-matching">cluster matching</a>
	below.

	For this procedure, the <dfn>default face</dfn> for a given font
	family is defined to be the face that would be selected if all font
	style properties were set to their initial value.

	<ol id="fontmatchingalg">

		<li>Using the computed font property values for a given element,
		the user agent starts with the first family name
		specified by the 'font-family' property.
		</li>

		<li>If the family name is a generic family keyword, the user agent
		looks up the appropriate font family name to be used.  User
		agents may choose the generic font family to use based on the
		language of the containing element or the Unicode range of the
		character.
		</li>

		<li>For other family names, the user agent attempts to find the
		family name among fonts defined via <code>@font-face</code> rules and then
		among available system fonts, matching names with a
		<a href="#font-family-casing">case-insensitive comparison</a> as outlined
		in the section above.
		On systems containing fonts with multiple localized font family
		names, user agents must match any of these names independent of the
		underlying system locale or platform API used.  If the font
		resources defined for a given face in an <code>@font-face</code> rule are either
		not available or contain invalid font data, then the face should be
		treated as not present in the family. If no faces are present for a
		family defined via <code>@font-face</code> rules, the family should be treated as
		missing; matching a platform font with the same name must not occur
		in this case.
		</li>

		<li>If a font family match occurs, the user agent assembles the set
		of font faces in that family and then narrows the set to a single
		face using other font properties in the order given below. Fonts may
		present in this group which can support a range of
		'font-stretch', 'font-style', or 'font-weight' properties. In
		this case, the algorithm proceeds as if each supported combination of
		values are a unique font in the set. If such a font is ultimately
		selected by this algorithm, particular values for
		'font-stretch', 'font-style', and 'font-weight' must be applied
		before any layout or rendering occurs. The application of these values
		must be applied in the <a href="#apply-font-matching-variations">Apply
		font matching variations</a> step detailed in
		<a href="#font-feature-variation-resolution">Font Feature and Variation
		Resolution</a>.
		A group
		of faces defined via <code>@font-face</code> rules with identical font
		descriptor values but differing 'unicode-range' values are considered to be
		a single <dfn>composite face</dfn> for this step:

		<ol id="fontstylematchingalg">

		<li>'font-stretch' is tried first. If a font
		does not have any concept of varying strengths of stretch values, its stretch value
		is mapped according table in the <a href="#stretchmappings">property definition</a>.
		If the matching set includes faces with width values
		containing the 'font-stretch' desired value, faces with other width
		values are removed from the matching set. If there is no face
		which contains the desired value, a stretch value is chosen using the rules below:
		  <ul>
		    <li>If the desired stretch value is less than 100, stretch values below the
		    desired stretch value are checked in descending order followed by
		    stretch values above the desired stretch value in ascending order until a
		    match is found.</li>
		    <li>Otherwise, stretch values above the
		    desired stretch value are checked in ascending order followed by
		    stretch values below the desired stretch value in descending order until a
		    match is found.</li>
		  </ul>
		Once the
		closest matching width has been determined by this process,
		faces with widths which do not include this determined width are removed from the matching set.
		</li>

		<li>'font-style' is tried next.
		If the value of 'font-style' is 'italic', italic faces are
		checked first, then oblique, then normal faces.  If the value
		is 'oblique', oblique faces are checked first, then italic
		faces and then normal faces. If the value is 'normal',
		normal faces are checked first, then oblique faces, then
		italic faces. When checking oblique faces, an oblique angle is chosen using the rules below:
		<ul>
		    <li>If the desired oblique angle is greater than or equal to 0deg and less than 20deg, oblique angles below the
		    desired oblique angle are checked in descending order until 0deg or a negative value is reached. Next, oblique angles above the
		    desired oblique angle are checked in ascending order.</li>
		    <li>If the desired oblique angle is greater than or equal to 20deg, oblique angles greater than
		    the desired oblique angle are checked in ascending order. Next, oblique angles less than or equal to 20deg
		    are checked in descending order until 0deg or a negative value is reached.
		    <li>Otherwise, the same steps as above are performed, substituting negative values for the positive ones above.</li>
		</ul>
		During this operation, if an oblique font does not have any concept of varying oblique angles, it is assumed to have an angle of 20deg.
		If the search for a normal or italic face successfully determined a font, faces with other style values are excluded
		from the matching set. Otherwise, if the search for an oblique face successfully determined a font, fonts with oblique angles which do not include
		this determined angle are excluded from the matching set. User agents are permitted to
		distinguish between italic and oblique faces within platform
		font families but this is not required, so all
		italic or oblique faces may be treated as italic faces or oblique faces with an angle of 20deg. However, within font
		families defined via <code>@font-face</code> rules, italic and oblique
		faces must be distinguished using the value of the
		'font-style' descriptor.
		For families that lack any italic or oblique faces, users agents
		may create artificial oblique faces, if this is permitted by the
		value of the 'font-synthesis' property.
		</li>

		<li>'font-weight' is matched
		next. If a font
		does not have any concept of varying strengths of weights, its weight
		is mapped according list in the <a href="#font-weight-numeric-values">property definition</a>.
		If bolder/lighter relative weights are used, the
		effective weight is calculated based on the inherited weight
		value, as described in the definition of the 'font-weight'
		property. Given the desired weight and the weight ranges of faces
		in the matching set after the steps above, if the desired
		weight is available inside the weight range of a font in the matching set, then that face matches. Otherwise, a weight
		is chosen using the rules below:
		  <ul>
		    <li>If the desired weight is 400, 500 is checked first and then
		    the rule for desired weights less than 450 is used.</li>
		    <li>If the desired weight is 500, 400 is checked first and then
		    the rule for desired weights less than 450 is used.</li>
		    <li>If the desired weight is less than 450, weights below the
		    desired weight are checked in descending order followed by
		    weights above the desired weight in ascending order until a
		    match is found.</li>
		    <li>If the desired weight is greater than or equal to 450 and not
		    equal to 500, weights above the
		    desired weight are checked in ascending order followed by
		    weights below the desired weight in descending order until a
		    match is found.</li>
		  </ul>
		Once the closest matching weight has been determined by this process,
		faces with weights which do not include this determined width are removed from the matching set.
		</li>

		<li>'font-size' must be
		matched within a UA-dependent margin of tolerance. (Typically, sizes
		for scalable fonts are rounded to the nearest whole pixel, while the
		tolerance for bitmapped fonts could be as large as 20%.) Further
		computations, e.g., by 'em' values in other properties, are based on
		the 'font-size' value that
		is used, not the one that is specified.
		</li>

		</ol>
		Note that more than one font may be remaining in the matching set after performing
		the above steps. If so, the user agent must choose a single font from
		the matching set and continue these steps with it. The choice of which
		font to choose may differ between multiple user agents and multiple operating
		system platforms; however, it must not differ between two elements in the same document.
		</li>

		<li><p>If the matched face is defined via <code>@font-face</code>
		rules, user agents must use the procedure below to select a single
		font:

		<ol>
		<li>If the font resource has not been loaded and the range of
		characters defined by the 'unicode-range' descriptor value
		includes the character in question, load the font.</li>
		<li>After downloading, if the <em>effective character map</em>
		supports the character in question, select that font.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>When the matched face is a <em>composite face</em>, user agents must use
		the procedure above on each of the faces in the <em>composite face</em> in
		reverse order of <code>@font-face</code> rule definition.</p>

		<p>While the download occurs, user agents may either wait until the
		font is downloaded or render once with substituted font metrics and
		render again once the font is downloaded.</p>
		</li>

		<li><p>If no matching face exists or the matched face does not contain
		a glyph for the character to be rendered, the next family name is
		selected and the previous three steps repeated.  Glyphs from other
		faces in the family are not considered.  The only exception is that
		user agents may optionally substitute a synthetically obliqued version of the
		<em>default face</em> if that face supports a given glyph and synthesis
		of these faces is permitted by the value of the 'font-synthesis' property.
		For example, a synthetic italic version of the regular face may be used if the
		italic face doesn't support glyphs for Arabic.</p>

		<!-- resolution on the above: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Nov/0292.html -->

		<li>If there are no more font families to be evaluated and no matching
		face has been found, then the user agent performs a <dfn>system font
		fallback</dfn> procedure to find the best match for the character to be
		rendered.  The result of this procedure may vary across user agents.
		</li>

		<li>If a particular character cannot be displayed using any
		font, the user agent should indicate by some means that a
		character is not being displayed, displaying either a
		symbolic representation of the missing glyph (e.g. using a <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_resort_font">Last
		Resort Font</a>) or using the missing character glyph from
		a default font.
		</li>

	</ol>

	<p>Optimizations of this process are allowed provided that an
	implementation behaves as if the algorithm had been followed exactly.
	Matching occurs in a well-defined order to ensure that the results are
	as consistent as possible across user agents, given an identical set
	of available fonts and rendering technology.</p>

	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#font-relative-lengths"><em>font-relative lengths</em></a>

<h2 id="font-feature-variation-resolution">Font Feature and Variation Resolution</h3>

	As described in the previous section, font features and variations can be enabled
	in a variety of ways, either via the use of 'font-variant',
	'font-feature-settings', 'font'
	'font-variation-settings' in a style rule or within an <code>@font-face</code> rule.
	The resolution order for the union of these settings is defined below.
	Features defined via CSS properties are applied on top of layout engine
	default features.

<h3 id="default-features">Default features</h3>

	For OpenType fonts, user agents must enable the default features defined
	in the OpenType documentation for a given script and writing mode.  Required ligatures,
	common ligatures and contextual forms must be enabled by default
	(OpenType features: <span class="tag">rlig, liga, clig, calt</span>),
	along with localized forms (OpenType feature: <span class="tag">locl</span>),
	and features required for proper display of composed characters and marks
	(OpenType features: <span class="tag">ccmp, mark, mkmk</span>).  These features
	must always be enabled, even when the value of the
	'font-variant' and 'font-feature-settings' properties is 'normal'.
	Individual features are only disabled when explicitly overridden by the author, as when
	'font-variant-ligatures' is set to 'no-common-ligatures'.
	For handling complex scripts such as
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/arabicot/features.aspx">Arabic</a>,
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/mongolot/features.htm">Mongolian</a> or
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/devanot/features.aspx">Devanagari</a>
	additional features are required.  For upright text within vertical text runs, vertical
	alternates (OpenType feature: <span class="tag">vert</span>) must be enabled.</p>

<h3 id="feature-variation-precedence">Feature and variation precedence</h3>

	General and <em>font specific</em> font feature property settings are
	resolved in the order below, in ascending order of precedence.  This ordering is
	used to construct a combined list of font features that affect a given
	text run.

	<ol>
		<li>Font features enabled by default, including features required for a given script.</li>

		<li id="apply-font-matching-variations">Font variations as enabled by the 'font-weight',
		'font-stretch', and 'font-style' properties.</li>

		<li>If the font is defined via an <code>@font-face</code> rule, the font features
		implied by the font-variant descriptor in the <code>@font-face</code> rule.</li>

		<li>If the font is defined via an <code>@font-face</code> rule, the font features
		implied by the font-feature-settings descriptor in the <code>@font-face</code> rule.</li>

		<li>Font variations implied by the value of the 'font-optical-size' property.</li>

		<li>Font features implied by the value of the 'font-variant' property,
		the related 'font-variant' subproperties and any other CSS property
		that uses OpenType features (e.g. the 'font-kerning' property).</li>

		<!-- other CSS props override 'font-variant' but not 'font-feature-settings' -->
		<!-- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Aug/0110.html -->

		<li>Feature settings determined by properties other than 'font-variant' or
		'font-feature-settings'. For example, setting a
		non-default value for the 'letter-spacing' property disables common ligatures.</li>

		<li>Font variations implied by the value of the 'font-variation-settings' property.</li>

		<li>Font features implied by the value of 'font-feature-settings' property.</li>
	</ol>

	This ordering allows authors to set up a general set of defaults
	for fonts within their <code>@font-face</code> rules, then override them with
	property settings for specific elements.  General property settings
	override the settings in <code>@font-face</code> rules and low-level font feature
	settings override 'font-variant' property settings.

	For situations where the combined list of font feature settings
	contains more than one value for the same feature, the last value is
	used. When a font lacks support for a given underlying font feature,
	text is simply rendered as if that font feature was not enabled; font
	fallback does not occur and no attempt is made to synthesize the
	feature except where explicitly defined for specific properties.

<h3 id="feature-precedence-examples">Feature precedence examples</h3>

	<div class="example">
		<p>With the styles below, numbers are rendered proportionally when used within
		a paragraph but are shown in tabular form within tables of prices:</p>

		<pre>body {

		  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
		}

	</div>

	<div class="example">

		}

		body {
		  font-family: MainText, Helvetica;

		table.prices td {
		  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
		}
		</pre>

		<p>In this case, old-style numerals will be used throughout but only
		where the font "MainText" is used. Just as in the previous example,
		tabular values will be used in price tables since 'tabular-nums'
		appears in a general style rule and its use is mutually exclusive with
		'proportional-nums'.  Stylistic alternate sets will only be used where
		MainText is used.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		<p>The <code>@font-face</code> rule can also be used to access font features in locally available

		  font-family: BodyText;

		  font-variant: proportional-width;
		  font-feature-settings: "ital"; /* Latin italics within CJK text feature */
		}

		body { font-family: BodyText, serif; }
		</pre>

		<p>If available, a Japanese font "Hiragino Maru Gothic" will be used.  When text
		rendering occurs, Japanese kana will be proportionally spaced and Latin text will
		be italicised.  Text rendered with the fallback serif font will use default
		rendering properties.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		<p>In the example below, discretionary ligatures are enabled only for a downloadable font

		  font-variant: discretionary-ligatures;
		}

		body         { font-family: main, Helvetica; }
		span.special { font-variant-ligatures: no-discretionary-ligatures; }
		</pre>

		<p>Suppose one adds a rule using 'font-feature-settings' to enable discretionary ligatures:</p>

		span         { font-feature-settings: "dlig"; }
		span.special { font-variant-ligatures: no-discretionary-ligatures; }
		</pre>

		<p>In this case, discretionary ligatures <em>will</em> be rendered within spans of class "special".
		This is because both the 'font-feature-settings' and 'font-variant-ligatures' properties
		apply to these spans.  Although the 'no-discretionary ligatures' setting of 'font-variant-ligatures'
		effectively disables the OpenType <span class="tag">dlig</span> feature, because the font-feature-settings'
		is resolved after that, the 'dlig' value reenables discretionary ligatures.</p>

	This property provides low-level control over OpenType or TrueType font
	variations. It is intended as a way of providing access to font variations
	that are not widely used but are needed for a particular use case.

	When possible, authors should generally use the other properties related
	to font variations such as 'font-optical-sizing'
	whenever possible and only use this
	property for special cases where its use is the only way of accessing
	a particular infrequently used font variation.

	A value of 'normal' means that no change in glyph shape, matching, or positioning occurs due to this property.

	The <<string>> is a case-sensitive OpenType or TrueType variation axis name. As
	specified in the OpenType / TrueType specifications, axis names contain four
	ASCII characters. axis name strings longer or shorter than four characters,
	or containing characters outside the U+20&ndash;7E codepoint range are
	invalid. Axis names need only
	match a feature tag defined in the font, so they are not limited to
	explicitly registered OpenType / TrueType variation axes. Fonts defining custom axis names should follow the
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/fvar.htm">name rules</a>
	defined in the OpenType specification.

	Axis values not present in the font are ignored and therefore have no effect on font matching; a user agent must
	not attempt to synthesize fallback behavior based on these feature
	tags.

	Values are allowed to be fractional or negative.

	When values greater or less than the range supported by the font are
	specified, the value is ignored and therefore has no effect on font matching.

	If the same axis name appears twice, the second one supercedes the first.

	Although specifically defined for OpenType / TrueType variations, variation axes
	for other modern font formats that support font variations may be
	added in the future. Where possible, variations defined for other font
	formats should attempt to follow the pattern of registered variation axes.

	Animating font-variation-settings is possible using a mechanism similar to animating
	the 'transform' property: Two declarations of font-feature-settings can be animated between
	if they are "like". "Like" declarations are ones where the same set of properties appear (in any order).
	If two declarations are "like" then animation occurs pairwise between
	corresponding values in the declarations. Otherwise, animation is not possible. In this situation,
	the "from" values of the animation are swapped to the "to" values at an unspecified time during
	the animation.

<h2 id="font-palette-control">Controlling font palette colors</h2>

<div>
	Resolved at 2015 Sydney to add font-palette control.
	<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Feb/0211.html">Original proposal</a>.

	Details: multicolor fonts now exist.
	They expose several "palette indexes" that can be given different colors.
	They might also expose predefined palettes.
	We want to be able to tell the browser to use a predefined palette,
	or to provide our own colors for a palette.

	Final proposal is:

	1. Add a 'font-palette' property.  For now the grammar is just:

		<pre class=prod><<integer>> | light | dark | <<named-palette-color>>#</pre>

		with <<integer>> selecting the nth palette in the font,
		and ''light'' and ''dark'' selecting the first palette designated "light" or "dark"
		(this is metadata that's already part of the format).
		If there's any font fallback, the fallback fonts don't use a palette.
	2. Add ''@palette-entries'' to ''@font-feature-values'',
		with the name of each declaration defining a name for a particular palette color,
		and the value being an integer for the index of that palette color.
		<<named-palette-color>> is <code><<ident>> <<color>></code>.
		Any palette colors not given an explicit value default to value of 'color'
		(so by default it just renders solidly with 'color' value, as normal).
		If a palette color name occurs more than once, the last one wins
		(so you can declare a palette in a variable, and override bits as desired).

<h2 id="expanded-font-weight-scale">Expanding the scale of <code>font-weight</code></h2>

<p>Expand the range of weights possible within the <code>font-weight</code>
property and <code>font-weight</code> descriptor to include integer values within
the range [1..1000]. Define precisely how the font matching algorithm works
when using weights in this range.</p>

<p class="example">Example of using new font weights mixed with old ones</p>

<h2 id="min-max-font-size">Minimum and maximum <code>font-size</code></h2>

<p>Define new properties to control the minimum and maximum font-size,
<code>min-font-size</code> and <code>max-font-size</code>.</p>

<h2 id="extended-generics">New generic font families</h2>

<p>For most languages and scripts, existing generics can be mapped to
something comparable to that script. That's useful for the web so that
generics like <code>serif</code> and <code>sans-serif</code> map to
something reasonable independent of the language of the content. But
typographic traditions vary widely across the world and many scripts
have a variety of common typeface designs that don't map cleanly
into these existing generics. In situations where a similar typeface is
used across a wide variety of platforms, it's useful to extend the set
of predefined CSS generic font families to cover these type styles.</p>

<p>Add new generic font families for:</p>
<ul dfn-for=font-family dfn-type=value>
<li><dfn>system-ui</dfn> font family representing the default UI font on a given platform</li>
<li><dfn>emoji</dfn> font family for emoji characters</li>
<li><dfn>math</dfn> font family used for rendering mathematical expressions</li>
<li><dfn>fangsong</dfn> font family used for <em>fang song</em> typefaces in Chinese</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="font-synthesis-small-caps">New <code>small-caps</code> value for <code>font-synthesis</code></h2>

<p>Since small capitals are often synthesized for fonts lacking smalls-caps glyphs,
add a <code>small-caps</code> value to the <code>font-synthesis</code> property
to allow small-caps synthesis to be disabled.

<h2 id="emoji-fallback">Font fallback for emoji codepoints</h2>

<p>Many codepoints supported by emoji fonts overlap with codepoints supported
by existing fonts. In fallback situations where it's not clear whether to use
an emoji font or not, UTR51 defines a the default behavior for a given codepoint.</p>

<p class="note">Authors can explicitly control emoji or text display using selectors.</p>
