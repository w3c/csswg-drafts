<h3 id="values">
Value Definitions</h3>

This specification follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]]
using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs">value definition syntax</a> from [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values &amp; Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
all properties defined in this specification
also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> as their property value.
For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

<h2 id="basic-font-props">
Basic Font Properties</h2>

The particular font face used to render a character is determined by
the font family and other font properties that apply to a given element.
This structure allows settings to be varied independent of each
other.

	This property specifies a prioritized list of font family names or generic family names.
	A font family defines a set of faces that vary in weight, width or slope.
	CSS uses the combination of a family name with other font properties to select an individual face.
	Using this selection mechanism,
	rather than selecting a face via the style name as is often done in design applications,
	allows some degree of regularity in textual display when fallback occurs.

	Component values are a comma-separated list indicating alternatives.
	A user agent iterates through the list of family names
	until it matches an available font
	that contains a glyph for the character to be rendered.
	(See [[#cluster-matching]].)
	This allows for differences in available fonts across platforms and
	for differences in the range of characters supported by individual fonts.

	<div class="example" id="ex-font-list">
	    <pre>
	    body {
	        font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;
	    }
	    </pre>

	    If Helvetica is available, it will be used when rendering.
	    If neither Helvetica nor Verdana is present,
	    then the generic font-family ''sans-serif'' font will be used.
	</div>

	There are three types of font family names, two of which may be used with this property:

	<dl>
	    <dt><dfn id="family-name-value"><<family-name>></dfn>
	    <dd>
	        The name of a font family, such as Helvetica or Verdana in the previous example.

			This might be a locally-instaled font, or might be a web font.

	    <dt><<generic-family>>
	    <dd>
	        Each <<generic-family>> keyword represents
	        a generic font choice,
	        and behaves as a potential alias for one or more locally-installed fonts
	        belonging to the specified generic font category.
	        A <<generic-family>> can thus be used as a fallback
	        for when an author's more specific font choices are not available.

			There are three types of generic family:

			1.	Generics which apply to all Unicode characters
				and will <em>always</em> match a locally installed font.
				For example, ''monospaced''.

			2.	Generics which apply to all Unicode characters
				but may not match to a locally installed font
				on some systems.
				For example, ''ui-rounded''.

			3.	Generics which are writing-system specific,
				only apply to a subset of Unicode characters,
				and may not match to a locally installed font
				on some systems.
				For example, ''generic(fangsong)''.

	        Authors are encouraged to append a generic font family as a last alternative
	        for improved robustness,
			and to use a more specific generic font family, if applicable,
			to prefer a specific style even if the individual named font family is not available.

	        Note that <<generic-family>> keywords cannot be quoted
	        (otherwise they are interpreted as a <<family-name>>).

	        The set of generic family keywords is defined in [[#generic-font-families]].

		<dt><dfn id="system-family-name-value"><<system-family-name>></dfn>
		<dd>
			A locally installed system font, whose use is subject to certain constraints.
			In particular, it may not be used with the ''font-family'' property,
			but can be used with the ''font'' shorthand.

			The following values refer to system fonts:

			<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=font>
				<dt><dfn>caption</dfn>
				<dd>The font used for captioned controls (e.g., buttons, drop-downs, etc.).
				<dt><dfn>icon</dfn>
				<dd>The font used to label icons.
				<dt><dfn>menu</dfn>
				<dd>The font used in menus (e.g., dropdown menus and menu lists).
				<dt><dfn>message-box</dfn>
				<dd>The font used in dialog boxes.
				<dt><dfn>small-caption</dfn>
				<dd>The font used for labeling small controls.
				<dt><dfn>status-bar</dfn>
				<dd>The font used in window status bars.
			</dl>

<h4 id="family-name-syntax">
Syntax of <<family-name>>
</h4>

	<pre class=prod><l><<family-name>></l> = <<string>> | <<custom-ident>>+</pre>

	Font family names other than generic families or system font families
	must either be given quoted as <<string>>s,
	or unquoted as a sequence of one or more <<custom-ident>>.

	Note: This means most punctuation characters and digits at the start of
	each token must be escaped in unquoted font family names.

	<div class="example invalid" id="ex-no-unquoted-punctuation">
	    To illustrate this, the following declarations are invalid:

	    <pre>
	        font-family: Red/Black, sans-serif;
	        font-family: "Lucida" Grande, sans-serif;
	        font-family: Ahem!, sans-serif;
	        font-family: test@foo, sans-serif;
	        font-family: #POUND, sans-serif;
	        font-family: Hawaii 5-0, sans-serif;
	    </pre>
	</div>

	Any identifier
	which could be misinterpreted
	as a pre-defined keyword in the font-family value definition,
	or the [=CSS-wide keywords=],
	is not allowed.

	Note: this means that if you really have a font
	whose name
	is the same as one of the <<generic-family>> names,
	or the system font names,
	or the [=CSS-wide keywords=],
	it <em>must</em> be quoted.

	<div class="example" id="ex-valid-unusual-generic-like">
			To illustrate this,
			the following unusual font family names are valid
			because they are quoted:

			<pre>
				font-family: "sans-serif", sans-serif;
				font-family: "default", sans-serif;
				font-family: "initial", sans-serif;
				font-family: "inherit", sans-serif;
			</pre>
		</div>

	If a sequence of identifiers is given as a <<family-name>>,
	the computed value is the name
	converted to a string
	by joining all the identifiers in the sequence by single spaces.

	To avoid mistakes in escaping,
	it is recommended to quote font family names
	that contain white space, digits,
	or punctuation characters other than hyphens:

	<div class="example" id="ex-best-quote">
	    Quoting font families prevents escaping mistakes.
	    <pre>
	    body { font-family: "New Century Schoolbook", serif }

	    &lt;body style="font-family: '21st Century', fantasy">
	    </pre>
	</div>

	Font family <em>names</em> that happen to be the same as
	a 'font-family!!property' keyword value
	(e.g. <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> such as ''inherit'', or
	<<generic-family>> keywords such as ''serif'')
	must be quoted to prevent confusion
	with the keywords of the same names.
	UAs must not consider these keywords as matching the <<family-name>> type.

<h4 id="generic-family-name-syntax">
Syntax of <<generic-family>>
</h4>

	<!-- <pre class=prod>
		<dfn><<generic-family>></dfn> = generic(<<generic-script-specific>>) | <<generic-complete>> | <<generic-incomplete>>
		<dfn><<generic-script-specific>></dfn> = <a href="">kai</a> | fangsong | nastaliq 
		<dfn><<generic-complete>></dfn> = serif | sans-serif | system-ui | cursive | fantasy | math | monospace
		<dfn><<generic-incomplete>></dfn> = ui-serif | ui-sans-serif | ui-monospace | ui-rounded 
</pre> -->

<pre class=prod>
	<dfn><<generic-family>></dfn> = <<generic-script-specific>>| <<generic-complete>> | <<generic-incomplete>>
	<dfn><<generic-script-specific>></dfn> = ''generic(kai)'' | ''generic(fangsong)'' | ''generic(nastaliq)''
	<dfn><<generic-complete>></dfn> = ''serif'' | ''sans-serif'' | ''system-ui'' | ''cursive'' | ''fantasy'' | ''math'' | ''monospace''
	<dfn><<generic-incomplete>></dfn> = ''ui-serif'' | ''ui-sans-serif'' | ''ui-monospace'' | ''ui-rounded''
</pre>

	To make the syntax less succeptible to clashes, more recently defined generic font families are identified using a functional syntax.

	<div class="example" id="ex-generic-functional">
		<pre>
			body { font-family: "Adobe Fangsong Std R", generic(fangsong), serif}
		</pre>

		The first choice in this example is a specific, named font, in Fang Song (仿宋) style.
		The family name is enclosed in quotes as it contains space characters.
		The second is a recently added script-specific generic font; it is unicode-range specific
		and so may not match to an actual installed font on some systems;
		but if it exists it will be an example of the requested style.
		The third is a universal generic font, which is guaranteed to match on all systems.
	</div>

<h4 id="system">
Syntax of <<system-family-name>>
</h4>

	<pre class="prod">
		<l><<system-family-name>></l> = ''caption'' | ''icon'' | ''menu'' | ''message-box'' | ''small-caption'' | ''status-bar''
	</pre>

<h4 id="font-families">
Relationship Between Faces and Families
</h4>

	A font family name only specifies a name given to a set of font faces;
	it does not specify an individual face.

	<div class="example" id="ex-futura-matches">
	    For example, given the availability of the fonts below,
	    Futura would match but Futura Medium would not:
	    <figure>
	        <img alt="family and face names" src="images/familyvsfacename.png">
	        <figcaption>Family and individual face names</figcaption>
	    </figure>
	</div>

	Note: The CSS definition of font attributes used for selection
	are explicitly not intended to define a font taxonomy.
	A type designer's idea of a family can often extend
	to a set of faces that vary along axes other than just
	the standard axes of
	weight ('font-weight!!property'),
	width ('font-width!!property'),
	and slant ('font-style!!property').
	A family can vary along axes that are unique to that family.
	The CSS font selection mechanism merely
	provides a way to determine the “closest” match
	when substitution is necessary.

	Note: The precise way a set of fonts are grouped into font families
	varies depending upon the platform font management APIs.
	For example, the Windows GDI API only allows four faces to be grouped into a family,
	while the DirectWrite API,
	Core Text API,
	and other platforms support
	font families with a variety of weights, widths, and slopes
	(see [[#platform-props-to-css]] for more details).

	See [[#localized-name-matching]] below for information on how
	font-family names are matched.

<h4 id="generic-font-families">
Generic font families</h4>

	A generic font family is a font family which has a standard name (as defined by CSS), but which is an alias for an existing installed font family present on the system.
	However, a single generic font family may be a composite face
	combining different typefaces based on such things as
	the Unicode range of the character,
	the <a>content language</a> of the containing element,
	user preferences, system settings, etc.
	Different generic font families may map to the same used font.

	<wpt>
		generic-family-keywords-001.html
		generic-family-keywords-002.html
	</wpt>

	Note: Generic font families are intended to be widely implemented on many platforms, unlike arbitrary <<family-name>>s which are usually platform-specific names. They are expected to map to different fonts on different platforms. Authors may specify these generic family names if they desire their text to follow a particular design on many platforms, and are not particular about which specific font is chosen on those platforms.

	User agents should provide reasonable default choices for the generic font families,
	that express the characteristics of each family as well as possible,
	within the limits allowed by the underlying technology.
	User agents are encouraged to allow users to select alternative faces for the generic font families.

	<dl dfn-for="font-family,<generic-family>" dfn-type=value>
	    <dt id="serif-def"><dfn>serif</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Serif fonts represent
	        glyphs that have finishing strokes,
	        flared or tapering ends,
	        or have actual serifed endings (including slab serifs).
	        Serif fonts are typically proportionately-spaced.
	        They often display a greater variation between thick and thin strokes
	        than fonts from the ''sans-serif'' generic font family.

			Note: ''serif'' and ''sans-serif''
			only apply to a small handful of writing scripts.
			Their use as generic font families in CSS is historical,
			and reflects the Latin-centric nature
			of early Web development.
			Better and more widely applicable names would have been,
			for example, "modulated" and "monoline".
			However, for reasons of Web compatibility,
			these names cannot be changed.

	        CSS uses the term "serif" to apply to a font for any script,
	        although other names might be more familiar for particular scripts,
	        such as Mincho (Japanese),
	        Sung or Song (Chinese),
	        Batang (Korean).
	        For Arabic, the Naskh style would correspond to ''serif''.

	        ''serif'' must always map to at least one matched font face.

	        Note: No guarantee is placed on the character coverage of that font
	        face. Therefore, the font ''serif'' is mapped to may not end up being
	        used for all content.

	        <figure>
	            <img alt="sample serif fonts" src="images/serifexamples.png" >
	            <figcaption>Sample serif fonts</figcaption>
	        </figure>

	    <dt id="sans-serif-def"><dfn>sans-serif</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Glyphs in sans-serif fonts,
	        as the term is used in CSS,
	        are generally low contrast
	        (vertical and horizontal stems have the close to the same thickness)
	        and have stroke endings that are plain
	        (without any flaring, cross stroke, or other ornamentation).
	        Sans-serif fonts are typically proportionately-spaced.
	        They often have little variation between thick and thin strokes,
	        compared to fonts from the ''serif'' family.
	        CSS uses the term "sans-serif" to apply to a font for any script,
	        although other names might be more familiar for particular scripts,
	        such as Gothic (Japanese),
	        Hei (Chinese),
	        or Gulim (Korean).

	        ''sans-serif'' must always map to at least one matched font face.

	        Note: No guarantee is placed on the character coverage of that font
	        face. Therefore, the font ''sans-serif'' is mapped to may not end up being
	        used for all content.

	        <figure>
	            <img alt="sample sans-serif fonts" src="images/sansserifexamples.png" >
	            <figcaption>Sample sans-serif fonts</figcaption>
	        </figure>

	    <dt id="cursive-def"><dfn>cursive</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Glyphs in cursive fonts generally use a script style,
	        and the result looks more like handwritten pen or brush writing than printed letterwork.
			CSS uses the term "cursive" to apply to a font for any script,
	        although other names such as Chancery, Brush, Swing and Script are also used in font names.

	        <figure>
	            <img alt="sample cursive fonts" src="images/cursiveexamples.png" >
	            <figcaption>Sample cursive fonts</figcaption>
	        </figure>

	    <dt id="fantasy-def"><dfn>fantasy</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Fantasy fonts are primarily decorative or expressive fonts
	        that contain decorative or expressive representations of characters.
	        These do not include Pi or Picture fonts which do not represent actual characters.

	        <figure>
	            <img alt="sample fantasy fonts" src="images/fantasyexamples.png" >

	        </figure>

	    <dt id="monospace-def"><dfn>monospace</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        The sole criterion of a monospace font is that all glyphs have the same fixed width.
	        This is often used to render samples of computer code.

	        ''monospace'' must always map to at least one matched font face.

	        Note: No guarantee is placed on the character coverage of that font
	        face. Therefore, the font ''monospace'' is mapped to may not end up being

			This font family is used for Fang Song (仿宋) typefaces in Chinese.
			Fang Song is a relaxed, intermediate form
			between Song (''serif'') and Kai (''generic(kai)'').
			Typically, the horizontal lines are tilted,
			the endpoint flourishes are smaller,
			and there is less variation in stroke width,
			compared to a Song style.
			Fang Song is often used for official Chinese Government documents.

			Note: ''generic(fangsong)'' might not map to any locally installed font,
			but if it does, that font will be in Fang Song style.

	</wpt>

	The 'font-weight!!property' property specifies the weight of glyphs in the font,
	their degree of blackness, or stroke thickness.

	This property accepts values of the following:

	<pre class="prod"><dfn id="font-weight-absolute-values">&lt;font-weight-absolute&gt;</dfn> = [normal | bold | <<number [1,1000]>>]</pre>

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=font-weight dfn-type=value>
	    <dt id="font-weight-numeric-values"><dfn><<number [1,1000]>></dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Each number indicates a weight that is at least as dark as its predecessor.
	        Only values greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to 1000, are valid,
	        and all other values are <a>invalid</a>.
	        Numeric values typically correspond to the commonly used weight names below.

	        <ul>
	            <li>100 - Thin
	            <li>200 - Extra Light (Ultra Light)
	            <li>300 - Light
	            <li>400 - Normal
	            <li>500 - Medium
	            <li>600 - Semi Bold (Demi Bold)
	            <li>700 - Bold
	            <li>800 - Extra Bold (Ultra Bold)
	            <li>900 - Black (Heavy)
	        </ul>

	        Note: A font might internally provide its own weight name mappings,
	        but those mappings within the font are disregarded in CSS.

	    <dt><dfn>normal</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Same as ''400''.

	    <dt><dfn>bold</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Same as ''700''.

	    <dt><dfn>bolder</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Specifies a bolder weight than the inherited value.
	        See [[#relative-weights]].

	    <dt><dfn>lighter</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Specifies a lighter weight than the inherited value.
	        See [[#relative-weights]].
	</dl>

	Font formats that use a scale other than a nine-step scale
	should map their scale onto the CSS scale
	so that 400 roughly corresponds with a face that would be labeled as Regular, Book, Roman
	and 700 roughly matches a face that would be labeled as Bold.
	Alternately, weights may be inferred from style names
	that correspond roughly with the scale above.
	The scale is relative,
	so a face with a larger weight value must never appear lighter.
	If style names are used to infer weights,
	care should be taken to handle variations in style names across locales.

<h4 id="relative-weights">
Relative Weights</h4>

	Specified values of ''bolder'' and ''lighter'' indicate weights
	relative to the weight of the parent element.
	The computed weight is calculated based on the inherited 'font-weight!!property' value
	using the chart below.

	<table id="bolderlighter" class="data">
	    <thead>
	        <tr>
	            <th>Inherited value (<var>w</var>)
	            <th>bolder
	            <th>lighter
	    <tbody>
	        <tr><th><var>w</var> &lt; 100<td>400<td>No change
	        <tr><th>100 &le; <var>w</var> &lt; 350<td>400<td>100
	        <tr><th>350 &le; <var>w</var> &lt; 550<td>700<td>100
	        <tr><th>550 &le; <var>w</var> &lt; 750<td>900<td>400
	        <tr><th>750 &le; <var>w</var> &lt; 900<td>900<td>700
	        <tr><th>900 &le; <var>w</var><td>No change<td>700
	</table>

	Note: The table above is equivalent to selecting the next relative bolder or lighter face,
	given a font family containing normal and bold faces
	along with a thin and a heavy face.
	Authors who desire finer control over the exact weight values used for a given element
	can use numerical values instead of relative weights.

<h4 id="missing-weights">
Missing weights</h4>

	Quite often there are only a few weights available for a particular font family.
	When a weight is specified for which no face exists, a face with a nearby weight is used.
	In general, bold weights map to faces with heavier weights and light weights map to faces with lighter weights.
	(See the [[#font-matching-algorithm]] for a precise definition.)

	<div class="example" id="ex-nearby-weights">
	    The examples here illustrate which face is used for different weights.
	    Grey indicates that a face for the desired weight does not exist, so a face with a nearby weight is used.

	    <figure>
	        <img alt="weight mappings for a family with 400, 700 and 900 weights" src="images/optimaweights.png" >
	        <figcaption>Weight mappings for a font family with 400, 700 and 900 weight faces</figcaption>

	        <figcaption>Weight mappings for a font family with 300 and 600 weight faces</figcaption>
	    </figure>
	</div>

	Most user agents model a font as having a particular weight
	which often corresponds to one of the numbers in the nine-step scale
	described <a href="#font-weight-numeric-values">above</a>.
	While this is true of most fonts, some fonts might be configurable so as to support a range of weights.
	In this situation, the user agent uses a face with a weight as close as possible to the weight requested
	(see [[#font-matching-algorithm]] for the precise algorithm).
	In particular, a user agent using a font which supports a range of weights
	should behave the same as if a font is present at each individual weight in the range.
	For TrueType / OpenType fonts that use variations,
	the <code>wght</code> variation is used to implement varying weights.
	Fractional weights are valid.

	Although the practice is not well-loved by typographers,
	bold faces are often synthesized by user agents for families that lack actual bold faces.
	For the purposes of font matching,
	these faces must be treated as if they exist within the family.
	Authors can explicitly avoid this behavior by using the 'font-synthesis' property.

	The 'font-width!!property' property selects a normal,
	condensed, or expanded face from a font family.
	Values are specified either as percentages
	or as keywords which map to a percentage
	as defined in the following table:

	<table id="widthmappings" class="data">
	    <thead>
	        <tr>
	            <th>Absolute keyword value

	    </table>

	<dfn value for=font-width><<percentage [0,∞]>></dfn>
	values represent the fractional width of the glyphs,
	with 100% representing “normal” glyph widths
	(as defined by the font designer).
	Values less than 0% are <a>invalid</a>.

	When a face does not exist for a given width,
	values less than 100% map to a narrower face if one exists, otherwise a wider face.
	Conversely, values greater than or equal to 100% map to a wider face if one exists, otherwise a narrower face.
	Some fonts might support a range of width values;
	if the requested width value is not available in the font,
	the closest supported value is used, using the same mapping rules
	(see the [[#font-matching-algorithm]] for the precise algorithm).
	For TrueType / OpenType fonts that support variations,
	the <code>wdth</code> variation is used to implement varying widths.

	<div class="example" id="ex-font-width-matching">
	    The figure below shows how nine font-width property settings
	    affect font matching for a font family containing a variety of discrete widths.
	    Grey indicates a width for which no face exists and a different width is substituted:

	        <figcaption>Width mappings for a font family with condensed, normal and expanded width faces</figcaption>

	{{getComputedStyle()}} always serializes its value as a <<percentage>>, regardless of how the value was specified by the author, or whether or not a keyword happens to map to the value.

	User agents must not synthesize condensed or expanded faces
	for font families which lack such faces
	and which do not have a width variation axis.
	In particular, user agents must not geometrically stretch such faces.

	The 'font-style!!property' property allows italic or oblique faces to be selected.
	Italic forms are generally cursive in nature while oblique faces are typically sloped versions of the regular face.

	<div class="example" id="ex-faux-vs-italic">
	    Compare the artificially sloped renderings of Palatino "a" and Baskerville "N" in grey
	    with the actual italic versions:

	    <figure>
	        <img alt="artificial sloping vs. real italics" src="images/realvsfakeitalics.png" >
	        <figcaption>Artificial sloping versus real italics</figcaption>
	    </figure>
	</div>

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=font-style dfn-type=value>
	    <dt><dfn>normal</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Matches against a face that is classified as a normal face,
	        one that is neither italic or obliqued.
	        This represents an oblique value of "0".

	    <dt><dfn>italic</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Matches against a font that is labeled as an italic face,
	        or an oblique face if one does not exist.

	    <dt><dfn>oblique <<angle [-90deg,90deg]>>?</dfn>
	    <dd>
	        Controls matching against an oblique face.
	        Positive angles represent a clockwise slant;
	        negative angles represent a counter-clockwise slant.
	        The lack of an <<angle>> represents ''14deg''.
	        (Note that a font might internally provide its own mapping for "oblique",
	        but the mapping within the font is disregarded.)
	        Fractional and negative values are accepted; however,
	        values less than -90deg or values greater than 90deg are <a>invalid</a>.
			If no oblique faces exist,
			<!-- https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/514#issuecomment-402010784 -->
			and 'font-synthesis-style' has the value auto,
			a synthetic oblique face will be generated.
	</dl>

	A font family might contain no italic or oblique faces,
	only an italic face and no oblique,
	only an oblique face and no italic,
	both an oblique and an italic,
	multiple oblique faces at various angles,
	or various combinations thereof.
	The font matching routine will select a font to use
	which is of the correct sign as the requested angle,
	and (if there are multiple such faces) closest to the requested angle.
	In general, for a requested angle greater or equal to 11deg,
	larger angles are preferred;
	otherwise, smaller angles are preferred.
	(See [[#font-matching-algorithm]].)
	For TrueType / OpenType fonts that use variations,
	the <code>slnt</code> variation is used to implement oblique values,
	and the <code>ital</code> variation with a value of 1 is used to implement the italic values.

	<!-- https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3091 -->
	Note: the OpenType <code>slnt</code> axis is defined
	with a positive angle meaning a counter-clockwise slant,
	the opposite direction to CSS.
	The CSS implementation will take this into account
	when using variations
	to produce oblique faces.

	Issue: What direction should positive and negative obliques skew in vertical writing mode?
	How do we achieve skews in the opposite dimension
	(needed for vertical writing)?

	If no italic or oblique face is available,
	oblique faces may be synthesized by rendering non-obliqued faces
	with an artificial obliquing operation.
	The use of these artificially obliqued faces
	can be disabled using the 'font-synthesis' property.

	<!-- resolution on the "undefined" nature of synthetics: https://www.w3.org/2013/06/06-css-minutes.html#item03 -->

	Note: While oblique faces can be simulated by artificially sloping the glyphs of the regular face,
	this is not equivalent to a true oblique,
	in which optical stroke thicknesses are properly preserved despite the slant.
	It is always better to use an actual oblique font rather than rely on a synthetic version.

	For the purposes of font matching,
	User agents may treat ''italic'' as a synonym for ''oblique''.
	For user agents that treat these values distinctly,
	synthesis must not be performed for ''italic''.

	Note: Authors should also be aware that synthesized approaches might not be suitable
	for scripts like Cyrillic, where italic forms are very different in shape.
	It is always better to use an actual italic font rather than rely on a synthetic version.

	Note: Many scripts lack the tradition of mixing a cursive form within text rendered with a normal face.
	Chinese, Japanese and Korean fonts almost always lack italic or oblique faces.
	Fonts that support a mixture of scripts
	will sometimes omit specific scripts, such as Arabic,
	from the set of glyphs supported in the italic face.
	User agents should be careful about making <a>character map</a> assumptions across faces
	when implementing synthesis across fonts,
	as italic faces in a family can have different <a>character maps</a> than Roman faces.

	This property indicates the desired height of glyphs from the font.
	For scalable fonts, the font-size is a scale factor applied to the EM unit of the font.
	For non-scalable fonts, the font-size is converted into absolute units
	and matched against the declared font-size of the font,
	using the same absolute coordinate space for both of the matched values.

	Note: There is no requirement on how closely a glyph should fit its EM box.
	Individual fonts can have a different apparent visual size
	when rendered at the same 'font-size'.
	Additionally, glyphs might render arbitrarily far outside their EM box;
	and if they overflow their <a>containing block</a>
	can induce <a>ink overflow</a>.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=font-size dfn-type=value>
	    <dt><dfn><<absolute-size>></dfn>
	    <dd>
	        An <<absolute-size>> keyword refers to an entry in a table of font sizes
	        computed and kept by the user agent.
	        See [[#absolute-size-mapping]].

	        Possible values are:

	        <pre class=prod>[ xx-small | x-small | small | medium | large | x-large | xx-large | xxx-large ]</pre>

	    <dt><dfn><<relative-size>></dfn>
	    <dd>
	        A <<relative-size>> keyword is interpreted
	        relative to the computed 'font-size' of the parent element
	        and possibly the table of font sizes. Possible values are:

	        <pre class=prod>[ larger | smaller ]</pre>

	        If the parent element has a keyword font size in the absolute size keyword mapping table,
	        ''larger'' may compute the font size to the next entry in the table,
	        and ''smaller'' may compute the font size to the previous entry in the table.
	        For example, if the parent element has a font size of ''font-size:medium'',
	        specifying a value of ''larger'' may make the font size of the child element ''font-size:large''.

	        Instead of using next and previous items in the previous keyword table,
	        User agents may instead use a simple ratio
	        to increase or decrease the font size
	        relative to the parent element.
	        The specific ratio is unspecified,
	        but should be around 1.2&ndash;1.5.
	        This ratio may vary across different elements.

	        Note: A sight-impaired user may request a user agent use a higher ratio than default,
	        in order to aid readability.
	        In addition, a user agent may choose to use different ratios
	        when it detects paragraph text as opposed to title text.

	    <dt><dfn><<length-percentage [0,∞]>></dfn>
	    <dd>
	        A length value specifies an absolute font size
	        (independent of the user agent's font table).
	        Negative lengths are invalid.

	        A percentage value specifies an absolute font size relative
	        to the parent element's computed 'font-size'.
	        Negative percentages are invalid.

	        Note: Use of percentage values or <a>font-relative lengths</a>
	        such as ''em''s and ''rem''s
	        leads to more robust and cascadable style sheets.

	<div class="example" id="ex-specify-size">
	    The following style sheet demonstrates

	    em { font-size: 150% }
	    em { font-size: 1.5em }
	    </pre>
	</div>

	Note: The used value of this property
	can differ from its computed value
	due to 'font-size-adjust'.
	However, child elements inherit the computed 'font-size' value,
	which is not affected by 'font-size-adjust'
	(otherwise, the effect of 'font-size-adjust' would compound).

	The actual value of this property can differ from the used value
	due to the unavailability of certain font sizes.

	Note: In CSS1, the suggested scaling factor between adjacent indexes was 1.5,

	In CSS2, the suggested scaling factor for computer screen between adjacent indexes was 1.2
	which still created issues for the small sizes.
	The new scaling factor varies between each index to provide a better readability.

	To preserve readability, an UA applying these guidelines
	should nevertheless avoid creating font sizes
	of less than 9 device pixels per EM unit.

	For any given font size, the apparent size and effective legibility of text
	varies across fonts.
	For bicameral scripts such as Latin or Cyrillic that
	distinguish between upper and lowercase letters,
	the relative height of lowercase letters
	compared to their uppercase counterparts
	is a determining factor of legibility.
	This is commonly referred to as the <dfn>aspect value</dfn>
	and is equal to the x-height of a font
	divided by the font size.

	Note: For text which uses diacritics,
	too large an x-height will actually decrease legibility
	as the diacritics become cramped.

	In situations where font fallback occurs,
	fallback fonts might not share the same aspect value
	as the desired font family
	and will thus be less readable.
	The 'font-size-adjust' property is a way
	to preserve the readability of text when font fallback occurs.
	It does this by adjusting the font-size
	so that the x-height is the same
	regardless of the font used.

	<div class="example" id="ex-verdana-futura">
		The style defined below defines Verdana as the desired font family,
		but if Verdana is not available Futura or Times will be used.
		One paragraph also has font-size-adjust specified.

		<pre>
			p {
				font-family: Verdana, Futura, Times;
			}
			p.adj {
				font-size-adjust: 0.545;
			}

			&lt;p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ...&lt;/p>
			&lt;p class="adj">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ...&lt;/p>
		</pre>

		Verdana has a relatively high aspect value of 0.545,
		meaning lowercase letters are relatively tall
		compared to uppercase letters,
		so at small sizes text appears legible.
		Times has a lower aspect value of 0.447,
		and so if fallback occurs,
		the text will be less legible at small sizes than Verdana
		unless font-size-adjust is also specified.
	</div>

	How text rendered in each of these fonts compares is shown below,
	the columns show text rendered in Verdana, Futura and Times.
	The same font-size value is used across cells
	within each row and red lines are included to show the differences in x-height.
	In the upper half, each row is rendered in the same font-size value.
	The same is true for the lower half,
	but in this half the 'font-size-adjust' property is also set
	to 0.545,
	so that the actual font size is adjusted
	to preserve the x-height of Verdana across each row.
	Note how small text remains relatively legible across each row in the lower half.

	<figure>
		<img alt="text with and without 'font-size-adjust'" src="images/fontsizeadjust.png" >
		<figcaption>Text with and without the use of 'font-size-adjust'</figcaption>
	</figure>

	This property allows authors to specify an <a>aspect value</a> for an element
	that will effectively preserve the x-height of the first choice font,
	whether it is substituted or not.
	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=font-size-adjust>
		<dt><dfn id="font-size-adjust-none-value">none</dfn>
		<dd>
			Do not preserve the font's x-height.

		<dt><dfn id="aspect-ratio-value"><<number [0,∞]>></dfn>

		<dd>
			Specifies the <a>aspect value</a> used in the calculation below
			to calculate the adjusted font size:

			<pre>c  =  ( a / a' ) s</pre>

			where:

			<pre>
			s  =  font-size value
			a  =  <a>aspect value</a> as specified by the 'font-size-adjust' property
			a' =  <a>aspect value</a> of actual font
			c  =  adjusted font-size to use
			</pre>

			Negative values are invalid.

			This value applies to any font that is selected
			but in typical usage it should be based on the <a>aspect value</a>
			of the first font in the font-family list.
			If this is specified accurately,
			the <code>(a/a')</code> term in the formula above
			is effectively 1 for the first font
			and no adjustment occurs.
			If the value is specified inaccurately,
			text rendered using the first font in the family list
			will display differently in older user agents

	</dl>

	The value of 'font-size-adjust' affects the used value of 'font-size'
	but does not affect the computed value.
	It affects the size of relative units
	that are based on font metrics
	such as <code>ex</code> and <code>ch</code>
	but does not affect the size of <code>em</code> units.
	Since numeric values of 'line-height'
	refer to the computed size of 'font-size',
	'font-size-adjust' does not affect the used value of 'line-height'.

	Note: In CSS, authors often specify 'line-height'
	as a multiple of the 'font-size'.
	Since the 'font-size-adjust' property affects the used value of 'font-size',
	authors should take care setting the line height
	when 'font-size-adjust' is used.
	Setting the line height too tightly can result in
	overlapping lines of text in this situation.


	<div class="example" id="ex-calc-aspect">
		Authors can calculate the <a>aspect value</a> for a given font
		by comparing spans with the same content
		but different 'font-size-adjust' properties.
		If the same font-size is used, the spans will match
		when the 'font-size-adjust' value is accurate for the given font.

		Two spans with borders are used to determine the <a>aspect value</a> of a font.
		The 'font-size' is the same for both spans
		but the 'font-size-adjust' property is specified only for the right span.
		Starting with a value of 0.5,
		the aspect value can be adjusted
		until the borders around the two letters line up.

		<pre>
		p {
			font-family: Futura;
			font-size: 500px;
		}

		span {
			border: solid 1px red;
		}

		.adjust {
			font-size-adjust: 0.5;
		}

		&lt;p>&lt;span>b&lt;/span>&lt;span class="adjust">b&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
		</pre>

		<figure>
			<img alt="Futura with an aspect value of 0.5" src="images/beforefontsizeadjust.png" >
			<figcaption>Futura with an <a>aspect value</a> of 0.5</figcaption>
		</figure>

		The box on the right is a bit bigger than the one on the left, so the <a>aspect value</a> of this font is something less than 0.5.
		Adjust the value until the boxes align.
	</div>

	The syntax of this property is based on a traditional
	typographical shorthand notation
	to set multiple properties related to fonts.
	For historical and backwards-compatibility reasons,
	it is <em>almost</em> a shorthand property.

	The 'font!!property' property is,
	except as described below,
	a shorthand property for setting
	'font-style!!property', 'font-variant!!property',
	'font-weight!!property', 'font-width!!property',
	'font-size!!property', 'line-height', 'font-family!!property'
	at the same place in the stylesheet.

	Values for the 'font-variant!!property' property can also be included
	but only those supported in CSS 2.1;
	none of the 'font-variant!!property' values added in
	CSS Fonts Levels 3 or 4
	can be used in the
	'font!!property' shorthand:

	<pre class="prod"><dfn id="font-variant-css21-values"><<font-variant-css2>></dfn>
		= normal | small-caps</pre>

	Values for the 'font-width!!property' property can also be included
	but only those supported in CSS Fonts level 3,
	none of the 'font-width!!property' values added in this specification
	can be used in the 'font' shorthand:

	<pre class="prod"><dfn id="font-width-css3-values"><<font-width-css3>></dfn>
		= normal | ultra-condensed | extra-condensed | condensed |
		  semi-condensed | semi-expanded | expanded | extra-expanded |
		  ultra-expanded</pre>

	Therefore we have the following classification
	of font-related properties
	and their interaction with the 'font!!property' property:

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn>Set Explicitly</dfn></dt>
		<dd><p>These properties may be set using the 'font!!property' property:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>'font-family!!property'</li>

				<li>'font-stretch!!property' (css3)</li>
				<li>'font-style!!property'</li>
				<li>'font-variant-caps!!property' (css2)</li>
				<li>'font-weight!!property'</li>
				<li>'line-height'</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt><dfn>Reset Implicitly</dfn></dt>
		<dd><p>These may not be set, but are reset to their initial values:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>'font-feature-settings!!property'</li>

				<li>'font-optical-sizing!!property'</li>

				<li>'font-variant-alternates!!property'</li>
				<li>'font-variant-caps!!property' (css3 and above)</li>
				<li>'font-variant-east-asian!!property'</li>
				<li>'font-variant-emoji!!property'</li>
				<li>'font-variant-ligatures!!property'</li>
				<li>'font-variant-numeric!!property'</li>
				<li>'font-variant-position!!property'</li>
				<li>'font-variation-settings!!property'</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt><dfn>Cascaded Independently</dfn></dt>
		<dd><p>There are neither set nor reset by the 'font!!property' property:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>'font-palette!!property'</li>
				<li>'font-synthesis-weight!!property'</li>
				<li>'font-synthesis-style!!property'</li>
				<li>'font-synthesis-small-caps!!property'</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
	</dl>

	All subproperties of the 'font!!property' property
	in the [=Set Explicitly=] and [=Reset Implicitly=] groups
	are first reset
	to their initial values.

	Then, those properties the [=Set Explicitly=] group
	that are given explicit values
	in the 'font!!property' shorthand
	are set to those values.
	For a definition of allowed and initial values,
	see the individual longhand property definitions.


	<div class="example" id="ex-font-shorthand">
		<pre>
		p { font: 12pt/14pt sans-serif }
		p { font: 80% sans-serif }
		p { font: x-large/110% &quot;new century schoolbook&quot;, serif }
		p { font: bold italic large Palatino, serif }
		p { font: normal small-caps 120%/120% fantasy }
		p { font: condensed oblique 12pt &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, serif; }
		p { font: condensed oblique 25deg 753 12pt &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, serif; }
		</pre>

		In the second rule, the font size percentage value ("80%")
		refers to the computed 'font-size' of the parent element.
		In the third rule, the line height percentage ("110%")
		refers to the font size of the element itself.

		The first three rules do not specify
		the 'font-variant!!property' and
		'font-weight!!property' explicitly,
		so these properties
		receive their initial values (''font-variant/normal'').
		Notice that the font family name ''"new century schoolbook"'',
		which contains spaces,
		is enclosed in quotes.
		The fourth rule sets the 'font-weight!!property' to ''bold'',
		the 'font-style!!property' to ''italic'',
		and implicitly sets 'font-variant!!property' to ''font-variant/normal''.

		The fifth rule sets the 'font-variant!!property' (''small-caps''),
		the 'font-size!!property' (120% of the parent's font size),
		the 'line-height!!property' (120% of the font size) and
		the 'font-family!!property' (''fantasy'').
		It follows that the keyword <css>normal</css>
		applies to the two remaining properties:
		'font-style!!property' and 'font-weight!!property'.

		The sixth rule sets the 'font-style!!property',
		'font-width!!property',
		'font-size!!property', and
		'font-family!!property',
		the other font properties being set to their initial values.

		The seventh rule sets 'font-style!!property' to ''oblique 25deg'',
		'font-weight!!property' to ''753'', and
		'font-width!!property' to ''condensed''.
		Note that the ''25deg'' in this rule must be
		immediately following the "oblique" keyword.
	</div>

	Since the 'font-width!!property' property was not defined in CSS 2.1,
	when using 'font-width!!property' values within 'font' rules,
	authors should include a extra version compatible with older user agents:

	<pre>
		p {
			font: 80% sans-serif;   /* for older user agents */
			font: condensed 80% sans-serif;
		}
	</pre>


	System fonts can only be set as a whole;
	that is, the font family, size, weight, style, etc.
	are all set at the same time.
	These values can then be altered individually if desired.
	If no font with the indicated characteristics exists
	on a given platform,
	the user agent should either intelligently substitute
	(e.g., a smaller version of the ''caption'' font might be used
	for the ''small-caption'' font),
	or substitute a user agent default font.
	As for regular fonts,
	if, for a system font, any of the individual properties
	are not part of the operating system's available user preferences,
	those properties
	should be set to their initial values.

	That is why this property is "almost" a shorthand property:
	system fonts can only be specified with this property,
	not with 'font-family!!property' itself,
	so 'font!!property'
	allows authors to do more than the
	sum of its subproperties.
	However, the individual properties
	such as 'font-weight!!property'
	are still given values
	taken from the system font,
	which can be independently varied.

	Note that the keywords used for the system fonts listed above
	are only treated as keywords
	when they occur in the initial position,
	in other positions the same string is treated
	as part of the font family name:

	<pre>
		font: menu;        /* use the font settings for system menus */
		font: large menu;  /* use a font family named "menu" */
	</pre>

	<div class="example" id="ex-menu-font">

		<pre>
		button { font: 300 italic 1.3em/1.7em &quot;FB Armada&quot;, sans-serif }
		button p { font: menu }
		button p em { font-weight: bolder }
		</pre>

		If the font used for dropdown menus
		on a particular system
		happened to be, for example,
		9-point Charcoal, with a weight of 600,
		then P elements that were descendants of BUTTON
		would be displayed as if
		this rule were in effect:

		<pre>button p { font: 600 9pt Charcoal }</pre>

		Because the 'font!!property' shorthand
		resets to its initial value
		any property not explicitly given a value,
		this has the same effect as
		this declaration:

		<pre>
		button p {
			font-style: normal;
			font-variant: normal;
			font-weight: 600;
			font-size: 9pt;
			line-height: normal;
			font-family: Charcoal
		}
		</pre>
	</div>

<h3 id="font-synthesis-intro">
Controlling synthetic faces</h3>

Synthetic font faces are a fallback strategy
to provide an approximation to the requested font
when a font family lacks a suitable face.

<div class="example" id="ex-synthesis-types">
	For example, a user agent might:

	* synthesize a bold face by drawing a thin stroke around each glyph
	* synthesize small-caps, superscripts, or subscripts by
		rendering regular glyphs at a smaller size and positioning them appropriately
	* synthesize an oblique face by geometrical shearing of each glyph
</div>

Synthesis is a fallback strategy
because the end result,
while perhaps better than nothing at all,
does not meet the level of quality
of a face designed for the purpose.

Variable fonts,
where the font designer has provided
one or more axes of variation
do <em>not</em> count as font synthesis
and their use is not affected by the 'font-synthesis' property.

Font Rendering Controls</h2>

<h3 id="font-rendering-controls-introduction">
Introduction to Font Rendering Controls</h3>

	When using downloadable Web Fonts via ''@font-face'',
	the user agent needs to know what to do while the font is actively loading.
	Most web browsers have adopted some form of timeout:

	<table class='data'>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Browser
				<th>Timeout
				<th>Fallback
				<th>Swap
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>Chrome 35+
				<td>3 seconds
				<td>yes
				<td>yes
			<tr>
				<th>Opera
				<td>3 seconds
				<td>yes
				<td>yes
			<tr>
				<th>Firefox
				<td>3 seconds
				<td>yes
				<td>yes
			<tr>
				<th>Internet Explorer
				<td>0 seconds
				<td>yes
				<td>yes
			<tr>
				<th>Safari
				<td>3 seconds
				<td>yes
				<td>yes
	</table>

	* Chrome and Firefox have a 3 second timeout after which the text is shown with the fallback font.
		Eventually, a swap occurs:
		the text is re-rendered with the intended font once it becomes available.
	* Internet Explorer has a 0 second timeout which results in immediate text rendering:
		if the requested font is not yet available,
		fallback is used,
		and text is rerendered later once the requested font becomes available.

	While these default behaviors are reasonable,
	they're unfortunately inconsistent across browsers.
	Worse, no single approach is sufficient to cover the range of use-cases
	required by modern user-experience&ndash; and performance&ndash;conscious applications.

	The Font Loading API [[CSS-FONT-LOADING-3]] allows a developer to override some of the above behaviors,
	but that requires scripting,
	a non-trivial amount of effort,
	and ultimately doesn't provide sufficient hooks to cover <em>all</em> reasonable cases.
	Additionally,
	the developer needs to either inline the loading script into their page
	or load an external library,
	introducing additional network latency before the fonts can be loaded
	and delaying text rendering.

	Design/performance-conscious web developers have a good sense
	for the relative importance of a given Web Font
	for the intended user experience.
	This specification provides them the ability to control
	font timeout and rendering behavior.
	Specifically, it lets developers:

	* Define the font display policy when
		text is ready to be painted:
		block, or paint with fallback.
	* Define the font display policy once
		the desired font is available:
		rerender text with the new font,
		or leave it with the fallback.
	* Define custom timeout values for each font.
	* Define custom display and timeout policies per element.

<h3 id="font-display-timeline">
The Font Display Timeline</h3>

	At the moment the user agent first attempts
	to use a given downloaded font face on a page,
	the font face's <dfn export local-lt="timer">font download timer</dfn> is started.
	This timer advances through three periods of time
	associated with the font face--
	the <a>block period</a>,
	the <a>swap period</a>, and
	the <a>failure period</a>--
	which dictate the rendering behavior of any elements using the font face:

	* The first period is the <dfn export local-lt="block period">font block period</dfn>.
		During this period,
		if the font face is not loaded,
		any element attempting to use it must instead
		<a>render with an invisible fallback font face</a>.
		If the font face successfully loads during the <a>block period</a>,
		the font face is then used normally.
	* The second period, occurring immediately after the <a>block period</a>,
		is the <dfn export local-lt="swap period">font swap period</dfn>.
		During this period,
		if the font face is not loaded,
		any element attempting to use it must instead
		<a>render with a fallback font face</a>.
		If the font face successfully loads during the <a>swap period</a>,
		the font face is then used normally.
	* The third period, occurring immediately after the <a>swap period</a>,
		is the <dfn export local-lt="failure period">font failure period</dfn>.
		If the font face is not yet loaded when this period starts,
		it's marked as a failed load,
		causing normal font fallback.
		Otherwise, the font face is used normally.

	To <dfn export>render with a fallback font face</dfn> for a given element,
	the user agent must find the first font face
	specified in the element's 'font-family!!property' list
	which is already loaded,
	and use that for rendering text.
	Doing this must not trigger loads of any of the fallback fonts.

	To <dfn export>render with an invisible fallback font face</dfn>
	for a given element,
	find a font face as per "<a>render with a fallback font face</a>".
	Create an anonymous font face
	with the same metrics as the selected font face
	but with all glyphs "invisible" (containing no "ink"),
	and use that for rendering text.
	Doing this must not trigger loads of any of the fallback fonts.

	<!-- Githubify issue -->
	Issue: ''fallback'' and ''optional'' can result in some faces in a family being used
	while others are required to fallback,
	giving a "ransom note" look.
	Perhaps require that all fonts in a family have the same behavior (all swapped in, or all fallback)?
	See also the @font-feature-values for controlling the behavior on a font family basis.

<h3 id="font-face-rule">
The <dfn id="at-font-face-rule">''@font-face''</dfn> rule</h3>

	The ''@font-face'' rule allows for linking to fonts
	that are automatically fetched and activated when needed.
	This allows authors to select a font
	that closely matches the design goals for a given page
	rather than limiting the font choice
	to a set of fonts available on a given platform.
	A set of font descriptors define the location of a font resource,
	either locally or externally,
	along with the style characteristics of an individual face.
	Multiple ''@font-face'' rules can be used to construct font families with a variety of faces.
	Using CSS font matching rules,
	a user agent can selectively download
	only those faces that are needed for a given piece of text.

	Its syntax is:

	<pre class=prod>
	@font-face {
		<<declaration-list>>
	}
	</pre>

	<wpt>
		downloadable-font-in-iframe-print.html
		downloadable-font-print.html
		variations/at-font-face-descriptors.html
	</wpt>

	The ''@font-face'' rule accepts the descriptors defined in this specification.

	Each ''@font-face''rule specifies a value for every font descriptor,
	either implicitly or explicitly.
	Those not given explicit values in the rule
	take the initial value listed with each descriptor in this specification.
	These descriptors apply solely within the context of the ''@font-face'' rule
	in which they are defined,
	and do not apply to document language elements.
	There is no notion of which elements the descriptors apply to
	or whether the values are inherited by child elements.
	When a given descriptor occurs multiple times in a given ''@font-face'' rule,
	only the last descriptor declaration is used
	and all prior declarations for that descriptor are ignored.

	<div class="example" id="ex-gentium">
		To use a downloadable font called Gentium:

		<pre>
		@font-face {
		font-family: Gentium;
		src: url(http://example.com/fonts/Gentium.woff);
		}

		p { font-family: Gentium, serif; }
		</pre>

		The user agent will download Gentium and use it when rendering text
		within paragraph elements.  If for some reason the site serving the font
		is unavailable, the default serif font will be used.
	</div>

	A given set of ''@font-face'' rules define a set of fonts
	available for use within the documents that contain these rules.
	When font matching is done, fonts defined using these rules
	are considered before other available fonts on a system.

	Downloaded fonts are only available to documents that reference them.
	The process of activating these fonts must not
	make them available to other applications
	or to documents that don't directly link to the same font.
	User agent implementers might consider it convenient
	to use downloaded fonts when rendering characters
	in other documents for which
	no other available font exists
	as part of the <em>installed font fallback</em> procedure.
	However, this would cause a security leak
	since the contents of one page would be able to affect other pages,
	something an attacker could use as an attack vector.
	These restrictions do not affect caching behavior,
	fonts are cached the same way other web resources are cached.

	<wpt>
		downloadable-font-scoped-to-document.html
		web-font-no-longer-accessible-when-stylesheet-removed.html
	</wpt>

	This at-rule follows the forward-compatible parsing rules of CSS.
	Like properties in a declaration block,
	declarations of any descriptors that are not supported by the user agent
	must be ignored.
	''@font-face'' rules require a font-family
	and src descriptor;
	if either of these are missing,
	the ''@font-face'' rule must not be considered
	when performing the <a href="#font-matching-algorithm">font matching algorithm</a>.

	In cases where user agents have limited platform resources
	or implement the ability to disable downloadable font resources,
	''@font-face'' rules must simply be ignored;
	the behavior of individual descriptors
	as defined in this specification
	should not be altered.

	<pre class='descdef'>

	</pre>

	This descriptor defines the font family name
	that will be used in all CSS font family name matching.
	It overrides the font family names
	contained in the underlying font data.
	If the font family name is the same
	as a font family available in a given user's environment,
	it effectively hides the underlying font
	for documents that use the stylesheet.
	This permits a web author to freely choose font-family names
	without worrying about conflicts with font family names
	present in a given user's environment.
	Likewise, platform substitutions
	for a given font family name
	must not be used.

	Name: src
	Value: <<font-src-list>>
	For: @font-face

	This descriptor specifies the resource containing font data.
	Its value is
	a prioritized,
	comma-separated list
	of external references
	or locally-installed font face names.
	When a font is needed
	the user agent iterates over the set of references listed,
	using the first one it can successfully parse and activate.
	Parsing this descriptor is more complicated than parsing other descriptors;
	see [[#font-face-src-parsing]] for the parsing rules.
	Activation of a font involves downloading the file
	or reading it from disk,
	parsing it,
	and perhaps additional user-agent-dependent steps.
	Fonts containing invalid data
	or local font faces
	that are not found
	are ignored
	and the user agent loads the next font in the list.

</wpt>

Note: The CSS WG does not anticipate extending this list of format strings in the future.

If a component value is parsed correctly
and is of a <a href="#font-format-definitions">font format</a> or
<a href="#font-tech-definitions">font tech</a>
that the UA supports,
add it to the list of supported sources.
If parsing a component value results in a parsing error
or its format or tech are unsupported,
do not add it to the list of supported sources.

If there are no supported entries at the end of this process,
the value for the 'src!!descriptor' descriptor is a parse error.

These parsing rules allow for graceful fallback of fonts
for user agents which don't support a particular font tech
or font format.

<div class="example" id="ex-incremental">
	For example,
	when incremental transfer is not supported,
	a woff2 compressed version of the font
	is supplied,
	for optimal performance.
	Then, for
	<a href="https://w3c.github.io/IFT/Overview.html">incremental transfer</a>,
	the raw uncompressed OpenType font is provided,
	portions of which will be loaded on demand.

	<pre>
	@font-face {
		font-family: "MyIncrementallyLoadedWebFont";
		src: url("FallbackURLForBrowsersWhichDontSupportIncrementalLoading.woff2") format("woff2");
		src: url("MyIncrementallyLoadedWebFont.otf") format(opentype)  tech(incremental);
	}
	</pre>
</div>


<h4 id="font-face-src-loading">Loading an individual item in the 'src!!descriptor' descriptor</h4>

	As with other URLs in CSS,
	the URL can be relative,
	in which case
	it is resolved relative to the location of the style sheet
	containing the ''@font-face'' rule.
	In the case of SVG fonts,
	the URL points to an element within a document
	containing SVG font definitions.
	If the element reference is omitted,
	a reference to the first defined font is implied.
	Similarly, font container formats
	that can contain more than one font
	must load one and only one of the fonts
	for a given ''@font-face'' rule.
	Fragment identifiers are used to indicate which font to load;
	these use the PostScript name of the font
	as defined in [[!RFC8081]].

<wpt>
	variations/font-opentype-collections.html
</wpt>

	Conformant user agents must not use a face
	from the resource
	unless its PostScript name exactly matches
	the fragment identifier,
	and must skip downloading the resource
	if the given fragment identifier
	cannot be a valid PostScript name.

	<div class="example" id="ex-load-font-fragment">
	<pre>
	src: url(fonts/simple.woff);       /* load simple.woff relative to stylesheet location */
	src: url(/fonts/simple.woff);      /* load simple.woff from absolute location */
	src: url(fonts/coll.otc#foo);      /* load font foo from collection coll.otc
	src: url(fonts/coll.woff2#foo);    /* load font foo from woff2 collection coll.woff2
	src: url(fonts.svg#simple);        /* load SVG font with id 'simple' */
	</pre>
	</div>

<h4 id="font-face-src-formats">Selecting items in the 'src!!descriptor'</h4>

	External references consist of a URL,
	followed by an optional hint
	describing the format of the font resource referenced by that URL.
	Conformant user agents
	must skip downloading a font resource
	if the format hint indicates an unsupported or unknown font format,
	or if any of the font technologies are unsupported by the user agent.
	If no format hint is supplied,
	the user agent should download the font resource.

	<div class="example" id="ex-woff2-woff1">
	For example, the following shows how to load a WOFF 2 font if possible,
	otherwise a WOFF 1,

<h5 id="local-font-fallback">Local font fallback</h5>

	When authors would prefer to use
	a locally available copy of a given font
	and download it if it's not,
	<code>local()</code> can be used.
	The locally-installed <<family-name>> argument to <code>local()</code>
	is a format-specific string
	that uniquely identifies a single font face
	within a larger family.
	The name can optionally be enclosed in quotes.
	If unquoted,
	the <a href="#family-name-syntax">unquoted font family name processing conventions</a> apply;
	in other words,
	the name must be a sequence of identifiers
	separated by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-syntax/#whitespace">whitespace</a>
	which is converted to a string
	by joining the identifiers together
	separated by a single space;
	and thus,
	<a>CSS-wide keywords</a> such as ''inherit'', and
	<<generic-family>> keywords such as ''serif''
	are not allowed inside <code>local()</code>.


	<pre  class="lang-css">
		/* regular face of Gentium */
		@font-face {
		font-family: MyGentium;
		src: local(Gentium),    /* prefer locally available Gentium */
			url(Gentium.woff);  /* otherwise, download it */
		}
	</pre>

	<div class="invalid example" id="ex-local-no-keywords">
	For example, this use of <code>local()</code> would be an error:

		<pre class="lang-css">
			@font-face {
				font-family: foo;
				src: local(inherit);
			}
		</pre>
	</div>

	For OpenType and TrueType fonts,
	this string is used to match only the Postscript name
	or the full font name
	in the name table of locally available fonts.
	Which type of name is used varies by platform
	and font,
	so authors should include both of these names
	to assure proper matching across platforms.
	Platform substitutions for a given font name must not be used.

	<pre>
		/* bold face of Gentium */
		@font-face {
		font-family: MyGentium;
		src: local(Gentium Bold),    /* full font name */
			local(Gentium-Bold),    /* Postscript name */
			url(GentiumBold.woff);  /* otherwise, download it */
		font-weight: bold;
		}
	</pre>

	Just as an ''@font-face'' rule specifies
	the characteristics of a single font
	within a family,
	the unique name used with <code>local()</code>
	specifies a single font,
	not an entire font family.
	Defined in terms of OpenType font data,
	the Postscript name is found in
	the font's
	<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm">name table</a>,
	in the name record with nameID = 6
	(see [[!OPENTYPE]] for more details).
	The Postscript name is the commonly used key for all fonts on OSX
	and for Postscript CFF fonts under Windows.
	The full font name (nameID = 4) is used as a unique key
	for fonts with TrueType glyphs on Windows.

	For OpenType fonts with multiple localizations of the full font name,
	the US English version must be used
	(language ID = 0x409 for Windows and language ID = 0 for Macintosh)
	or the first localization
	when a US English full font name is not available
	(the OpenType specification recommends that
	<a
	href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm">all fonts
	minimally include US English names</a>).
	User agents that also match other full font names,
	e.g. matching the Dutch name when the current system locale is set to Dutch,
	are considered non-conformant.

	Note: This is done,
	not to prefer English,
	but to avoid matching inconsistencies
	across font versions and OS localizations,
	since font style names (e.g. "Bold")
	are frequently localized into many languages
	and the set of localizations available
	varies widely across platform and font version.

	User agents that match a concatenation of
	family name (nameID = 1) with
	style name (nameID = 2)
	are considered non-conformant.

	Note: This also allows for referencing faces
	that belong to larger families
	that cannot otherwise be referenced.

	<div class="example" id="ex-local-font">
		Use a local font or reference an SVG font in another document:

		<pre>
		@font-face {
		font-family: Headline;
		src: local(Futura-Medium),
			url(images/fonts.svg#MyGeometricModern) format("svg");
		}
		</pre>

		Create an alias for local Japanese fonts on different platforms:

		<pre>
		@font-face {
		font-family: jpgothic;
		src: local(HiraKakuPro-W3), local(Meiryo), local(IPAPGothic);
		}
		</pre>

		Reference a font face that cannot be matched within a larger family:

		<pre>
		@font-face {
		font-family: Hoefler Text Ornaments;
		/* has the same font properties as Hoefler Text Regular */
		src: local(HoeflerText-Ornaments);
		}
		</pre>

		Since localized fullnames never match,
		a document with the header style rules below
		would always render using the default serif font,
		regardless whether a particular system locale parameter is set to Finnish or not:

		<pre>
		@font-face {
		font-family: SectionHeader;
		src: local("Arial Lihavoitu");  /* Finnish fullname for Arial Bold, should fail */
		font-weight: bold;
		}

		h2 { font-family: SectionHeader, serif; }
		</pre>

		A conformant user agent would never load the font 'gentium.eot'
		in the example below,
		since it is included in the first definition of the 'src!!descriptor' descriptor
		which is overridden by the second definition in the same ''@font-face'' rule:

		<pre>
		@font-face {
		font-family: MainText;
		src: url(gentium.eot);                     /* for use with older user agents */
		src: local("Gentium"), url(gentium.woff);  /* Overrides src definition */
		}
		</pre>

	These descriptors define the characteristics of a font face
	and are used in the process of matching styles to specific faces.
	For a font family defined with several ''@font-face'' rules,
	user agents can either download all faces in the family
	or use these descriptors to selectively download font faces that match actual styles used in document.
	The meaning of the values for these descriptors
	are the same as those for the corresponding font properties
	except that relative keywords are not allowed,
	''bolder'' and ''lighter''.
	If these descriptors are omitted,
	initial values are assumed.
	If specified values are out of range
	of the accepted values of the property of the same name,
	the descriptor is treated as a parse error.

	Ranges are accepted in these three descriptors in place of a single value.
	Where a single value is specified,
	it has the same meaning as a range with identical startpoint and endpoint.
	User agents must swap the computed value of the startpoint and endpoint of the range
	in order to forbid decreasing ranges.
	Both endpoints are inclusive.
	The ranges are used in the <a href="#font-matching-algorithm">Font Matching Algorithm</a> below.

	<wpt>
		font-face-range-order.html
		matching/range-descriptor-reversed.html
	</wpt>

	The auto values for these three descriptors have the following effects:

	- For font selection purposes, the font is selected as if
		the appropriate normal value
		(''font-style/normal'', ''font-weight/normal'' or ''font-width/normal'')
		is chosen
	- For variation axis clamping, clamping does not occur

	The value for these font face style attributes
	is used in place of the style implied by the underlying font data.
	This allows authors to combine faces in flexible combinations,
	even in situations where the original font data was arranged differently.
	User agents that implement synthetic bolding and obliquing
	must only apply synthetic styling in cases
	where the font descriptors imply this is needed,
	rather than based on the style attributes implied by the font data.
	However, variation values applied to fonts defined with '@font-face'
	will be clamped to both the values specified in these descriptors
	as well as the values supported by the font file itself.

	<div class="example" id="ex-descriptors-matching">
		The font descriptors defined in this section
		are used for selecting a font
		from within the set of fonts defined by ''@font-face'' rules for a given family.

		Consider a family containing a single, regular face:

		<pre>
		@font-face {
			font-family: BaskervilleSimple;
			src: url(baskerville-regular.woff2);
		}
		</pre>

		Unstyled text would display using the regular face
		defined in the ''@font-face'' rule:

		<figure><img alt="regular face display" src="images/fiddlesticks-regular.png" width="373" ></figure>

		However, italic text would display in most user agents
		using synthetically obliqued glyphs from the regular face,
		since a separate italic face is not defined:

		<figure><img alt="synthetic italics display" src="images/fiddlesticks-synitalics.png" width="373" ></figure>

		Now consider a family for which an actual italic face is defined:

		<pre>
		@font-face {
			font-family: BaskervilleFull;
			src: url(baskerville-regular.woff2);
		}

		@font-face {
			font-family: BaskervilleFull;
			src: url(baskerville-italic.woff2);
			font-style: italic;
		}
		</pre>

		The second ''@font-face'' rule
		defines the font resource <code>baskerville-italic.woff</code>
		to have style attributes of normal weight, normal stretch and italic style.
		When displaying italic text,
		the user agent will use this font,
		since it's the closest match for italic text.
		Thus, the text will display using glyphs designed by a type designer
		rather than using synthetically obliqued glyphs from the regular face:

		<figure><img alt="real italics display" src="images/fiddlesticks-italics.png" width="373" ></figure>

		See the section on <a href="#font-style-matching">font matching</a>
		for more complete details of the process used
		to select a particular face within a font family.
	</div>

	<div class="example" id="ex-descriptors-range">
		Fonts may advertise the range of 'font-weight!!property', 'font-width!!property', and 'font-style!!property' they are
		compatible with.
		<pre>
		@font-face {
			font-family: Lastima;
			src: url(lastima-varfont.woff2);
			font-weight: 100 399;
		}
		</pre>
		The above ''@font-face'' rule indicates that <code>lastima-varfont.woff</code> should be used when
		'font-weight!!property' is between 100 and 399. Depending on if there are any other ''@font-face'' rules which specify
		<code>font-family: Lastima</code>, <code>lastima-varfont.woff</code> might be used for values of 'font-weight!!property'
		outside of the 100 - 399 range. For more details, see the [[#font-matching-algorithm]].

		As <a href="#ex-descriptors-matching">above</a>, multiple ''@font-face'' rules may be joined together into a single
		family, spanning multiple ranges of 'font-weight!!property', 'font-width!!property', and/or 'font-style!!property':
		<pre>
		@font-face {
			font-family: Lastima;
			src: url(lastima-varfont-lightrange.woff2);
			font-weight: 100 399;
		}
		@font-face {
			font-family: Lastima;
			src: url(lastima-varfont-heavyrange.woff2);
			font-weight: 400 700;
		}
		</pre>
		The above ''@font-face'' rules indicate that <code>lastima-varfont-lightrange.woff</code> should be used when
		'font-weight!!property' is between 100 and 399, whereas </code>lastima-varfont-heavyrange.woff</code> should be used when
		'font-weight!!property' is between 400 and 700.

		Font width: the 'font-stretch!!descriptor' legacy name alias</h4>

	For historical reasons,
	a <dfn for="@font-face">font-stretch</dfn> descriptor exists

<h3 id="unicode-range-desc">
Character range: the 'unicode-range!!descriptor' descriptor</h3>

<pre class='descdef'>
Name: unicode-range
Value: <<urange>>#
Initial: U+0-10FFFF
For: @font-face
</pre>

<wpt>
	font-face-unicode-range-2.html
	font-face-unicode-range-nbsp.html
	font-face-unicode-range.html
</wpt>

This descriptor defines the set of Unicode codepoints that may be
supported by the font face for which it is declared. The descriptor
value is a comma-delimited list of Unicode range (<<urange>>)
values. The union of these ranges defines the set of codepoints that
serves as a hint for user agents when deciding whether or not to
download a font resource for a given text run.

Each <<urange>> value is a
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#tokenization"><code title="UNICODE-RANGE token">UNICODE-RANGE</code></a>
token made up of a "U+" or "u+" prefix
followed by a codepoint range in one of the three forms listed below.
Ranges that do not fit one of these forms are invalid
and cause the declaration to be ignored.

<dl>
	<dt>single codepoint (e.g. U+416)</dt>
	<dd>a Unicode codepoint, represented as one to six hexadecimal digits</dd>
	<dt>interval range (e.g. U+400-4ff)</dt>
	<dd>represented as two hyphen-separated Unicode codepoints
	indicating the inclusive start and end codepoints of a range</dd>
	<dt>wildcard range (e.g. U+4??)</dt>
	<dd>defined by the set of codepoints implied when
	  trailing '?' characters signify any hexadecimal digit</dd>
</dl>

Individual codepoints are written using hexadecimal values that correspond to
<a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/">Unicode character codepoints</a>.
Unicode codepoint values must be between 0 and 10FFFF inclusive. Digit
values of codepoints are <a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive">ASCII case-insensitive</a>. For interval ranges,
the start and end codepoints must be within the range noted above and
the end codepoint must be greater than or equal to the start
codepoint.

Wildcard ranges specified with ‘?’ that lack an
initial digit (e.g. "U+???") are valid and equivalent
to a wildcard range with an initial zero digit (e.g. "U+0???" = "U+0000-0FFF").
Wildcard ranges that extend beyond the range of
Unicode codepoints are invalid. Because of this, the maximum
number of trailing '?' wildcard characters is five, even though the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#tokenization"><code title="UNICODE-RANGE token">UNICODE-RANGE</code></a>
token accepts six.

Within the comma-delimited list of Unicode ranges in a
'unicode-range!!descriptor' descriptor declaration, ranges may overlap. The union
of these ranges defines the set of codepoints for which the
corresponding font may be used. User agents must not download or use
the font for codepoints outside this set. User agents may normalize
the list of ranges into a list that is different but represents the
same set of codepoints.

The associated font might not contain glyphs for the entire set of
codepoints defined by the 'unicode-range!!descriptor' descriptor. When the font
is used, the <dfn>effective character map</dfn> is the intersection of the
codepoints defined by 'unicode-range!!descriptor' with the font's <a>character map</a>.
This allows authors to define supported ranges in terms of broad
ranges without worrying about the precise codepoint ranges supported
by the underlying font.

<h4 id="composite-fonts">Using character ranges to define composite fonts</h4>

Multiple ''@font-face'' rules with different unicode ranges for the same
family and style descriptor values can be used to create composite fonts
that mix the glyphs from different fonts for different scripts. This
can be used to combine fonts that only contain glyphs for a single
script (e.g. Latin, Greek, Cyrillic) or it can be used by authors as a
way of segmenting a font into fonts for commonly used characters and
less frequently used characters. Since the user agent will only pull
down the fonts it needs this helps reduce page bandwidth.

If the unicode ranges overlap for a set of ''@font-face'' rules with the
same family and style descriptor values, the rules are ordered in the
reverse order they were defined; the last rule defined is the first to
be checked for a given character.

Example ranges for specific languages or characters:

<dl>
	<dt>unicode-range: U+A5;</dt>
	<dd>a single code point, the yen/yuan symbol</dd>

	<dt>unicode-range: U+0-7F;</dt>
	<dd>code range for basic ASCII characters</dd>

	<dt>unicode-range: U+590-5ff;</dt>
	<dd>code range for Hebrew characters</dd>

	<dt>unicode-range: U+A5, U+4E00-9FFF, U+30??, U+FF00-FF9F;</dt>
	<dd>code range for Japanese kanji, hiragana and katakana characters plus yen/yuan symbol</dd>
</dl>

<div class="example" id="ex-urange-bengali">
	The BBC provides news services in a wide variety of languages, many
	that are not well supported across all platforms. Using an ''@font-face''
	rule, the BBC could provide a font for any of these languages, as it
	already does via a manual font download.</p>
<pre>
@font-face {
	font-family: BBCBengali;
	src: url(fonts/BBCBengali.woff) format("woff");
	unicode-range: U+00-FF, U+980-9FF;
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example" id="ex-stix">
	Technical documents often require a wide range of symbols.  The STIX
	Fonts project is one project aimed at providing fonts to support a wide
	range of technical typesetting in a standardized way.  The example below
	shows the use of a font that provides glyphs for many of the
	mathematical and technical symbol ranges within Unicode:
<pre>
@font-face {
	font-family: STIXGeneral;
	src: local(STIXGeneral), url(/stixfonts/STIXGeneral.otf);
	unicode-range: U+000-49F, U+2000-27FF, U+2900-2BFF, U+1D400-1D7FF;
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example" id="ex-better-latin">
	This example shows how an author can override the glyphs used for
	Latin characters in a Japanese font with glyphs from a different font.
	The first rule specifies no range so it defaults to the entire range.
	The range specified in the second rule overlaps but takes precedence
	because it is defined later.

<pre>
@font-face {
	font-family: JapaneseWithGentium;
	src: local(MSMincho);
	/* no range specified, defaults to entire range */
}

@font-face {
	font-family: JapaneseWithGentium;
	src: url(../fonts/Gentium.woff);
	unicode-range: U+0-2FF;
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example" id="ex-subset-ftw">
	Consider a family constructed to optimize bandwidth by separating out
	Latin, Japanese and other characters into different font files:

<pre>
/* fallback font - size: 4.5MB */
@font-face {
	font-family: DroidSans;
	src: url(DroidSansFallback.woff);
	/* no range specified, defaults to entire range */
}

/* Japanese glyphs - size: 1.2MB */
@font-face {
	font-family: DroidSans;
	src: url(DroidSansJapanese.woff);
	unicode-range: U+3000-9FFF, U+ff??;
}

/* Latin, Greek, Cyrillic along with some
	punctuation and symbols - size: 190KB */
@font-face {
	font-family: DroidSans;
	src: url(DroidSans.woff);
	unicode-range: U+000-5FF, U+1e00-1fff, U+2000-2300;
}
</pre>

	For simple Latin text, only the font for Latin characters is downloaded:

<pre>
body { font-family: DroidSans; }

&lt;p>This is that&lt;/p>
</pre>

	In this case the user agent first checks the unicode-range for the
	font containing Latin characters (DroidSans.woff).  Since all the
	characters above are in the range U+0-5FF, the user agent downloads the
	font and renders the text with that font.

	Next, consider text that makes use of an arrow character (&#x21e8;):

<pre>
&lt;p>This &amp;#x21e8; that&lt;p>
</pre>

	The user agent again first checks the unicode-range of the font
	containing Latin characters. Since U+2000-2300 includes the arrow
	code point (U+21E8), the user agent downloads the font. For this
	character however the Latin font does not have a matching glyph, so the
	effective unicode-range used for font matching excludes this code point.
	Next, the user agent evaluates the Japanese font. The unicode-range for
	the Japanese font, U+3000-9FFF and U+ff??, does not include U+21E8, so
	the user agent does not download the Japanese font.
	Next the fallback font is considered. The ''@font-face'' rule for the
	fallback font does not define unicode-range so its value defaults to
	the range of all Unicode code points. The fallback font is downloaded and
	used to render the arrow character.

These descriptors define initial settings that apply when the font defined by
an ''@font-face'' rule is rendered.  They do not affect font selection.
Values are identical to those defined for the corresponding
'font-feature-settings!!property' and
'font-variation-settings!!property' properties defined below
except that the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> are omitted. When multiple font
feature descriptors, properties, or variations are used, optionally along with a named instance,
the cumulative effect on
text rendering is detailed in the section
[[#font-feature-variation-resolution]] below.

These descriptors set features and variation values
on the font object which the ''@font-face'' rule represents,
rather than on an entire element.
Therefore, when using these descriptors,
only some glyphs in an element may be rendered with that feature,
due to [[#cluster-matching]].

<div class="example" id="ex-grotesque-XHGT">
For example, the following ''@font-face'' block will
apply the instance named "Grotesque"
but will override the "XHGT" axis to have a value of 0.7.

<pre>
@font-face {
	font-family: "AccuroVar";

	font-named-instance: "Grotesque";
	font-variation-settings: "XHGT" 0.7;

Note: Because the variation axis values supplied in the
	'font-weight!!property', 'font-width!!property', and 'font-style!!property' properties
	are applied before
	the value in the 'font-named-instance!!descriptor' descriptor,
	there is no need to change the value of those properties
	when a named instance is desired.

<h3 id="font-requests">Font request guidelines</h3>

<h4 id="font-face-loading">Font loading guidelines</h4>

The ''@font-face'' rule is designed to allow lazy loading
of font resources that are only downloaded when used within a
document. A stylesheet can include ''@font-face'' rules for
a library of fonts of which only a select set are used; user agents
must only download those fonts that are referred to within the style
rules applicable to a given page. User agents that download all fonts
defined in ''@font-face'' rules without considering whether
those fonts are in fact used within a page are considered
non-conformant. In cases where a font might be downloaded in character
fallback cases, user agents may download a font if it's contained within
the computed value of 'font-family!!property'
for a given text run.

<pre>
@font-face {
	font-family: GeometricModern;
	src: url(font.woff);
}

p {
	/* font will be downloaded for pages with p elements */
	font-family: GeometricModern, sans-serif;
}

h2 {
	/* font may be downloaded for pages with h2 elements, even if Futura is available locally */
	font-family: Futura, GeometricModern, sans-serif;
}
</pre>

In cases where textual content is loaded before downloadable fonts are available,
user agents must render text according to the '@font-face/font-display' descriptor of that ''@font-face'' block.
In cases where the font download fails, user agents must
display the text visibly. Authors are advised to use fallback fonts in
their font lists that closely match the metrics of the
downloadable fonts to avoid large page reflows where possible.

<h3 id="font-display-desc">
Controlling Font Display Per Font-Face: the 'font-display!!descriptor' descriptor</h3>

The '@font-face/font-display' descriptor for ''@font-face''
determines how a font face is displayed,
based on whether and when it is downloaded and ready to use.

<pre class='descdef'>
Name: font-display
Value: auto | block | swap | fallback | optional
Initial: auto
For: @font-face
</pre>

<wpt>
	font-display/font-display-change.html
	font-display/font-display-failure-fallback.html
	font-display/font-display-preload.html
	font-display/font-display.html
</wpt>

Note: For all of these values,
user agents may use slightly different durations,
or more sophisticated behaviors that can't be directly expressed in the '@font-face/font-display' syntax,
in order to provide more useful behavior for their users.
They may also provide the ability for users to override author-chosen behavior
with something more desirable;
for example, forcing all fonts to have a ''0s'' <a>block period</a>.

<dl dfn-type="value" dfn-for="@font-face/font-display">
	<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
	<dd>
		The font display policy is user-agent-defined.

		Note: Many browsers have a default policy similar to that specified by ''display/block''.

	<dt><dfn>block</dfn>
	<dd>
		Gives the font face a short <a>block period</a>
		(''3s'' is recommended in most cases)
		and an infinite <a>swap period</a>.

		Note: In other words, the browser draws "invisible" text at first if it's not loaded,
		but swaps the font face in as soon as it loads.

		This value must only be used when rendering text in a particular font is required for the page to be usable.
		It must only be used for small pieces of text.

		<div class="example" id="ex-bad-icon-fonts">
			For example, badly designed "icon fonts" might associate a "⎙" (printer) icon
			with an unrelated character like "P",
			so if the text is displayed with a fallback font instead
			there will be confusing letters scattered around the page
			rather than the desired icon.
			In this case, temporary blank spots are better than using a fallback font.

			(However, the fallback font is used <em>eventually</em>,
			as having confusing letters scattered around the page
			is better than having links and such never show up at all.)

			A better solution is described in the
			<a href="#a11y">Accessibility Considerations</a> section.
		</div>

	<dt><dfn>swap</dfn>
	<dd>
		Gives the font face an extremely small <a>block period</a>
		(''100ms'' or less is recommended in most cases)
		and an infinite <a>swap period</a>.

		Note: In other words, the browser draws the text immediately with a fallback if the font face isn't loaded,
		but swaps the font face in as soon as it loads.

		This value should only be used when rendering text in a particular font is very important for the page,
		but rendering in any font will still get a correct message across.
		It should only be used for small pieces of text.

		<div class='example' id="ex-logo-font">
			For example,
			if a website has a custom font for rendering their logo,
			rendering that logo correctly is fairly important for branding purposes,
			but displaying the logo in any font will at least get the point across without confusion.
		</div>

	<dt><dfn>fallback</dfn>
	<dd>
		Gives the font face an extremely small <a>block period</a>
		(''100ms'' or less is recommended in most cases)
		and a short <a>swap period</a>
		(''3s'' is recommended in most cases).

		Note: In other words, the font face is rendered with a fallback at first if it's not loaded,
		but it's swapped in as soon as it loads.
		However, if too much time passes,
		the fallback will be used for the rest of the page's lifetime instead.

		This value should be used for body text,
		or any other text where the use of the chosen font is useful and desired,
		but it's acceptable for the user to see the text in a fallback font.
		This value is appropriate to use for large pieces of text.

		<div class="example" id="ex-avoid-shifting">
			For example,
			in large pieces of body text,
			it's most important just to get the text rendered quickly,
			so the user can begin to read as quickly as possible.
			Further, once the user has started reading,
			they shouldn't be disturbed by the text suddenly "shifting"
			as a new font is swapped in,
			as that's distracting and annoying to re-find where one was in the text.
		</div>

	<dt><dfn>optional</dfn>
	<dd>
		If the font can be loaded "immediately"
		(such that it's available to be used for the "first paint" of the text),
		the font is used.

		Otherwise, the font is treated
		as if its [=block period=] and [=swap period=] both expired before it finished loading.
		If the font is not used due to this,
		the user agent may choose to abort the font download,
		or download it with a very low priority.
		If the user agent believes it would be useful for the user,
		it may avoid even starting the font download,
		and proceed immediately to using a fallback font.

		An ''optional'' font <strong>must never</strong>
		cause the layout of the page to "jump" as it loads in.
		A user agent <em>may</em> choose to slightly delay rendering an element using an optional font
		to give it time to load from a possibly-slow local cache,
		but once the text has been painted to the screen with a fallback font instead,
		it must not be rendered with the ''optional'' font for the rest of the page's lifetime.

		This value should be used for body text,
		or any other text where the chosen font is purely a decorative "nice-to-have".
		It should be used anytime it is more important that the web page render quickly on first visit,
		than it is that the user wait a longer time to see everything perfect immediately.

		<div class='example' id="ex-perfectly-readable">
			For example, body text is perfectly readable in one of the browser default fonts,
			though a downloadable font face might be more attractive
			and mesh with the site's aesthetics better.
			First time visitors to a site generally care far more about the site being quickly usable
			than they do about the finer points of its display,
			and ''optional'' provides a good behavior for them.
			If they return later,
			the desired font faces might have finished downloading,
			giving them the "intended" experience without slowing down
			either their first or subsequent visits.

			Users on very slow connections might not ever receive the "intended" experience,
			but ''optional'' ensures they can actually <em>use</em> the site,
			rather than quitting and going elsewhere because the site takes too long to load.
		</div>

		<div class=note>
			To increase the chance that an ''optional'' font will be available
			in time to use for rendering some text,
			it is recommended that the user agent employ heuristics
	        to make it faster to access
	        or to judge when it would be worthwhile to delay rendering some text,
			such as checking if the font is preloaded in HTML,
			or moving the file from slower to faster in-memory caches
			as soon as it is seen in a stylesheet
			(before it's known whether it will be used on the page).

			These heuristics cannot be relied upon by authors, however;
			it must be understood that the ''optional'' value
			can result in the font never being used.
			If a somewhat higher assurance of the font being used is needed,
			authors should consider using the ''fallback'' value.

<h4 id="font-display-font-feature-values">
Controlling Font Display Per Font-Family via ''@font-feature-values''</h4>

The '@font-feature-values/font-display' descriptor for ''@font-feature-values''
determines how a font family is displayed,
by setting the "default" font-display value
for ''@font-face'' rules targeting the same font family.
When '@font-face/font-display!!descriptor' is omitted in an ''@font-face'' rule,
the user agent uses the '@font-feature-values/font-display!!descriptor' value
set via ''@font-feature-values'' for the relevant font-family if one is set,
and otherwise defaults to ''font-display: auto''.

This mechanism can be used to set a default display policy for an entire font-family,
and enables developers to set a display policy for ''@font-face'' rules
that are not directly under their control.
For example, when a font is served by a third-party font foundry,
the developer does not control the ''@font-face'' rules
but is still able to set a default font-display policy for the provided font-family.
The ability to set a default policy for an entire font-family
is also useful to avoid the ransom note effect
(i.e. mismatched font faces)
because the display policy is then applied to the entire font family.

<h2 id="font-matching-algorithm">Font Matching Algorithm</h2>

The algorithm below describes how fonts are associated with individual runs of text.
For each character in the run
a font family is chosen
and a particular font face is selected
containing a glyph for that character.

The set of  <a href="#installed-fonts">installed fonts</a> available
to the Font Matching Algorithm
is explicitly undefined.

The default set of installed fonts will vary
by UA, platform, and locale;
it is important that users be able to customise
which installed fonts are available for rendering web pages
and to which generic font families, if any,
these fonts are mapped.

UAs may choose to expose all installed fonts to the web,
regardless of how that font was installed;
doing so is likely to have good internationalization properties
for users whose primary language is not supported
by fonts shipping with their operating system.

UAs may alternatively choose
to not initially expose any user-installed fonts to aid privacy on the web;
for the set of installed fonts a user has installed
is often used as a tracking vector to track users across the web.
Users would then add to add to or remove fonts from that set,
according to their needs.

UAs may choose a hybrid approach, where some user-installed fonts
are initially exposed for internationalization,
but others aren't.
Again, users would be able to customise this starting set.

UAs are expected to make informed decisions
on which fonts they expose to the web by default,
so as to balance between internationalization and privacy.
UAs are expected to also provide a convenient means
for users to add and subtract fonts
to meet their particular needs.

<h3 id="localized-name-matching">Localized name matching</h3>

	Some font file formats allow
	font faces to carry multiple localizations
	of a particular string
	(e.g. family name or named instance).
	User agents must recognize and correctly match all of these names
	independent of the underlying platform localization,
	system API used, or document encoding.

	<div class="example" id="ex-localized-name">
	    For example,
	    for each of the fonts listed below,
	    the author can use either the Latin name
	    or the localized name
	    in the 'font-family!!property' property,
	    and the results will be identical on all systems:
	    <figure>
	        <img alt="examples of localized family names" src="images/localizedfamilynames.png" >
	        <figcaption>Localized family names</figcaption>
	    </figure>
	</div>

User agents must match these names case insensitively,
using the "Default Caseless Matching" algorithm outlined in the Unicode specification [[!UNICODE]].
This algorithm is detailed in section 3.13 entitled "Default Case Algorithms".
Specifically, the algorithm must be applied
without normalizing the strings involved
and without applying any language-specific tailorings.
The case folding method specified by this algorithm
uses the case mappings with status field "C" or "F"
in the CaseFolding.txt file of the Unicode Character Database.

Note: For authors this means that font family names are matched case insensitively,
whether those names exist in a platform font
or in the ''@font-face'' rules contained in a stylesheet.
Authors should take care to ensure that names
use a character sequence consistent with the actual font family name,
particularly when using combining characters such as diacritical marks.
For example, a family name that contains a lowercase a (U+0061)
followed by a combining ring (U+030A)
will <strong>not</strong> match a name that looks identical
but which uses the precomposed lowercase a-ring character (U+00E5)
instead of the combining sequence.

Note: Implementors should take care to verify that a given caseless string comparison implementation
uses this precise algorithm
and not assume that a given platform string matching routine follows it,
as many of these have locale-specific behavior
or use some level of string normalization.

<h3 id="font-style-matching">Matching font styles</h3>

The procedure for choosing a font
for a given character in a run of text
consists of iterating over the font families named by the 'font-family!!property' property,
selecting a font face with the appropriate style
based on other font properties
and then determining whether a glyph exists for the given character.
This is done using the <dfn>character map</dfn> of the font,
data which maps characters to the default glyph for that character.
A font is considered to <dfn>support</dfn> a given character if
(1) the character is contained in the font's <a>character map</a> and
(2) if required by the containing script, shaping information is available for that character.

Some legacy fonts might include a given character in the <a>character map</a>
but lack the shaping information
(e.g. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/ttochap1.htm">OpenType layout tables</a>
or <a href="https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=projects&amp;item_id=graphite_techAbout">Graphite tables</a>)
necessary for correctly rendering text runs containing that character.

Codepoint sequences consisting of a base character
followed by a sequence of combining characters
are treated slightly differently,
see the section on <a href="#cluster-matching">cluster matching</a> below.

For this procedure,
the <dfn>default face</dfn> for a given font family
is defined to be the face that would be selected
if all font style properties were set to their initial value.

<ol id="fontmatchingalg">
	1. Using the computed font property values for a given element,
		the user agent starts with the first family name
		specified by the 'font-family!!property' property.

	2. If the family name is a generic family keyword, the user agent
		looks up the appropriate font family name to be used.  User
		agents may choose the generic font family to use based on the
		language of the containing element or the Unicode range of the
		character.

	3. For other family names, the user agent attempts to find the
		family name among fonts defined via ''@font-face'' rules and then
		among available installed fonts
		(this may include font aliases),
		matching names with a
		[[#localized-name-matching]] as outlined
		in the section above.
		If the font
		resources defined for a given face in an ''@font-face'' rule are either
		not available or contain invalid font data, then the face should be
		treated as not present in the family. If no faces are present for a
		family defined via ''@font-face'' rules, the family should be treated as
		missing; matching a platform font with the same name must not occur
		in this case.

	4. If a font family match occurs, the user agent assembles the set
		of font faces in that family and then narrows the set to a single
		face using other font properties in the order given below. Fonts might be
		present in this group which can support a range of
		'font-width!!property', 'font-style!!property', or 'font-weight!!property' properties. In
		this case, the algorithm proceeds as if each supported combination of
		values is a unique font in the set. If such a font is ultimately
		selected by this algorithm, particular values for
		'font-width!!property', 'font-style!!property', and 'font-weight!!property' must be applied
		before any layout or rendering occurs. The application of these values
		must be applied in the <a href="#apply-font-matching-variations">Apply
		font matching variations</a> step detailed in
		[[#font-feature-variation-resolution]].
		A group
		of faces defined via ''@font-face'' rules with identical font
		descriptor values but differing 'unicode-range!!descriptor' values are considered to be
		a single <dfn>composite face</dfn> for this step:

		<wpt>
			matching/fixed-stretch-style-over-weight.html
			matching/stretch-distance-over-weight-distance.html
			matching/style-ranges-over-weight-direction.html
		</wpt>

		<ol id="fontstylematchingalg">
			1. 'font-width!!property' is tried first. If a font
				does not have any concept of varying strengths of width values, its width value
				is mapped according table in the <a href="#widthmappings">property definition</a>.
				If the matching set includes faces with width values
				containing the 'font-width!!property' desired value, faces with width values which do not include the desired width value
				are removed from the matching set. If there is no face
				which contains the desired value, a width value is chosen using the rules below:

				* If the desired width value is less than or equal to 100%, width values below the
					desired width value are checked in descending order followed by
					width values above the desired width value in ascending order until a
					match is found.
				* Otherwise, width values above the
					desired width value are checked in ascending order followed by
					width values below the desired width value in descending order until a
					match is found.

				Once the
				closest matching width has been determined by this process,
				faces with widths which do not include this determined width are removed from the matching set.

				<div class="example" id="ex-ascending-stretch">
					This search algorithm can be thought of as a distance function, where the lowest-distance value present in the font family is selected, and all fonts not including that value are eliminated.

					Consider a font family with three fonts, named A, B, and C, each with associated supported ranges for the 'font-width!!property' descriptor. If an element is styled with "font-width: 125%", the search algorithm can be visualized as follows:

					<img src="images/stretchdistance.svg" alt="algorithm">

					The font width ranges supported by fonts A, B, and C are shown in the graph above. As you can see, because font B contains the minimum width value across the entire family, font B would be selected by this algorithm. However, if font B were somehow eliminated from the family, font C would then contain the lowest distance in the family, so it would be selected.
				</div>

				<div class="example" id="ex-ascending-stretch-2">
					Similar to the <a href="#ex-ascending-stretch">previous example</a>, here is the conceptual distance graph for an element styled with "font-width: 75%":

					<img src="images/stretchdistance2.svg" alt="distance graph">

					As you can see, because font B contains the minimum width value across the entire family, font B would be selected by this algorithm. However, if font B were somehow eliminated from the family, font A would then contain the lowest distance in the family, so it would be selected.
				</div>

			2. 'font-style!!property' is tried next
				(see [[#font-style-matching]]).
				If a font does not have any concept of varying strengths of italics or oblique angles, its style
				is mapped according to the description in the 'font-style!!property' property definition.

				If the value of 'font-style!!property' is ''italic'':

				1. If the matching set includes faces with italic values containing the mapped value of ''italic'',
					then faces with italic values which do not include the desired italic mapped value are removed from the matching set.
				2. Otherwise, italic values above the desired italic value are checked in ascending order followed by
					italic values below the desired italic value, until 0 is hit. Only positive values of italic values are checked
					in this stage.
				3. If no match is found, oblique values greater than or equal to 11deg are checked in ascending order
					followed by oblique values below 11deg in descending order, until 0 is hit. Only positive values of oblique values
					are checked in this stage.

					ISSUE: The threshold for preferring oblique over normal <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2295">should be lower than the average angle</a>.

				4. If no match is found, italic values less than or equal to 0 are checked in descending order until a match is found.
				5. If no match is found, oblique values less than or equal to 0deg are checked in descending order until a match is found.

					<div class="example" id="ex-ascending-italic">

						As you can see, because font D contains the minimum italic value across the entire family, font D would be selected by this algorithm. However, if font D were somehow eliminated from the family, font E would then contain the lowest distance in the family, so it would be selected. If E were eliminated, C would be selected. If C were eliminated, font B would not be chosen immediately; instead, oblique values would be consulted and an oblique value might be chosen. However, if no oblique value is chosen, font B would then be selected, followed by font A.

				If the value of 'font-style!!property' is ''oblique'' and the requested angle is greater than or equal to 11deg,

				<ol id="greater-oblique-steps">
					1. If the matching set includes faces with oblique values containing the value of ''oblique'',

						oblique values below the desired oblique value, until 0 is hit. Only positive values of oblique values are checked in this stage.

				1. Oblique values greater than or equal to 0 are checked in ascending order.
				2. If no match is found, italic values greater than or equal to 0 are checked in ascending
				3. If no match is found, oblique values less than 0deg are checked in descending order until a match is found.
				4. If no match is found, italic values less than 0 are checked in descending order until a match is found.

However, if no italic value is chosen, font B would then be selected, followed by font A.
				</div>

				If an oblique angle was found in the above search, all faces which don't include that oblique angle are excluded from the matching set. Otherwise, if an italic value was found in the above search, all faces which don't include that italic value are excluded from the matching set.

				User agents are not required to distinguish between italic and oblique fonts. In such user agents, the 'font-style!!property' matching steps above are performed by mapping both italic values and oblique angles onto a common scale. The exact nature of this mapping is undefined, however, an italic value of 1 must map to the same value that an oblique angle of 11deg maps to. Within font
				families defined via ''@font-face'' rules, italic and oblique
				faces must be distinguished using the value of the
				'font-style!!descriptor' descriptor.

				For families that lack any italic or oblique faces, user agents
				may create artificial oblique faces, if this is permitted by the
				value of the 'font-synthesis' property.


			3. 'font-weight!!property' is matched next. If a font does not have any concept of varying strengths of weights, its weight is mapped according list in the <a href="#font-weight-numeric-values">property definition</a>. If bolder/lighter relative weights are used, the effective weight is calculated based on the inherited weight value, as described in the definition of the 'font-weight!!property' property. If the matching set after performing the steps above includes faces with weight values containing the font-weight desired value, faces with weight values which do not include the desired font-weight value are removed from the matching set. If there is no face which contains the desired value, a weight value is chosen using the rules below:

				* If the desired weight is inclusively between 400 and 500, weights greater than or equal to the target weight are checked in ascending order until 500 is hit and checked, followed by weights less than the target weight in descending order, followed by weights greater than 500, until a match is found.
				* If the desired weight is less than 400, weights less than or equal to the
					desired weight are checked in descending order followed by
					weights above the desired weight in ascending order until a
					match is found.
				* If the desired weight is greater than 500, weights greater than or equal to the
					desired weight are checked in ascending order followed by
					weights below the desired weight in descending order until a
					match is found.

				<div class="example" id="ex-weight-400">
					Similar to the <a href="#ex-ascending-stretch">previous example</a>, here is the conceptual distance graph for an element styled with "font-weight: 400":

					<img src="images/styleweight.svg" alt="distance graph">

					As you can see, because font B contains the minimum distance across the entire family, font B would be selected by this algorithm. However, if font B were somehow eliminated from the family, font C would then contain the lowest distance in the family, so it would be selected. If C were eliminated, D would be selected, followed by fonts A and then E.
				</div>

				<div class="example" id="ex-weight-450">
					Similar to the <a href="#ex-ascending-stretch">previous example</a>, here is the conceptual distance graph for an element styled with "font-weight: 450":

					<img src="images/styleweight450.svg" alt="distance graph">

					As you can see, because font C contains the minimum distance across the entire family, font C would be selected by this algorithm. However, if font C were somehow eliminated from the family, font D would then contain the lowest distance in the family, so it would be selected. If D were also eliminated, B would be selected, followed by fonts A and then E.
				</div>

				<div class="example" id="ex-weight-500">
					Similar to the <a href="#ex-ascending-stretch">previous example</a>, here is the conceptual distance graph for an element styled with "font-weight: 500":

					<img src="images/weightmatching.svg" alt="distance graph">

					As you can see, because font D contains the minimum distance across the entire family, font D would be selected by this algorithm. However, if font D were somehow eliminated from the family, font B would then contain the lowest distance in the family, so it would be selected. If B were eliminated, C would be selected, followed by fonts B, A, and then E.
				</div>

				<div class="example" id="ex-weight-300">
					Similar to the <a href="#ex-ascending-stretch">previous example</a>, here is the conceptual distance graph for an element styled with "font-weight: 300":

					<img src="images/weightmatching2.svg" alt="distance graph">

					As you can see, because font B contains the minimum distance across the entire family, font B would be selected by this algorithm. However, if font B were somehow eliminated from the family, font A would then contain the lowest distance in the family, so it would be selected. If A were eliminated, C would be selected.
				</div>

				Once the closest matching weight has been determined by this process,
				faces with weights which do not include this determined weight are removed from the matching set.

	            Note: There is a small behavior change between [[CSS-FONTS-3]] and this specification
	            with the animation of the 'font-weight!!property' property.
	            Previously, interpolated values of font-weight were rounded to their closest multiple of 100,
	            and the font-matching algorithm was run on these rounded values.
	            In this specification, the font-matching algorithm is able to accept any value,
	            so no rounding occurs.
	            The small behavior change is due to the discontinuous nature of the font-matching algorithm.

			4. 'font-size' must be
				matched within a UA-dependent margin of tolerance. (Typically, sizes
				for scalable fonts are rounded to the nearest whole pixel, while the
				tolerance for bitmapped fonts could be as large as 20%.) Further
				computations, e.g., by ''em'' values in other properties, are based on
				the 'font-size' value that
				is used, not the one that is specified.
		</ol>

		Note that more than one font might be remaining in the matching set after performing
		the above steps. If so, the user agent must choose a single font from
		the matching set and continue these steps with it. The choice of which
		font to choose can differ between multiple user agents and multiple operating
		system platforms; however, it must not differ between two elements in the same document.

	5. If the matched face is defined via ''@font-face''
		rules, user agents must use the procedure below to select a single
		font:

		1. If the font resource has not been loaded and the range of
			characters defined by the 'unicode-range!!descriptor' descriptor value
			includes the character in question, load the font.
		2. After downloading, if the <em>effective character map</em>
			supports the character in question, select that font.

		When the matched face is a <em>composite face</em>, user agents must use
		the procedure above on each of the faces in the <em>composite face</em> in
		reverse order of ''@font-face'' rule definition.

		While the download occurs, user agents must either wait until the
		font is downloaded or render once with substituted font metrics and
		render again once the font is downloaded.


	6. If no matching face exists or the matched face does not contain
		a glyph for the character to be rendered, the next family name is
		selected and the previous three steps repeated.  Glyphs from other
		faces in the family are not considered.  The only exception is that
		user agents may optionally substitute a synthetically obliqued version of the
		<em>default face</em> if that face supports a given glyph and synthesis
		of these faces is permitted by the value of the 'font-synthesis' property.
		For example, a synthetic italic version of the regular face might be used if the
		italic face doesn't support glyphs for Arabic.

		<!-- resolution on the above: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Nov/0292.html -->

	7. If there are no more font families to be evaluated and no matching
		face has been found, then the user agent performs an <dfn>installed font
		fallback</dfn> procedure to find the best match for the character to be
		rendered.  The result of this procedure can vary across user agents.

	8. If a particular character cannot be displayed using any
		font, the user agent should indicate by some means that a
		character is not being displayed, displaying either a
		symbolic representation of the missing glyph (e.g. using a <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_resort_font">Last
		Resort Font</a>) or using the missing character glyph from
		a default font.
</ol>

Optimizations of this process are allowed
provided that an implementation behaves as if the algorithm had been followed exactly.
Matching occurs in a well-defined order
to ensure that the results are as consistent as possible across user agents,
given an identical set of available fonts and rendering tech.

The <dfn export>first available font</dfn>,
used for example in the definition of <a>font-relative lengths</a> such as ''ex''
or in the definition of the 'line-height' property,
is defined to be the first font
for which the character U+0020 (space)
is not excluded by a 'unicode-range!!descriptor',
given the font families in the 'font-family!!property' list
(or a user agent's default font if none are available).

Installed fonts referenced directly by family name,
rather than via @font-face rules,
are considered to have a 'unicode-range!!descriptor'
that covers the entire Unicode code space.

Note: it does not matter whether that font actually has a glyph for the space character.

<h3 id="cluster-matching">
Cluster matching</h3>


	When text contains characters such as combining marks,
	ideally
	the base character should be rendered
	using the same font as the mark,
	this assures proper placement of the mark.
	For this reason,
	the font matching algorithm for clusters
	is more specialized
	than the general case of matching a single character by itself.
	For sequences containing variation selectors,
	which indicate the precise glyph to be used for a given character,
	user agents always attempt <a>installed font fallback</a>
	to find the appropriate glyph
	before using the default glyph of the base character.

	A sequence of codepoints containing combining mark
	or other modifiers
	is termed a grapheme cluster
	(see [[CSS3TEXT]] and [[UAX29]] for a more complete description).
	For a given cluster containing a base character,
	<em>b</em> and a sequence of combining characters
	<em>c1, c2&hellip;</em>, the entire cluster is matched using these steps:</p>

	<ol>

		<li>For each family in the font list,
			a face is chosen using the style selection rules
			defined in the previous section.
		<ol>

		<li>If all characters in the sequence <em>b + c1 + c2 &hellip;</em>
		are completely supported by the font,
		select this font for the sequence.</li>

		<li>If a sequence of multiple codepoints
			is canonically equivalent to a single character
			and the font <a>supports</a> that character,
			select this font for the sequence
			and use the glyph associated with
			the canonically equivalent character
			for the entire cluster.</li>

		</ol>

		<li>If no font was found in the font list in step 1:

		<ol>

		<li>If <em>c1</em> is a variation selector,
			system fallback must be used
			to find a font that <em title="support">supports</em>
			the full sequence of <em>b + c1</em>.
			If no font on the system <a>supports</a> the full sequence,
			match the single character <em>b</em>
			using the normal procedure for matching
			single characters
			and ignore the variation selector.
			Note: a sequence with more than one variation selector
			must be treated as an encoding error
			and the trailing selectors must be ignored. [[!UNICODE]]</li>

		<li>Otherwise, the user agent may optionally use
			installed font fallback
			to match a font that <a>supports</a>
			the entire cluster.</li>

		</ol>

		<li>If no font is found in step 2,
			use the matching sequence
			from step 1 to determine the longest sequence
			that is completely <a>supported</a>
			by a font in the font list
			and attempt to match the remaining combining characters
			separately using the rules for single characters.</li>

Character handling issues</h3>


	CSS font matching is always performed on
	text runs containing Unicode characters [[!UNICODE]],
	so documents using legacy encodings are assumed
	to have been transcoded before matching fonts.
	For fonts containing <a>character maps</a>
	for both legacy encodings and Unicode,
	the contents of the legacy encoding <a>character map</a>
	must have no effect on the results
	of the font matching process.

	The font matching process does not assume
	that text runs are in either normalized or denormalized form
	(see [[CHARMOD-NORM]] for more details).
	Fonts may only support precomposed forms
	and not the decomposed sequence of base character plus combining marks.
	Authors should always tailor their choice of fonts to their content,
	including whether that content contains
	normalized or denormalized character streams.

	If a given character is a Private-Use Area Unicode codepoint,
	user agents must only
	match font families named in the 'font-family' list
	that are not generic families.
	If none of the families
	named in the 'font-family' list
	contain a glyph for that codepoint,
	user agents must display some form of missing glyph symbol
	for that character
	rather than attempting <a>installed font fallback</a>
	for that codepoint.
	When matching the replacement character U+FFFD,
	user agents may skip the font matching process
	and immediately display
	some form of missing glyph symbol,
	they are not required to display
	the glyph from the font
	that would be selected
	by the font matching process.

	In general,
	the fonts for a given family
	will all have the same
	or similar <a>character maps</a>.
	The process outlined here
	is designed to handle even font families
	containing faces with widely variant <a>character maps</a>.
	However,
	authors are cautioned that
	the use of such families
	can lead to unexpected results.

Font Feature Properties</h2>

	Modern font technologies support a variety of
	advanced typographic and language-specific font features.
	Using these features,
	a single font can provide glyphs
	for a wide range of
	ligatures,
	contextual and stylistic alternates,
	tabular and old-style figures,
	small capitals,
	automatic fractions,
	swashes,
	and alternates specific to a given language.
	To allow authors control over these font capabilities,
	the 'font-variant!!property' property has been expanded.
	It now functions as a shorthand
	for a set of properties
	that provide control over
	stylistic font features.

<h3 id="glyph-selection-positioning">
Glyph selection and positioning</h3>

	This section is non-normative

	Simple fonts used for displaying Latin text
	use a very basic processing model.
	Fonts contain a <a>character map</a>
	which maps each character
	to a glyph for that character.
	Glyphs for subsequent characters
	are simply placed one after the other along a run of text.
	Modern font formats
	such as OpenType
	and AAT (Apple Advanced Typography)
	use a richer processing model.
	The glyph for a given character can be
	chosen and positioned
	not just based on the codepoint of the character itself,
	but also on adjacent characters
	as well as the language,
	script,
	and features enabled for the text.
	Font features may be
	required for specific scripts,
	or recommended as enabled by default
	or they might be stylistic features
	meant to be used under author control.
	The point at which font selection and positioning happens
	in the overall order of text processing operations
	(such as text transformation, text orientation and text alignment)
	is described in [[css-text-3#order]].

	For a detailed description of glyph processing
	for OpenType fonts,
	see [[WINDOWS-GLYPH-PROC]].

	Stylistic font features can be classified
	into two broad categories:
	ones that affect the harmonization of glyph shapes
	with the surrounding context,
	such as kerning and ligature features,
	and ones such as the small-caps,
	subscript/superscript and alternate features
	that affect shape selection.

	The subproperties of 'font-variant!!property' listed below
	are used to control these stylistic font features.
	They do not control features
	that are required for displaying certain scripts,
	such as the OpenType features used when displaying Arabic or Indic language text.
	They affect glyph selection and positioning,
	but do not affect font selection
	as described in the font matching section
	(except in cases required for compatibility with CSS 2.1).

	To assure consistent behavior across user agents,
	the equivalent OpenType property settings
	are listed for individual properties
	and are normative.
	When using other font formats
	these should be used as a guideline
	to map CSS font feature property values
	to specific font features.

<h3 id="language-specific-support">
Language-specific display</h3>

OpenType also supports language-specific glyph selection and
positioning, so that text can be displayed correctly in cases where
the language dictates a specific display behavior. Many languages
share a common script, but the shape of certain letters can vary
across those languages. For example, certain Cyrillic letters have
different shapes in Russian text than in Bulgarian. In Latin text,
it's common to render "fi" with an explicit fi-ligature that lacks a
dot on the "i". However, in languages such as Turkish which uses both
a dotted-i and a dotless-i, it's important to not use this ligature or
use a specialized version that contains a dot over the "i".

<wpt>
	language-specific-01.html
</wpt>

The
example below shows language-specific variations based on stylistic
traditions found in Spanish, Italian and French orthography:

<div class="featex"><img alt="language specific forms, spanish" src="images/locl-1.png"></div>
<div class="featex"><img alt="language specific forms, italian" src="images/locl-2.png"></div>
<div class="featex"><img alt="language specific forms, french" src="images/locl-3.png"></div>

If the content language of the element is known according to the
rules of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#doclanguage">document language</a>,
user agents are required to infer the OpenType language system from
the [=content language=] and use that when selecting and positioning
glyphs using an OpenType font.
If a [=writing system=] has been explicitly specified,
it must take precedence over the customary one implied by the [=content language=].


<!-- previously in level 3, now moved to Level 4 -->
For OpenType fonts, in some cases it may be necessary to explicitly
declare the OpenType language to be used, for example when displaying
text in a given language that uses the typographic conventions of
another language or when the font does not explicitly support a given
language but supports a language that shares common typographic
conventions. The 'font-language-override!!property' property is used for this
purpose.

<p>Kerning is the contextual adjustment
of inter-glyph spacing.
This property controls metric kerning,
kerning that utilizes adjustment data
contained in the font.</p>

<dl dfn-for="font-kerning" dfn-type="value">
<dt><dfn id="font-kerning-auto-value" title="auto!!font-kerning">auto</dfn></dt>
<dd>Specifies that kerning is applied at the discretion of the user agent</dd>
<dt><dfn id="font-kerning-normal-value" title="normal!!font-kerning">normal</dfn></dt>
<dd>Specifies that kerning is applied</dd>
<dt><dfn id="font-kerning-none-value" title="none!!font-kerning">none</dfn></dt>
<dd>Specifies that kerning is not applied</dd>
</dl>

<p>For fonts that do not include kerning data
this property will have no visible effect.
When rendering with OpenType fonts,
the [[!OPENTYPE]] specification suggests that
kerning be enabled by default.
When kerning is enabled,
the relevant OpenType kerning features are enabled
(for horizontal [=typographic modes=]
and for [=sideways typesetting=] in vertical [=typographic modes=],
the <span class="tag">kern</span> feature;
for [=upright typesetting=] in [=vertical typographic modes=],
the <span class="tag">vkrn</span> feature.
User agents must also support fonts
that only support kerning
via data contained in a
<span class="tag">kern</span> font table,
as detailed in the OpenType specification.
If the 'letter-spacing' property is defined,
kerning adjustments are considered part of the default spacing
and letter spacing adjustments are made
<em>after</em> kerning has been applied.</p>

<p>When set to <span title="auto!!font-kerning">'auto'</span>,
user agents can determine
whether to apply kerning or not
based on a number of factors:
text size,
script, or
other factors that influence text processing speed.
Authors who want proper kerning
should use <span title="normal!!font-kerning">'normal'</span>
to explicitly enable kerning.
Likewise,
some authors may prefer to disable kerning
in situations where performance
is more important than precise appearance.
However, in well-designed modern implementations
the use of kerning generally
does not have a large impact
on text rendering speed.</p>

simulated glyphs <!-- must --> should be synthesized
for all characters
using reduced forms of the glyphs

without this feature applied.
This is done per run
to avoid a mixture of variant glyphs and synthesized ones

In the case of OpenType fonts
that lack subscript or superscript glyphs

<p>In situations where text decorations
are only applied to runs of text
containing superscript or subscript glyphs,
the synthesized glyphs may be used,
to avoid problems with the placement of decorations.</p>

<p>In the past,
user agents have used font-size
and vertical-align
to simulate subscripts and superscripts
for the
<code title="HTML sub element">sub</code>
and <code title="HTML sup element">sup</code> elements.
To allow a backwards compatible way
of defining subscripts and superscripts,
it is recommended
that authors use conditional rules [[CSS3-CONDITIONAL]]
so that older user agents will still render
subscripts and superscripts via
the older mechanism.</p>

<p>Because <code>font-size: smaller</code>
is often used for these elements,
the effective scaling factor
applied to subscript and superscript text
varies depending upon the size.
For larger text,
the font size is often reduced by a third
but for smaller text sizes,
the reduction can be much less.
This allows subscripts and superscripts
to remain readable
even within elements using small text sizes.
User agents should consider this
when deciding how to synthesize
subscript and superscript glyphs.</p>

<p class="note">The OpenType font format
defines subscript and superscript metrics
in the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2">OS/2 table</a>
[[!OPENTYPE]]
but these are not always accurate in practice
and so cannot be relied upon
when synthesizing subscript and superscript glyphs.</p>

<p>Authors should note
that fonts typically only provide
subscript and superscript glyphs
for a subset of all characters
supported by the font.
For example,
while subscript and superscript glyphs
are often available for Latin numbers,
glyphs for punctuation and letter characters
are less frequently provided.
The synthetic fallback rules
defined for this property
try to ensure that subscripts and superscripts
will always appear
but the appearance may not match author expectations
if the font used does not provide
the appropriate alternate glyph
for all characters contained in a
subscript or superscript.</p>

<p>This property is not cumulative.
Applying it to elements
within a subscript or superscript
won't nest the placement
of a subscript or superscript glyph.
Images contained within text runs
where the value of this property
is 'sub' or 'super' will be drawn
just as they would
if the value was <span title="normal!!font-variant-position">'normal'</span>.</p>

<!-- due to lack of consensus, couldn't resolve on exact positioning of text decorations:
http://www.w3.org/2013/06/06-css-minutes.html#item03 -->

<p>Because of these limitations,
'font-variant-position'
is not recommended for use in user agent stylesheets.
Authors should use it
in cases where subscripts or superscripts
will only contain the narrow range of characters
supported by the fonts specified.</p>

<p class="note">The variant glyphs
use the same baseline
as the default glyphs would use.
There is no shift in the placement along the baseline,
so the use of variant glyphs doesn't affect
the height of the inline box
or alter the height of the linebox.
This makes superscript and subscript variants
ideal for situations where it's important
that leading remain constant,
such as in multi-column layout.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex-typical-ua-style">
<p>A typical user agent default style for the <span class="tag">sub</span> element:</p>

<pre>sub {
	vertical-align: sub;
	font-size: smaller;
	line-height: normal;
}
</pre>

<p>Using 'font-variant-position'
to specify typographic subscripts
in a way that will still show subscripts
in older user agents:</p>

<pre>@supports ( font-variant-position: sub ) {

	sub {
	vertical-align: baseline;
	font-size: 100%;
	line-height: inherit;
	font-variant-position: sub;
	}

}
</pre>

<p>User agents that support the 'font-variant-position' property
will select a subscript variant glyph
and render this
without adjusting the baseline or font-size.
Older user agents will ignore
the 'font-variant-position' property definition
and use the standard defaults for subscripts.
</p>

</wpt>

<p>This property allows
the selection of alternate glyphs
used for small or petite capitals or for titling.
These glyphs are specifically designed
to blend well with the surrounding normal glyphs,
to maintain the weight and readability
which suffers when text is simply resized
to fit this purpose.</p>

<p>Individual values have the following meanings:</p>

<dl dfn-for="font-variant-caps" dfn-type="value">
	<dt><dfn id="font-variant-caps-normal-value" title="normal!!font-variant-caps">normal</dfn>
	<dd>None of the features listed below are enabled.</dd>

	<dt><dfn>small-caps</dfn>
	<dd>Enables display of small capitals
	(OpenType feature: <span class="tag">smcp</span>).
	Small-caps glyphs typically use the form of uppercase letters
	but are reduced to the size of lowercase letters.

	<div class="featex"><img alt="small-caps example" src="images/smcp.png"></div>
	</dd>

	<dt><dfn>all-small-caps</dfn>
	<dd>Enables display of small capitals for both upper and lowercase letters
	(OpenType features: <span class="tag">c2sc, smcp</span>).</dd>

	<dt><dfn>petite-caps</dfn>
	<dd>Enables display of petite capitals
	(OpenType feature: <span class="tag">pcap</span>).</dd>

	<dt><dfn>all-petite-caps</dfn>
	<dd>Enables display of petite capitals for both upper and lowercase letters
	(OpenType features: <span class="tag">c2pc, pcap</span>).</dd>

	<dt><dfn>unicase</dfn>
	<dd>Enables display of mixture of small capitals for uppercase letters
	with normal lowercase letters
	(OpenType feature: <span class="tag">unic</span>).</dd>

	<dt><dfn>titling-caps</dfn>
	<dd>Enables display of titling capitals
	(OpenType feature: <span class="tag">titl</span>).
	Uppercase letter glyphs are often designed for use with lowercase letters.
	When used in all uppercase titling sequences
	they can appear too strong.
	Titling capitals are designed specifically for this situation.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The availability of these glyphs
is based on whether a given feature is defined or not
in the feature list of the font.
User agents can optionally decide this
on a per-script basis
but should explicitly not decide this
on a per-character basis.</p>

<p>Some fonts may only support a subset
or none
of the features
described for this property.
For backwards compatibility with CSS 2.1,
if 'small-caps' or 'all-small-caps' is specified
but small-caps glyphs are not available for a given font,
user agents should simulate a small-caps font,
for example by taking a normal font
and replacing the glyphs for lowercase letters
with scaled versions of the glyphs
for uppercase characters
(replacing the glyphs for both upper and lowercase letters
in the case of 'all-small-caps').</p>

<div class="figure" style="padding: 0; margin: auto;"><img class="hires" width=512 alt="synthetic vs. real small-caps" src="images/synthetic-vs-real-small-caps.png"><p class="caption">Synthetic vs. real small-caps</p></div>

<p>The 'font-feature-settings' property
also affects the decision of
whether or not to use a simulated small-caps font
(unlike CSS Fonts 3).<p>

<div class="example" id="ex-small-caps">
<pre>#example1 { font-variant-caps: small-caps; }
	#example2 { font-variant-caps: small-caps; font-feature-settings: 'smcp' 0; }</pre>
For fonts which don't support small caps, both #example1 and #example2
should be rendered with synthesized small caps. However, for fonts which
do support small caps, #example1 should be rendered with native small
caps, while #example2 should be rendered without any small-caps (native
or synthesized).
</div>

<p>To match the surrounding text,
a font may provide alternate glyphs
for caseless characters
when these features are enabled
but when a user agent simulates small capitals,
it must not attempt to simulate alternates
for codepoints which are considered caseless.</p>

<div class="figure" style="padding: 0; margin: auto;"><img class="hires" width=418 alt="caseless characters with small-caps, all-small-caps enabled" src="images/small-capitals-variations.png"><p class="caption">Caseless characters with small-caps, all-small-caps enabled</p></div>

<p>If either 'petite-caps' or 'all-petite-caps' is specified
for a font that doesn't support these features,
the property behaves as if
'small-caps' or 'all-small-caps', respectively,
had been specified.
If 'unicase' is specified
for a font that doesn't support that feature,
the property behaves as if 'small-caps' was applied
only to lowercased uppercase letters.
If 'titling-caps' is specified
with a font that does not support this feature,
this property has no visible effect.
When simulated small capital glyphs are used,
for scripts that lack uppercase and lowercase letters,
'small-caps', 'all-small-caps', 'petite-caps',
'all-petite-caps' and 'unicase'
have no visible effect.</p>

<p>When casing transforms are used
to simulate small capitals,
the casing transformations must match
those used for the <span class="property">'text-transform'</span> property.</p>

<p>As a last resort,
unscaled uppercase letter glyphs
in a normal font
may replace glyphs in a small-caps font
so that the text appears
in all uppercase letters.</p>

<pre class="prod"><dfn id="feature-value-name-value">&lt;feature-value-name&gt;</dfn> = <<ident>></pre>

For any given character, fonts can provide a variety of alternate
glyphs in addition to the default glyph for that character.  This
property provides control over the selection of these alternate
glyphs.

For many of the property values listed below, several different
alternate glyphs are available.  How many alternates are available
and what they represent is font-specific, so these are each marked
<dfn>font specific</dfn> in the value definitions below.  Because the nature
of these alternates is font-specific, the
''@font-feature-values'' rule is used to define values for a
specific font family or set of families that associate a font-specific
numeric <<feature-index>> with a custom
<<feature-value-name>>, which is then used in this
property to select specific alternates:

<pre class=example  id="ex-noble-script">
@font-feature-values Noble Script { @swash { swishy: 1; flowing: 2; } }

p {
	font-family: Noble Script;
	font-variant-alternates: swash(flowing); /* use swash alternate #2 */
}
</pre>

When a particular <<feature-value-name>> has not
been defined for a given family or for a particular feature type, the
computed value must be the same as if it had been defined.  However,
property values that contain these undefined <<feature-value-name>>
identifiers must be ignored when choosing glyphs.

<pre class=example  id="ex-effectively-same">
/* these two style rules are effectively the same */

p { font-variant-alternates: swash(unknown-value); } /* not a defined value, ignored */
p { font-variant-alternates: normal; }
</pre>

This allows values to be defined and used for a given set of font
families but ignored if fallback occurs, since the font family name
would be different. If a given value is outside the range supported by
a given font, the value is ignored.  These values never apply to
generic font families.

Individual values have the following meanings:

<dl dfn-for="font-variant-alternates" dfn-type="value">

	<dd>Enables replacement of default glyphs with ornaments, if provided in the font (<em>font specific</em>, OpenType feature: <span class="tag">ornm <<feature-index>></span>).
	Some fonts may offer ornament glyphs as alternates for a wide collection of characters; however, displaying arbitrary
	characters (e.g., alphanumerics) as ornaments is poor practice as it distorts the semantics of the data. Font designers
	are encouraged to encode all ornaments (except those explicitly encoded in the Unicode Dingbats blocks, etc.) as
	alternates for the bullet character (U+2022) to allow authors to select the desired glyph using ''ornaments()''.

<h3 id="font-feature-values">
Defining font specific alternates: the <dfn>@font-feature-values</dfn> rule</h3>

Several of the possible values of 'font-variant-alternates' listed above
are labeled as <em>font specific</em>;
a font can define not just a single glyph for the feature,
but <em>multiple</em> possible glyph variants,
and associate each one with a numeric index
to let you choose which to turn on.

These numeric indexes are idiosyncratic to each face;
a <code>swsh 1</code> feature on one font face might turn on the swash version of capital Q,
while on another font face it turns on the swash version of the &amp;.
Thus, specifying the index in 'font-feature-settings'
requires that the author know <em>exactly</em> which font will be used on an element;
if they get it wrong (due to font fallback selecting a different font)
they might end up turning on an entirely different,
and undesirable,
feature to what they wanted!
It also means that the author can't easily turn on similar features for elements with different fonts;
they have to individually set different 'font-feature-settings' values for each
that uses the correct numeric indexes for the desired features.

To fix this issue,
the ''@font-feature-values'' rule lets an author assign,
for each font face,
a human-friendly name to specific feature indexes.
Using these friendly names,
an author can easily turn on similar features regardless of the font in use
(if they've defined that name for all the fonts),
and be sure they're not accidentally turning on unrelated features
(as fonts without those names defined for them simply won't do anything).

<div class="example" id="ex-font-feature-values">
	<p>Using a commonly named value allows authors to use a single style rule
	to cover a set of fonts for which the underlying selector is different for
	each font. If either font in the example below is found, a circled number
	glyph will be used:
	</p>

	<pre>
	@font-feature-values Otaru Kisa {
	  @annotation { circled: 1; black-boxed: 3; }
	}
	@font-feature-values Taisho Gothic {
	  @annotation { boxed: 1; circled: 4; }
	}

	h3.title {
	  /* circled form defined for both fonts */
	  font-family: Otaru Kisa, Taisho Gothic;
	  font-variant: annotation(circled);
	}
	</pre>

	Trying to turn on the "circled" forms for either font explicitly,
	using 'font-feature-values',
	would require the author know <em>for certain</em> which font will be used;
	if they expected "Otaru Kisa" and wrote ''font-feature-values: nalt 1;'',
	it would turn on "circled" characters in Otara Kisa,
	but would instead turn on <strong>boxed</strong> characters
	if the system fell back to Taisho Gothic,
	as that's what Taisho Gothic associates with <code>nalt 1</code>!
</div>


<h4 id="font-feature-values-syntax">Basic syntax</h4>

An ''@font-feature-values'' rule's prelude
contains a list of font family names,
followed by a block containing multiple ''feature-value-block''s,
a special type of subsidiary at-rule.
Each ''feature-value-block''' contains declarations
mapping author-chosen human-friendly names
(such as "flowing")
to feature indexes for the associated feature.

Each <<font-feature-value>> has the same meaning
as the corresponding value of the 'font-variant-alternates' property.

<pre class=prod export>
@font-feature-values = @font-feature-values <<family-name>># { <<declaration-rule-list>> }

<dfn for="@font-feature-values">font-feature-value-type</dfn> = <<@stylistic>> | <<@historical-forms>> | <<@styleset>> | <<@character-variant>>
	| <<@swash>> | <<@ornaments>> | <<@annotation>>

<dfn for="@font-feature-values">@stylistic</dfn> = @stylistic { <<declaration-list>> }
<dfn for="@font-feature-values">@historical-forms</dfn> = @historical-forms { <<declaration-list>> }
<dfn for="@font-feature-values">@styleset</dfn> = @styleset { <<declaration-list>> }
<dfn for="@font-feature-values">@character-variant</dfn> = @character-variant { <<declaration-list>> }
<dfn for="@font-feature-values">@swash</dfn> = @swash { <<declaration-list>> }
<dfn for="@font-feature-values">@ornaments</dfn> = @ornaments { <<declaration-list>> }
<dfn for="@font-feature-values">@annotation</dfn> = @annotation { <<declaration-list>> }
</pre>

<wpt>
	alternates-order.html
	test_font_feature_values_parsing.html
</wpt>

The ''@font-feature-values'' prelude
is a comma-delimited list of font family names that match the definition of <<family-name>>
for the 'font-family!!property' property.
This means that only named font families are allowed;
rules that include generic or system fonts in the list of font families are syntax errors.
However, if a user agent defines a generic font to be a specific named font (e.g. Helvetica),
the settings associated with that family name will be used.
If syntax errors occur within the <<family-name>> list,
the entire rule ''@font-feature-values'' rule is invalid
and must be ignored.

The ''@font-feature-values'' block accepts <<declaration-rule-list>> as its contents;
these list items are either:

- [=at-rules=] named by one of the <<font-feature-value-type>> at-keyword tokens

or

- the '@font-feature-values/font-display' descriptor.

<!-- TODO: tab says "The OM needs to make sure it exposes both .style and .childRules or whatever." -->

Specifying the same <<font-feature-value-type>> more than once is valid;
their contents are cascaded together.
Each <<feature-value-block>> accepts a list of [=declarations=],
the <dfn lt="font feature value declaration">font feature value declarations</dfn>,
where the declaration's name can be any [=identifier=],
and the value must be a list of one or more non-negative <<integer>>s.

The <<feature-value-block>>s accept any declaration name;
these names must be identifiers,
per standard CSS syntax rules,
and are [=case-sensitive=]
(so ''foo: 1;'' and ''FOO: 2'' define two different features).
Each declaration's value must match the grammar ''<<integer [0,∞]>>+'',
or else the declaration is invalid and must be ignored.

Note: Each feature name is unique only within a single <<feature-value-block>>.
Between different <<feature-value-block>>s,
or the same type of <<feature-value-block>>s in separate ''@font-feature-values'' rules,
names can be reused without colliding.

For each <<family-name>> in the ''@font-feature-values'' prelude,
each [=font feature value declaration=] defines a mapping between a
(family name, feature block name, declaration name) [=tuple=]
and the list of one or more integers from the declaration's value.
If the same tuple appears more than once in a document
(such as if a single block),
the last-defined one is used.

<div class=example id="ex-same-font-feature-values">
	For example, the following all define the exact same set of font feature values:

	<pre>
	/* Default */
	@font-feature-values foo {
	    @swash { pretty: 1; cool: 2; }
	}

	/* Repeated declaration names */
	@font-feature-values foo {
	    @swash { pretty: 0; pretty: 1; cool: 2; }
	}

	/* Multiple blocks of the same type */
	@font-feature-values foo {
	    @swash { pretty: 1; }
	    @swash { cool: 2; }
	}

	/* Multiple rules for the same family */
	@font-feature-values foo {
	    @swash { pretty: 1; }
	}
	@font-feature-values foo {
	    @swash { cool: 2; }
	}
	</pre>
</div>

A syntax error within a [=font feature value declaration=]
makes the declaration invalid and ignored,
but does not invalidate the [=font feature value block=] it occurs in.
An unknown at-rule within a ''@font-feature-values'' block
(not using one of the predefined list of allowed at-keywords)
makes that at-rule invalid and ignored,
but does not invalidate the ''@font-feature-values'' rule.

<div class="example" id="ex-invalid-ignored">
	Rules that are equivalent given syntax error handling:

	<pre>
	@font-feature-values Bongo {
	    @swash { ornate: 1; }
	    annotation { boxed: 4; } /* should be @annotation! */
	    @swash { double-loops: 1; flowing: -1; } /* negative value */
	    @ornaments ; /* incomplete definition */
	    @styleset { double-W: 14; sharp-terminals: 16 1 } /* missing ; */
	    redrum  /* random editing mistake */
	}
	</pre>

	The example above is equivalent to:

	<pre>
	@font-feature-values Bongo {
	    @swash { ornate: 1; }
	    @swash { double-loops: 1; }
	    @styleset { double-W: 14; sharp-terminals: 16 1; }
	}
	</pre>
</div>

If multiple ''@font-feature-values'' rules are defined for
a given family, the resulting values definitions are the union of the
definitions contained within these rules. This allows a set of named
values to be defined for a given font family globally for a site and
specific additions made per-page.

<div class="example" id="ex-site-wide-per-page">
	Using both site-wide and per-page feature values:

	site.css:
	<pre>
	@font-feature-values Mercury Serif {
	    @styleset {
	        stacked-g: 3; /* "two-storey" versions of g, a */
	        stacked-a: 4;
	    }
	}
	</pre>

	page.css:

	<pre>
	@font-feature-values Mercury Serif {
	    @styleset {
	       geometric-m: 7; /* alternate version of m */
	    }
	}

	body {
	    font-family: Mercury Serif, serif;

	    /* enable both the use of stacked g and alternate m */
	    font-variant-alternates: styleset(stacked-g, geometric-m);
	}
	</pre>
</div>

<h4 id="multi-value-features">
Multi-valued feature value definitions</h4>

	Most <em>font specific</em> functional values of the 'font-variant-alternates' property
	take a single value (e.g. ''swash()'') which enables the feature.

<pre class="example" id="ex-single-valued-feature" >@font-feature-values Jupiter Serif {

	@swash {
		swishy: 5;     /* implies ss05 = 1 */
		swirly: 2;     /* implies ss02 = 1 */
	}
}
</pre>

	The ''character-variant()'' property value and the ''@character-variant'' descriptor allow two values,
	which enables a feature (from the first value) and sets it to a given (second) value.

<pre class="example" id="ex-two-valued-feature" >@font-feature-values MM Greek {

		@character-variant { alpha-2: 1 2; }   /* implies cv01 = 2 */
		@character-variant { beta-3: 2 3; }    /* implies cv02 = 3 */
	}
</pre>

	For the ''styleset()'' property value and ''@styleset'' rule,
	multiple values indicate the style
	sets to be enabled.  Values between 1 and 99 enable OpenType features
	<span class="tag">ss01</span> through <span class="tag">ss99</span>.
	However, the OpenType standard only officially defines
	<span class="tag">ss01</span> through <span class="tag">ss20</span>.
	For OpenType fonts, values greater than 99 or equal to 0 do not
	generate a syntax error when parsed but enable no OpenType features.


<pre class="example" id="ex-multi-valued-feature" >@font-feature-values Mars Serif {

	@styleset {
	alt-g: 1;        /* implies ss01 = 1 */
	curly-quotes: 3; /* implies ss03 = 1 */
	code: 4 5;       /* implies ss04 = 1, ss05 = 1 */
	}

	@styleset {
	dumb: 125;        /* &gt;99, ignored */
	}

	@swash {
	swishy: 3 5;     /* more than 1 value for swash, syntax error */
	}
}

p.codeblock {
	/* implies ss03 = 1, ss04 = 1, ss05 = 1 */
	font-variant-alternates: styleset(curly-quotes, code);
}</pre>

	For <<@character-variant>>, a single value between 1 and 99 indicates
	the enabling of OpenType feature <span class="tag">cv01</span> through
	<span class="tag">cv99</span>. For OpenType fonts, values greater than
	99 or equal to 0 are ignored but do not generate a syntax error when parsed
	but enable no OpenType features. When two values are listed, the first
	value indicates the feature used and the second the value passed for
	that feature.  If more than two values are assigned to a given name, a
	syntax error occurs and the entire
	feature value definition</i> is
	ignored.

<pre class="example" id="ex-greek-variant-features" >@font-feature-values MM Greek {

	@character-variant { alpha-2: 1 2; }   /* implies cv01 = 2 */
	@character-variant { beta-3: 2 3; }    /* implies cv02 = 3 */
	@character-variant { epsilon: 5 3 6; } /* more than 2 values, syntax error, definition ignored */
	@character-variant { gamma: 12; }      /* implies cv12 = 1 */
	@character-variant { zeta:   20 3; }   /* implies cv20 = 3 */
	@character-variant { zeta-2: 20 2; }   /* implies cv20 = 2 */
	@character-variant { silly: 105; }     /* &gt;99, ignored */
	@character-variant { dumb: 323 3; }    /* &gt;99, ignored */
}

#title {
	/* use the third alternate beta, first alternate gamma */
	font-variant-alternates: character-variant(beta-3, gamma);
}

p {
	/* zeta-2 follows zeta, implies cv20 = 2  */
	font-variant-alternates: character-variant(zeta, zeta-2);
}

.special {
	/* zeta follows zeta-2, implies cv20 = 3  */
	font-variant-alternates: character-variant(zeta-2, zeta);

dfn-for="font-variant" dfn-type="value">''none''</dfn> value
sets 'font-variant-ligatures' to 'none'
and resets all other font feature properties to their initial value.
Like other shorthands,
using <span title="font-variant!!property">'font-variant'</span>
resets unspecified <span title="font-variant!!property">'font-variant'</span> subproperties
to their initial values.</p>

<p>It does not reset the values of
'font-language-override',
<span title="font-feature-settings!!property">'font-feature-settings!!property'</span>
or <span title="font-variation-settings!!property">'font-variation-settings!!property'</span>.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex-scientific-inferiors">
<p>For example, there is no font-variant value to control
Scientific Inferiors (small numerals used in chemical formulae).
Readability is enhanced by using them, so they must be enabled
using font-feature-settings:</p>
<pre>
.chem {
	font-feature-settings: 'sinf'
}
</pre>
<figure>
	<img alt="scientific inferior numbers in a chemical formula" src="images/scientific-inferiors.png">
	<figcaption>Scientific inferiors improve readability of chemical formulae</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p class="note">The entire property value is set at once.
	Unlike the font-variant properties,
	there is no way to modify
	the inherited value
	by adding or removing individual features.
</p>

<p>A value of
<dfn id="font-feature-settings-normal-value" dfn-for="font-feature-settings" dfn-type="value"
title="normal!!font-feature-settings">'normal'</dfn>
means that no change
in glyph selection or positioning
occurs due to this property.</p>

<p>Feature tag values have the following syntax:</p>

<pre class="prod">
	<dfn dfn-for="font-feature-settings" dfn-type="value" id="feature-tag-value"><var>&lt;feature-tag-value&gt;</var></dfn> = &lt;opentype-tag&gt; [ &lt;integer [0,∞]&gt; | on | off ]?
	<dfn>&lt;opentype-tag&gt;</dfn> = &lt;string&gt;
</pre>

<p>The <<opentype-tag>> is a case-sensitive OpenType feature tag.
As specified in the OpenType specification [[!OPENTYPE]],
feature tags contain four ASCII characters.
Tag strings longer or shorter than four characters,
or containing characters outside the U+20&ndash;7E codepoint range
are invalid.
<!-- and what happens? ignored?
	 they won't be found in the font anyway, so the next section applies -->
Feature tags need only match
a feature tag defined in the font,
so they are not limited to
explicitly registered OpenType features.
Fonts defining custom feature tags
should follow the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featuretags.htm">tag name rules</a>
defined in the OpenType specification [[!OPENTYPE-FEATURES]].

<p id="must-not-synthesize-features">Feature tags
not present in the font are ignored;
a user agent must not attempt to synthesize fallback behavior
based on these feature tags.
The one exception is that
user agents may synthetically support the <span class="tag">kern</span> feature
with fonts that contain kerning data in the form of a 'kern' table
but lack <span class="tag">kern</span> feature support
in the 'GPOS' table.</p>

<p class="note">In general, authors should
use the 'font-kerning' property
to explicitly enable or disable kerning
since this property always affects fonts
with either type of kerning data.</p>

<p>If present,
a value indicates an index used for glyph selection.
An &lt;integer&gt; value must be 0 or greater.
A value of 0 indicates that the feature is disabled.
For boolean features,
a value of 1 enables the feature.
For non-boolean features,
a value of 1 or greater enables the feature
and indicates the feature selection index. A
value of 'on' is synonymous with 1
and 'off' is synonymous with 0.
If the value is omitted, a value of 1 is assumed.
</p>

<p id="ffs-map">The computed value
of font-feature-settings is a map,
so any duplicates in the specified value
must not be preserved.
If the same feature tag appears more than once,
the value associated with the last appearance supersedes
any previous value for that axis.</p>

<p id="ffs-sorted">The computed value contains the de-duplicated feature tags,
	sorted in ascending order by [=code unit=].
</p>

<div class="example" id="ex-font-feature-settings-map">
<pre>
font-feature-settings: "sinf" 1;       /* sinf=1 enable Scientific Inferiors */
font-feature-settings: "sinf" on;      /* sinf=1 enable Scientific Inferiors */
font-feature-settings: 'sinf';         /* sinf=1 enable Scientific Inferiors */
font-feature-settings: "sinf" off;     /* sinf=0 disable Scientific Inferiors */
font-feature-settings: "sinf", 'twid'; /* sinf=1, twid=1 enable Scientific Inferiors and Third Widths */
font-feature-settings: "sinf" "twid";  /* invalid, need a comma-delimited list */
font-feature-settings: "silly" off;    /* invalid, tag too long */
font-feature-settings: "PKRN";         /* PKRN=1 enable custom feature */
font-feature-settings: sinf;           /* invalid, tag must be a string */
</pre>
</div>

<p>When values greater than the range
supported by the font
are specified,
the behavior is explicitly undefined.
For boolean features, in general these will enable the feature.
For non-boolean features,
out of range values will in general
be equivalent to a 0 value.
However,
in both cases the exact behavior
will depend upon the way the font is designed
(specifically, which type of lookup is used
to define the feature).</p>

<p>Implementations may choose to ignore
turning off features which
the OpenType specification says are always required,
such as required ligatures "rlig".</p>

<wpt>
	font-variant-ligatures-11.optional.html
</wpt>

<p>Although specifically defined for OpenType feature tags,
feature tags for other modern font formats
that support font features
may be added in the future.
Where possible,
features defined for other font formats
should attempt to follow
the pattern of registered OpenType tags.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex-half-width-kana">
<p>The Japanese text below will be rendered with half-width kana characters:</p>

Normally, authors can control the use of language-specific glyph substitutions and positioning
by setting the content language of an element, as <a href="#language-specific-support">described
	above</a>:

<div class="example" id="ex-font-lang-override">
<pre>&lt;!-- Display text using S'gaw Karen specific features -->

	&lt;p lang="ksw">...&lt;/p></pre>
</div>

In some cases, authors may need to specify a language system
that differs from the content language, for example due to the need to mimic another language's
typographic traditions.  The 'font-language-override!!property' property allows authors to explicitly specify
the language system of the font, overriding the language system implied by the content language.

Values have the following meanings:

<dl dfn-for="font-language override" dfn-type="value">
	<dt><dfn id="font-language-override-normal-value">normal</dfn></dt>
	<dd>specifies that when rendering with OpenType fonts,
	  the content language of the element is used to infer the OpenType language system</dd>
	<dt><dfn data-dfn-type=value data-dfn-for=font-language-override id="font-language-override-string-value"><<string>></dfn></dt>
	<dd>single four-character case-sensitive OpenType <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/languagetags.htm">language system tag</a>,
	  specifies the OpenType language system to be used instead of the language system implied by the language of the element.
	  If the string is shorter than four characters,
	  it is padded at the end with space (U+0020) characters
	  such that the length is 4, before being matched.
	</dd>
</dl>

<!-- For this level, string represents a single language code, there's no concept of "fallback"
https://www.w3.org/2013/06/07-css-minutes.html#item04 -->

<!-- this para replaced, https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1104

Use of invalid OpenType language system tags must not generate a
parse error but must be ignored when doing glyph selection and
placement.
-->

Unknown OpenType language system tags are silently ignored, and do not affect
glyph selection and placement.

<div class="example" id="ex-related-language">
The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of
Human Rights</a> has been translated into a wide variety of languages.  In Turkish,
Article 9 of this document might be marked up as below:

<pre lang="tr">&lt;body lang="tr">

&lt;h4>Madde 9&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Hiç kimse keyfi olarak tutuklanamaz, alıkonulanamaz veya sürülemez.&lt;/p>
</pre>

Here the user agent uses the value of the 'lang' attribute when rendering text and
appropriately renders this text without 'fi' ligatures.  There is no need
to use the 'font-language-override!!property' property.

However, a given font may lack support for a specific language.  In this
situation authors may need to use the typographic conventions of a related language
that are supported by that font:

<pre lang="mk">&lt;body lang="mk">     &lt;!-- Macedonian lang code --&gt;

body { font-language-override: "SRB"; /* Serbian OpenType language tag */ }

&lt;h4>Члeн 9&lt;/h4>

</pre>

As the content creator knows that font specified supports Serbian, the Macedonian text
here will be rendered using Serbian typographic conventions.
</div>

<h2 id="font-feature-variation-resolution">
Font Feature and Variation Resolution</h3>

As described in the previous section,
font features and variations can be enabled in a variety of ways,
either via the use of 'font-variant!!property',
'font-feature-settings!!property',
'font''font-variation-settings!!property' in a style rule
or within an ''@font-face'' rule.
The resolution order for the union of these settings is defined below.
Features defined via CSS properties are applied on top of layout engine default features.

<h3 id="default-features">
Default features</h3>

For OpenType fonts,
user agents must enable the default features
defined in the OpenType documentation
for a given script and writing mode.
Required ligatures, common ligatures and contextual forms
must be enabled by default
(OpenType features: <span class="tag">rlig, liga, clig, calt</span>),
along with localized forms
(OpenType feature: <span class="tag">locl</span>),
and features required for proper display of composed characters and marks
(OpenType features: <span class="tag">ccmp, mark, mkmk</span>).
These features must always be enabled,
even when the value of the 'font-variant!!property' and 'font-feature-settings!!property' properties is <css>normal</css>.
Individual features are only disabled when explicitly overridden by the author,
as when 'font-variant-ligatures!!property' is set to 'no-common-ligatures'.

<h3 id="feature-variation-precedence">
Feature and variation precedence</h3>

General and <em>font specific</em> font feature property settings are
resolved in the order below, in ascending order of precedence.  This ordering is
used to construct a combined list of font features that affect a given
text run.

1. Font features enabled by default are applied, including features required for a given script.
	    See [[#default-features]] for a description of these.

2. <span id="apply-font-matching-variations">Font variations as enabled by the 'font-weight!!property',
		'font-width!!property', and 'font-style!!property' properties are applied.</span>

	The application of the value enabled by
	'font-style!!property' is affected by font selection, because this property might select an
	italic or an oblique font. The value applied is the closest matching value as determined
	by the <a href="#font-style-matching">font matching algorithm</a>. User agents must apply
	at most one value due to the 'font-style!!property' property; both "ital" and "slnt" values must
	not be set together.

	If the selected font is defined in an ''@font-face'' rule, then the values applied at this step
	should be clamped to the value of the 'font-weight!!descriptor', 'font-width!!descriptor',
	and 'font-style!!descriptor'
	descriptors in that ''@font-face'' rule.

	Then, the values applied in this step should be clamped (possibly again) to the values
	that are supported by the font.

3. The language specified by the inherited value of lang/xml:lang is applied.

4. If the font is defined via an ''@font-face'' rule, the font language override
	implied by the 'font-language-override!!descriptor' descriptor in the ''@font-face'' rule is applied.

5. If the font is defined via an ''@font-face'' rule, that ''@font-face'' rule includes
	at least one valid 'font-named-instance' descriptor
	with a value other than 'font-named-instance/none',
	and the loaded font resource includes a named instance with that name
	according to the [[#localized-name-matching]] rules,
	then all the variation values represented by that named instance are applied.
	These values are clamped to the values that are supported by the font.

6. If the font is defined via an ''@font-face'' rule, the font variations
	implied by the 'font-variation-settings!!descriptor' descriptor in the ''@font-face'' rule are applied.

7. If the font is defined via an ''@font-face'' rule, the font features
	implied by the 'font-feature-settings!!descriptor' descriptor in the ''@font-face'' rule are applied.

8. The font language override implied by the value of the 'font-language-override!!property' property is applied.

9. Font variations implied by the value of the 'font-optical-sizing!!property' property are applied.

10. Font features implied by the value of the 'font-variant!!property' property,
	the related 'font-variant!!property' subproperties and any other CSS property
	that uses OpenType features (e.g. the 'font-kerning!!property' property) are applied.

	<!-- other CSS props override 'font-variant' but not 'font-feature-settings' -->
	<!-- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Aug/0110.html -->

11. Feature settings determined by properties other than 'font-variant!!property' or
	'font-feature-settings!!property' are applied. For example, setting a
	non-default value for the 'letter-spacing' property disables optional ligatures.

12. Font variations implied by the value of the 'font-variation-settings!!property' property are applied.
	These values should be clamped to the values that are supported by the font.

13. Font features implied by the value of 'font-feature-settings!!property' property are applied.

This ordering allows authors to set up a general set of defaults
for fonts within their ''@font-face'' rules, then override them with
property settings for specific elements. General property settings
override the settings in ''@font-face'' rules and low-level font feature
settings override 'font-variant!!property' property settings.

For situations where the combined list of font feature settings
contains more than one value for the same feature, the last value is
used. When a font lacks support for a given underlying font feature,
text is simply rendered as if that font feature was not enabled; font
fallback does not occur and no attempt is made to synthesize the
feature except where explicitly defined for specific properties.

Feature precedence examples</h3>

<div class="example" id="ex-tabular-prices">
	With the styles below, numbers are rendered proportionally when used within
	a paragraph but are shown in tabular form within tables of prices:

	<pre>
	body {
	  font-variant-numeric: proportional-nums;
	}

	table.prices td {
	  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
	}
	</pre>
</div>

<div class="example" id="ex-features-local">
	The ''@font-face'' rule can also be used to access font features in locally available
	fonts via the use of <code>local()</code> in the 'src!!descriptor' descriptor of the ''@font-face'' definition:

	<pre>
	@font-face {
	  font-family: BodyText;
	  src: local("HiraMaruPro-W4");
	  font-variant: proportional-width;
	  font-feature-settings: "ital"; /* Latin italics within CJK text feature */
	}

	body { font-family: BodyText, serif; }
	</pre>

	If available, a Japanese font "Hiragino Maru Gothic" will be used.  When text
	rendering occurs, Japanese kana will be proportionally spaced and Latin text will
	be italicized.  Text rendered with the fallback serif font will use default
	rendering properties.
</div>

<div class="example" id="ex-no-dlig-in-special">
	In the example below, discretionary ligatures are enabled only for a downloadable font
	but are disabled within spans of class "special":

	<pre>
	@font-face {
	  font-family: main;
	  src: url(fonts/ffmeta.woff) format("woff");
	  font-variant: discretionary-ligatures;
	}

	body         { font-family: main, Helvetica; }
	span.special { font-variant-ligatures: no-discretionary-ligatures; }
	</pre>

	Suppose one adds a rule using 'font-feature-settings' to enable discretionary ligatures:

	<pre>
	body         { font-family: main, Helvetica; }
	span         { font-feature-settings: "dlig"; }
	span.special { font-variant-ligatures: no-discretionary-ligatures; }
	</pre>

	In this case, discretionary ligatures <em>will</em> be rendered
	within spans of class "special".
	This is because both the 'font-feature-settings' and 'font-variant-ligatures' properties
	apply to these spans.
	Although the ''no-discretionary-ligatures'' setting of 'font-variant-ligatures'
	effectively disables the OpenType "dlig" feature,
	because the 'font-feature-settings' is resolved after that,
	the "dlig" value reenables discretionary ligatures.

Typographically,
text rendered at different sizes
often benefits from slightly different visual representations.
For example, to aid reading at small text sizes,
strokes are often thicker with larger serifs.
Larger text often has a more delicate figure
with more contrast between thicker and thinner strokes.

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=font-optical-sizing>
	<dt><dfn id="font-optical-sizing-auto-value">auto</dfn>
	<dd>
		The user agent may modify the shape of glyphs
		based on the font-size and the pixel density of the screen.
		For OpenType and TrueType fonts using font variations,
		this is often done by using the "opsz" font variation.
	<dt><dfn id="font-optical-sizing-none-value">none</dfn>
	<dd>
		The user agent must not modify the shape of glyphs for optical size.
</dl>

<figure id="optical-size-example">

	<figcaption>
		Each size of Century Expanded as it existed in analog metal form.
		The different optical sizes,
		normalized here to the same physical size,
		have design variations to maintain stylistic traits and improve readability.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

'font-size' must be considered when selecting a variation value for the "opsz" axis,
but other signals may also be considered.

Note: User agents are expected to supply a value for the "opsz" axis
which is close to the used value for 'font-size'.
However, user agents might wish to consider other factors
such as pixel density of the screen,
or the solid angle the text subtends in the viewer's retina.
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/807#issue-195683688">Experiments have shown</a>,
however, that disregarding these other ancillary factors
and using only 'font-size' might be the best way for a user agent to select this value.

Pixel density as well as visual size of the text
may influence the variation value chosen for 'font-optical-sizing'.
When either pixel density or visual size of the text
changes in response to a user operation or style change,
user agents must not choose a new value for this variation value
unless the change is layout-causing.
User agents are free to determine which changes are layout-causing.

Note: Some user operations,
such as pinch-zoom,
can be considered not-layout-causing
if they do not cause text to reflow.
However, other user operations,
such as increasing text size for accessibility purposes,
can be considered layout-causing because they cause text to reflow.
Similarly, the 'transform' property can be considered not-layout-causing
because transforms generally do not cause text to reflow.
Each user-agent is free to decide
whether or not each operation is layout-changing or not.

User agents must not synthesize optical sizing
when it is not performed by the font directly.

User agents must not select a value for the "opsz" axis
which is not supported by the font used for rendering the text.
This can be accomplished by clamping a chosen value to the range supported by the font.

'font-optical-sizing' interacts with 'font-size-adjust'. When applying optical sizing, User agents must
apply an optical sizing value appropriate for the adjusted font size, subject to the above restrictions.

This property provides low-level control

</table>
</div>

The use of font variation settings
does not affect font selection
where a fallback font is to be used,
where using font properties for the same axis
would have an effect on font selection.

When possible,
authors should generally use the other properties related to font variations
(such as 'font-optical-sizing'),
and only use this property for special cases
where its use is the only way of accessing a particular infrequently used font variation.

For example,
it is preferable to use 'font-weight!!property': 700
rather than 'font-variation-settings': "wght" 700.

A value of ''font-variation-settings/normal'' means that no change in glyph shape, matching, or positioning occurs due to this property.

The <<opentype-tag>> is a case-sensitive OpenType or TrueType variation axis name.
As specified in the OpenType / TrueType specifications,
axis names contain four ASCII characters.
Axis name strings longer or shorter than four characters,
or containing characters outside the U+20&ndash;7E codepoint range
are invalid.
Axis names need only match an axis tag defined in the font,
so they are not limited to explicitly registered OpenType / TrueType variation axes.
Fonts defining custom axis names
should follow the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/fvar.htm">name rules</a> defined in the OpenType specification.

If a given axis is not supported by a font,
its value setting is ignored and therefore has no effect;
a user agent must not attempt to synthesize fallback behavior based on these axis tags.
Other axis values within the same CSS 'font-variation-settings' statement are not ignored.

If a variation axis is supported by a font
but its set value is greater or less than the predefined font range,
it will be clamped to the closest value supported by the font.

Values are allowed to be fractional or negative.

Note: it is preferable to obtain slanted faces
by using the 'font-style!!property' property.
However, if using the <code>slnt</code> axis directly,
via 'font-variation-settings',
remember that it is defined
with a positive angle meaning a counter-clockwise slant,
the opposite direction to CSS.

If the same axis name appears more than once, the value associated with the last appearance supersedes any previous value for that axis. This deduplication is observable by accessing the computed value of this property.

<p id="fvs-sorted">The computed value contains the de-duplicated axis names,
sorted in ascending order by [=code unit=].</p>

Although specifically defined for OpenType / TrueType variations,
variation axes for other modern font formats that support font variations
might be added in the future.
Where possible,
variations defined for other font formats
should attempt to follow the pattern of registered variation axes.

Animating font-variation-settings is possible
using the following mechanism. Two declarations of font-feature-settings can be animated between if they are "like".
"Like" declarations are ones where the same set of properties appear (in any order). Because successive duplicate properties are applied instead of prior duplicate properties, two declarations can be "like" even if they have differing number of properties.
If two declarations are "like"
then animation occurs pairwise between corresponding values in the declarations.
Otherwise, animation is not possible.
In this situation,
the "from" values of the animation are swapped to the "to" values
at an unspecified time during the animation.

<h2 id="color-font-support">
Color Font Support</h2>

Color fonts allow for font files to describe,
not just the contours describing the edges of glyphs,
but also the colors present inside the glyphs.

<figure id="multicolore">
	<img src="images/multicolore.png" alt="an example multicolored font">
	<figcaption>Multicolore, by Ivan Filipov</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure id="magicalunicorn">
		<img src="images/please.png" alt="an example multicolored font">
		<figcaption>Magical Unicorn Neue Pro, by Arthur Reinders Folmer</figcaption>
</figure>

For some uses, such as emoji,
having the colors fixed in the font is appropriate.
For others, there is a need to control the colors used from a stylesheet.

<wpt>
	font-colorization.html

</wpt>

CSS provides two ways to do this.
The 'font-palette' property allows selecting
one of several different palettes
contained in the font.
The ''@font-palette-values'' rule allows overriding
one or more colors from within a palette
or even
the creation of an entirely different palette.

Controlling Color Font Palettes: The 'font-palette' property</h3>

Many color font file formats allow colors within glyphs to be parameterized.
In these fonts, colors are referenced by index when describing the geometry of each glyph.
These indices are resolved within a current active palette
using a lookup table present inside the font.
However, many fonts contain multiple palettes,
each containing a set of complementary colors
chosen by the font designer to provide pleasing visual results.

In addition, some color font file formats
provide a regular, uncolored glyph outline
as well as the colored versions.

<h3 id="font-palette-values">
User-defined font color palettes: The ''@font-palette-values'' rule</h3>

	The <dfn>@font-palette-values</dfn> rule defines a color palette
	and associates that color palette with a specific font.
	This allows a web author to select arbitrary <<color>>s to use inside a color font
	rather than being limited to the preexisting palettes inside font files.

	Note: The OpenType 'CPAL' table is restricted to sRGB colors.
	The <<color>>s in ''@font-palette-values'' allow any CSS color.
	Some implementations currently use APIs which are restricted to sRGB
	and may therefore map the specified colors to sRGB.
	This is expected to be a temporary limitation.
	Authors should not rely on this mapping to sRGB.

	In addition, this rule's association with a specific font
	allows a name of a palette to apply differently to different fonts,
	which allows similar colors to be used across multiple fonts
	when multiple fonts are used in an element
	(i.e. for font fallback).

	Note: A web author might wish to create multiple palettes for a single font
	in order to create multiple themes for their web content.
	A web author might also wish to create matching palettes for multiple fonts
	to achieve a consistent design across a collection of different fonts.

	A ''@font-palette-values'' rule represents a palette of colors used in a font.
	A palette consists of an ordered collection of colors.
	Using the ''@font-palette-values'' allows a web author
	to reference a palette existing within a font
	as well as creating a palette populated with author-defined colors.
	In addition, it allows overriding a set of colors from a palette in the font
	with colors described by the web author.

	A palette is always <i>complete</i>, meaning that it is impossible to describe
	a palette which has missing colors. If colors would be missing, they are taken
	from the palette within the font identified by the 'base-palette!!descriptor' descriptor.

	[=Math functions=], such as ''calc()'',
	and also ''var()'', and ''env()'',
	are valid within descriptor values in a
	''@font-palette-values'' rule. They are evaluated within the context of the root
	element. Relative units are also evaluated within the context of the root element.

	The ''@font-palette-values'' rule consists of the ''@font-palette-values'' at-keyword
	followed by a block of descriptor declarations.
	It has the following syntax:

	<pre class=prod>
	    @font-palette-values <<dashed-ident>> {
	        <<declaration-list>>
	    }
	</pre>

		palette-values-rule-delete-2.html
		palette-values-rule-delete.html
		parsing/font-palette-values-invalid.html
		parsing/font-palette-values-valid.html
	</wpt>

	The ''@font-palette-values'' rule accepts the descriptors defined in this specification.

	<div class="example" id="ex-bixa-palette">
		Modify Bixa Color's color palette.

	    <pre>
	    @font-palette-values --Cooler {
	        font-family: Bixa;
	        base-palette: 1;
	        override-colors:

	    }
		</pre>

	</div>

	<div class="example" id="ex-handover-palette">
	    Modify Handover Sans's color palette

	    <pre>
	    @font-palette-values --Augusta {
	        font-family: Handover Sans;
	        base-palette: 3;
	        override-colors:
	            1 rgb(43, 12, 9),
	            3 var(--highlight);
	    }
	    </pre>
	</div>

	These descriptors apply solely within the context of the ''@font-palette-values'' rule in which they are defined,
	and do not apply to document language elements.
	When a given descriptor occurs multiple times in a given ''@font-palette-values'' rule,
	only the last descriptor declaration is used
	and all prior declarations for that descriptor are ignored.

	Each of these palettes are applied
	to each @font-face that share a family name.

	<div class="example" id="ex-greenish-two-fonts">
		I want to use two color fonts in a greenish palette.
		The first font, Bixxxa, already has palette that I can use,
		but for Bungeehee I need to overwrite one color
		to get my green palette.

		<pre class="lang-css">
			@font-face {
				font-family: Bixxxa;
				src: url('./bixxxa.woff') format('woff');
			}

			@font-face {
				font-family: Bungeehee;
				src: url('./bungeehee.woff') format('woff');
			}

			@font-palette-values --ToxicGreen {
			  font-family: Bixxxa;
			  base-palette: 3; /* This is Bixxxa's green palette */
			}


			@font-palette-values --ToxicGreen {
			  font-family: Bungeehee;
			  base-palette: 7; /* This is Bungeehee's green palette... */
			  override-colors: 2 lime; /* ...except this is pink, which I overwrite to lime */
			}

			h1 {
				font-family: Bixxxa;
				font-palette: --ToxicGreen;
			}

			h2 {
				font-family: Bungeehee;
				font-palette: --ToxicGreen;
			}
		</pre>

		<em>Example by Roel Nieskens</em>
	</div>

	Note: In the case where a family name is shared
	between multiple physical fonts,
	(such as when a compound font is created, using 'unicode-range!!descriptor'),
	and if those fonts have different palettes,
	the result of specifying a partial palette
	using ''@font-palette-values''
	is unlikely to be what the author intended.
	In this case,
	it is better to supply a complete palette definition.

	<div class="example" id="ex-named-palettes">
		In the above example,
		since two different font families have been set up
		to have compatible named palettes,
		one could go on to write

		<pre class="lang-css">
			h3 {
				font-family: Bixxxa, Bungeehee;
				font-palette: --ToxicGreen;
			}
		</pre>

		Which would correctly apply the desired palette
		in each font
		even though they have different palette numbers.
	</div>

	A given set of ''@font-palette-values'' rules
	define which author-defined palettes are available for use
	within the documents that contain these rules.

	An author-defined font color palette
	must only be available to the documents that reference it.
	Using an author-defined color palette outside of the documents that reference it
	would constitute a security leak
	since the contents of one page would be able to affect other pages,
	something an attacker could use as an attack vector.

	This at-rule follows the forward-compatible parsing rules of CSS.
	Like properties in a declaration block,
	declarations of any descriptors that are not supported by the user agent
	must be ignored.
	''@font-palette-values'' rules require a '@font-palette-values/font-family' descriptor;
	if it is missing,
	the ''@font-palette-values'' rule is invalid and must be ignored entirely.

	In cases where user agents have limited platform resources,
	do not implement support for color fonts,
	or implement the ability to disable color fonts,
	''@font-palette-values'' rules must simply be ignored;
	the behavior of individual descriptors as defined in this specification should not be altered.

<h4 id="font-family-2-desc">
Font family: the '@font-palette-values/font-family' descriptor</h4>

	<pre class='descdef'>
	Name: font-family
	Value: <<family-name>>#
	For: @font-palette-values
	Initial: N/A
	</pre>

	This descriptor defines the font families that this palette applies to,
	using the same list of font families as [[#font-matching-algorithm]].
	This palette will only ever be applied to the fonts with these family names.
	The value of this descriptor  means that only named font families are allowed
	and rules that include generic fonts in the list of font families
	are syntax errors.
	If syntax errors occur within the font family list,
	the descriptor must be ignored
	(will still be in the CSS OM, but will not match any font families).

	                2 var(--highlight);
	        }
	        </pre>
	    </div>

	This descriptor specifies a palette in the font
	which the containing ''@font-palette-values'' rule uses as an initial value.
	If no <<override-colors>> key is present in the ''@font-palette-values'' rule,
	then the ''@font-palette-values'' rule represents the palette in the font
	with the same index as the value of this descriptor.
	If a <<override-colors>> key is present in the ''@font-palette-values'' rule,
	each item in the value of that descriptor overrides a single color
	in the color palette represented by this ''@font-palette-values'' block.

	<div class="example" id="ex-handover-3rd">
	    Rename Handover Sans's 3rd color palette

	    <pre>
	    @font-palette-values --Augusta {
	        font-family: Handover Sans;
	        base-palette: 3;
	    }
	    </pre>
	</div>

	If this descriptor is not present in the ''@font-palette-values'',
	or if the font does not contain a palette at the index of the value of 'base-palette',
	it behaves as if ''0'' were specified.
	If a font does not contain any color palettes,
	no colors are included in the initial color palette
	represented by this ''@font-palette-values'' rule.
	Colors in the palette can be overridden
	by using the 'override-color!!descriptor' descriptor in the ''@font-palette-values'' rule.

<h4 id="override-color">
Overriding a colors from a palette: The 'override-colors!!descriptor' descriptor</h4>

	<pre class='descdef'>
	Name: override-colors
	Value: [ <<integer [0, ∞]>> <<color>> ]#
	For: @font-palette-values
	Initial: N/A
	</pre>

	This descriptor overrides colors
	to the initial color palette represented by this ''@font-palette-values'' rule.

	The specified <<color>> must be an
	[=absolute color=].

	The '@font-palette-values/override-colors' descriptor takes
	a comma-separated list of palette index entries and colors.
	Each item in the comma-separated list represents a tuple of
	an entry into the palette and a color to replace it with.

	For each key/value pair in the value of this descriptor,
	the color with that key in the initial palette (i.e. by using the 'base-palette' descriptor)
	is overwritten by the color specified in this descriptor's value.
	A key that is outside the range of indices of the initial palette is ignored.

	Palette index entries
	in the ''@font-palette-values/override-colors'' descriptor
	are a (zero-based) palette index entry.

	Integer values are zero-indexed.

	If the keys of multiple distinct key/value pairs identify the same color index (either by name or by integer),
	the last key is used for the purposes of rendering. However, for serialization purposes, both
	key/value pairs are present.

	Note: This means that using 'font-palette' with the same value on two different elements
	might result in different used palettes
	because the value of variables inside the ''@font-palette-values'' rule
	might apply differently in the context of those two elements.

	Colors provided from CSS
	(as overrides, or as new entries)
	may use any supported colorspace.

	<div class="example" id="ex-palette-anycolorspace">
		Modify Blaka Ink's color palette

		<pre>

<h3 id="font-variant-emoji-prop">
Selecting the text presentation style: The 'font-variant-emoji' property</h3>

<pre class="propdef">
Name: font-variant-emoji
Value: normal | text | emoji | unicode
Initial: normal
Applies to: all elements and text
Inherited: yes
Percentages: N/a
Computed value: specified keyword
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

<wpt>
	font-variant-emoji-1.html
	font-variant-emoji-2.html
	font-variant-emoji-003.html
	font-variant-emoji-004.html
	variation-sequences.html
	parsing/font-variant-emoji-computed.html
	parsing/font-variant-emoji-invalid.html
	parsing/font-variant-emoji-valid.html
</wpt>

This property allows web authors to select
whether emoji presentation or text presentation is used
for certain emoji code points.
Traditionally, these presentation styles were selected
by appending Variation Selector 15 (U+FE0E) or Variation Selector 16 (U+FE0F)
to certain code points.
However, 'font-variant-emoji' allows web authors to set a default presentation style
which can replace the variation selectors.

Only the code points <a href="http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-variants.html">listed</a> by Unicode
as contributing to a Unicode emoji presentation sequence
are affected by this property.
Within this CSS specification,
these characters are referred to as <dfn id="emoji-presentation-participating-code-points">Emoji Presentation Participating Code Points</dfn>.
This property has no effect on any other characters.

This property is expected to affect font fallback;
however, the exact nature of the interaction of font fallback with 'font-variant-emoji'
is explicitly unspecified.
However, a variation selector must be included in a previous cluster
as defined by the <a href="#cluster-matching">cluster matching</a> section above.
A natural result of this behavior
is that a variation selector must not be rendered in a different font than the previous character.
It thus causes font fallback to behave
as if the respective variation selector was intended
(as in the values description);
then font fallback, including the cluster fallback rules, is performed,
which must take the presentation preference
of these "appended" variation selectors into account.

Even when 'font-variant-emoji' is used,
the presence of Variation Selector 15 (U+FE0E) or Variation Selector 16 (U+FE0F)
in the contents of an element
override the rendering specified in 'font-variant-emoji'.
Therefore, 'font-variant-emoji' sets a default presentation
which the text being rendered can opt out of.

Note: Different platforms have different conventions about how to handle emoji presentation sequences.
A cross-platform UA might wish to follow the conventions of each individual platform,
or it might wish to use the same approach on all platforms.
When tasked with a request for an emoji style rendering,
a UA might wish to disregard fonts which do not include color tables.
A different UA might wish instead to use the same mechanical cluster fallback algorithm
that it would use for any arbitrary cluster.

Variation selectors other than FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 and U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16
must not have any effect on font selection.
If one of these variation selectors is present,
but unsupported by the font previously selected,
the variation selector is ignored.

BCP47's <code>-u-</code> extension to the language tag accepted by <code>lang</code> or <code>xml:lang</code> should not be
considered when the user-agent decides whether to use emoji presentation or text presentation for a particular character.

<dl dfn-for=font-variant-emoji dfn-type=value>

		If present, FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 and U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16

<h2 id="font-taxonomy">
Font Taxonomy</h2>

A given font may belong in one or more of the following categories:

<h3 id="installed-fonts">
Installed Fonts</h3>

A font may be installed globally on a device. Such fonts are generally accessible in any application, even applications which have no concept of CSS. The file or files backing the font object exist on the user's device, not as a remote resource.

Installed Fonts must not be Web Fonts, and Web Fonts must not be Installed Fonts.

<h3 id="web-fonts">
Web Fonts</h3>
A font may be backed by a remote resource, which must be requested using the user agent's resource fetching infrastructure. Web Fonts are represented by one of two mechanisms:

- ''@font-face'' rules
- A ''FontFace'' member of the Document's ''FontFaceSet''

A Web Font must not be accessible in any other Document from the one which either is associated with the ''@font-face'' rule or owns the ''FontFaceSet''. Other applications on the device must not be able to access Web Fonts.

Installed Fonts must not be Web Fonts, and Web Fonts must not be Installed Fonts.

Web Fonts shadow Installed Fonts, so if an Installed Font has the same family name as a Web Font, the Installed Font is not accessible.

<h3 id="preinstalled-and-user-installed-fonts">
Preinstalled Fonts and User-Installed Fonts</h3>

Users can choose to install fonts on their devices.
User-Installed Fonts are installed by an explicit action by the user,
such as clicking an "Install" button
or copying a file into a particular directory on their device.
Such fonts are User-Installed Fonts and also are Installed Fonts.
Web content authors should not count on the presence of user-installed fonts,
because there is no guarantee any user will have
performed the action to install a specific font.

Please see the <a href="#font-matching-algorithm">Font Matching Algorithm</a>
description of how user-installed fonts may interact with the font matching algorithm.

Any Installed Font which is not a User-Installed font is a Preinstalled Font. It is likely that all users of a particular version of a particular Operating System will have the same set of Preinstalled Fonts installed. As such, Web content authors targeting these Operating Systems may wish to use these fonts' family names inside 'font-family!!property' properties.

<h3 id="system-font">
System Font</h3>

The System Font is the font which is used by the ''system-ui'' <a href="#system-ui-def">generic font family name</a>. It is an example of a Preinstalled Font.

	Web authors can specify the 'tech' function

	Given the overlap in common usage between TrueType and OpenType,
	the format hints "truetype" and "opentype"
	must be considered as synonymous;
	a format hint of "opentype" does not imply
	that the font contains Postscript CFF style glyph data
	or that it contains OpenType layout information
	(see <a href="#platform-props-to-css">Appendix A</a> for more background on this).

Each value map attribute of <code>CSSFontFeatureValuesRule</code> reflects the values

but the <code>set</code> method has different behavior.  It takes a sequence of unsigned integers and
associates it with a given <code>featureValueName</code>. The method
behaves the same as the default map class method
except that a single unsigned long value is treated as a sequence of a
single value. The method throws an exception if an invalid number of
values is passed in.  If the associated

only allows a limited number of values, the <code>set</code> method
throws an <code>InvalidAccessError</code> exception when the input

Appendix A: Mapping platform font properties to CSS properties</h2>


	<em>This appendix is included as background for some of the problems and
	situations that are described in other sections.  It should be viewed as
	informative only.</em>

	Font properties in CSS are designed to be
	independent of the underlying font formats used;
	they can be used to specify bitmap fonts,
	Type1 fonts,
	SVG fonts
	in addition to the common TrueType and OpenType fonts.
	But there are facets of the TrueType and OpenType formats
	that often cause confusion for authors
	and present challenges to implementers
	on different platforms.

	Originally developed at Apple,
	TrueType [[TRUETYPE]] was designed as an outline font format
	for both screen and print.
	Microsoft joined Apple
	in developing the TrueType format
	and both platforms have supported
	TrueType fonts since then.
	Font data in the TrueType format consists of
	a set of tables distinguished with common four-letter tag names,
	each containing a specific type of data.
	For example,
	naming information,
	including copyright and license information,
	is stored in the 'name' table.
	The <a>character map</a> ('cmap') table
	contains a mapping
	of character encodings to glyphs.
	Apple later added additional tables
	for supporting enhanced typographic functionality;
	these are now called Apple Advanced Typography, or AAT, fonts.
	Microsoft and Adobe developed
	a separate set of tables for advanced typography
	and called their format OpenType [[OPENTYPE]].
	The OpenType specification is standardized at ISO as the
	Open Font Format [[OPEN-FONT-FORMAT]].

	In many cases the font data used under Microsoft Windows
	or Linux
	is slightly different from the data used under Apple's Mac OS X
	because the TrueType format allowed for
	explicit variation across platforms.
	This includes font metrics,
	names and
	<a>character map</a> data.

	Specifically,
	font family name data is handled differently
	across platforms.
	For TrueType and OpenType fonts
	these names are contained in the 'name' table,
	in name records with name ID 1.
	Multiple names can be stored for different locales,
	but Microsoft recommends fonts
	always include at least a US English version of the name.
	On Windows,
	Microsoft made the decision for backwards compatibility
	to limit this family name to a maximum of four faces;
	for larger groupings the
	"preferred family" (name ID 16) or
	"WWS family" (name ID 21)
	can be used.
	Other platforms such as OSX don't have this limitation,
	so the family name is used to define all possible groupings.

	Other name table data provides names used
	to uniquely identify a specific face within a family.
	The full font name (name ID 4) and
	the Postscript name (name ID 6)
	describe a single face uniquely.
	For example,
	the bold face of the Gill Sans family
	has a fullname of "Gill Sans Bold" and
	a Postscript name of "GillSans-Bold".
	There can be multiple localized versions of the fullname for a given face,
	but the Postscript name is always a unique name
	made from a limited set of ASCII characters.

	On various platforms,
	different names are used to search for a font.
	For example,
	with the Windows GDI CreateIndirectFont API,
	either a family or fullname can be used to lookup a face,
	while on Mac OS X the CTFontCreateWithName API call is used
	to lookup a given face
	using the fullname and Postscript name.
	Under Linux,
	the fontconfig API allows
	fonts to be searched using any of these names.
	In situations where platform API's
	automatically substitute other font choices,
	it may be necessary to
	verify a returned font matches a given name.

	The weight of a given face can be determined
	via the usWeightClass field of the OS/2 table
	or inferred from the style name (name ID 2).
	Likewise, the width can be determined
	via the usWidthClass of the OS/2 table
	or inferred from the style name.
	For historical reasons
	related to synthetic bolding at weights 200 or lower with the Windows GDI API,
	font designers have sometimes skewed values in the OS/2 table
	to avoid these weights.

	Rendering complex scripts that use contextual shaping
	such as Thai,
	Arabic
	and Devanagari
	requires features present only in OpenType or AAT fonts.
	Currently,
	complex script rendering is supported
	on Windows and Linux using OpenType font features
	while both OpenType and AAT font features are used
	under Mac OS X.

Security Considerations
</h2>

See items <a href="#sp209">9</a>, <a href="#sp216">16</a> and <a href="#sp217">17</a> in the self-review questionnaire below.

<h2 id="privacy">
Privacy Considerations
</h2>

Following <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/#questions">Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy</a>,
and using the [[#font-taxonomy]]:

<h3 id="sp201"> What information might this feature expose to Web sites or other parties, and for what purposes is that exposure necessary?</h3>

This specification allows the use of Web Fonts,
which are requested on demand
but are not installed.
In the case where the document or stylesheet has a different origin to the Web Font,
this network request exposes information in the Referer header,
which may be harvested by font providers.

In addition to Web Fonts, this specification continues to allow
the use of Installed Fonts (both  Preinstalled Fonts and User-Installed Fonts)
as introduced in CSS1.

While Web Fonts have the advantage of consistency across platforms,
Installed Fonts have the advantage of zero download time.

In some cases, and particularly for poorly-supported or minority languages,
Installed Fonts allow information to be displayed which could not otherwise be displayed
because there is no freely licensable Web Font which supports that language
or because the latency or download time would make it's use infeasible,
particularly for languages with a large character repertoire,
or on slow or metered connections.

Note: The set of <a href="#installed-fonts">installed fonts</a>
available in the <a href="#font-matching-algorithm">Font Matching Algorithm</a>
is explicitly undefined.
The available set of fonts <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org">is</a>
used by trackers to fingerprint users and reduce their privacy.
However, some <a href="#installed-fonts">installed fonts</a>,
even some <a href="#preinstalled-and-user-installed-fonts">user-installed fonts</a>,
are required to make languages readable.
User Agents may choose to make all installed fonts available
for language support and design integrity reasons,
or may choose to make some fonts unavailable for privacy reasons.
In addition, User Agents may have additional facilities for fine-tuning this balance,
such as interfaces which prompt users to explicitly make
certain requested fonts available or unavailable
(perhaps on a per-site basis).
Different User Agents, even running on the same Operating System,
are expected to strike different balances here.

In the case of user agents which perform rendering of local resources
(such as an HTML and CSS to PDF renderer,
or a Web-based wordprocessor)
access to all Installed Fonts
(both  Preinstalled Fonts and User-Installed Fonts)
is necessary to provide the expected functionality.

An attacker may obtain fingerprinting information by querying the Installed Fonts.
In contrast to older technologies
(notably Adobe Flash, which provided a complete list of Installed Fonts
and sent this information in HTTP headers)
such probing must be done one font at a time,
providing the font family name
and then checking
(either via script,
or by using unicode-range to selectively download webfonts
depending on whether the user has a font by a certain name
that supports a certain character)
whether the font was loaded.
This takes time, and checking for more than a few hundred fonts
introduces a noticeable delay in page rendering.

For <em>especially privacy-sensitive contexts</em>,
options would include never downloading any webfonts
(at the risk that some characters may be rendered incorrectly, or not at all),
or always downloading all webfonts whether needed or not
(ignoring unicode-range,
and potentially downloading vast quantities of unused fonts
each time the page is viewed).

<h3 id="sp202">Is this specification exposing the minimum amount of information necessary to power the feature? </h3>

An emerging consensus is that a user agent must expose Preinstalled Fonts
for correct functioning,
but there is no consensus on exposing User-Installed Fonts.
This specification <a href="#preinstalled-and-user-installed-fonts"> allows a user agent</a>
to ignore User-Installed Fonts for the purpose of the Font Matching Algorithm.
Several existing user agents already do this.

The minimum amount varies by type of user and is <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4497">currently being debated</a>.
There is a useful <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4055#issuecomment-536169515">taxonomy of User-Installed Font users</a>
which has been <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4055#issuecomment-536815201"> slightly extended</a>.

A permissive amount of information exposes potentially more fingerprinting information;
a restrictive amount of information reduces fingerprinting but also reduces functionality
and in some cases, for minority languages, would break the Web completely for those users.

The possibility of a configurable, per-user opt-in to exposing some or all User-Installed Fonts,
or a per-origin opt-in, is being discussed.

The possibility of a privacy budget, which would penalize or disable
a malicious web page which tested a large number of fonts,
but allow a harmless page which tested a much smaller number,
has also been discussed.

Some user agents expose a more restricted set of Preinstalled Fonts
in their Private Browsing, Incognito, or Resist Fingerprinting modes,
compared to their normal mode.


<h3 id="sp203"> How does this specification deal with personal information or personally-identifiable information or information derived thereof? </h3>

Personal information is not exposed by this specification.

Personally identifiable information may be exposed in some cases.
For example, for someone in Japan, having conditionally-enabled Japanese fonts
enumerable probably isn't a substantial fingerprinting vector.
For someone in Europe who has a Japanese IME in the text input menu, they are.

<h3 id="sp204">How does this specification deal with sensitive information?</h3>

Fingerprinting on Installed Fonts may expose sensitive information in some cases.
For example, persecuted minorities risk leaking sensitive information
by exposing that they use fonts required for a persecuted minority language;
either by requesting a Web Font from a third party service,
or exposing Preinstalled Fonts or User-Installed Fonts associated with that language.

<h3 id="sp205"> Does this specification introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions?</h3>

No.

Specifically, Web Fonts <a href="#web-fonts">must not be accessible
in any other Document from the one which either is associated with the @font-face rule
or owns the FontFaceSet.
Other applications on the device must not be able to access Web Fonts.</a>
This avoids information leaking across origins.

Similarly, font palette values
<a href="#font-palette-values">must only be available to the documents that reference it</a>.
Using an author-defined color palette outside of the documents that reference it
would constitute a security leak since the contents of one page
would be able to affect other pages,
something an attacker could use as an attack vector.


<h3 id="sp206">What information from the underlying platform, e.g. configuration data, is exposed by this specification to an origin? </h3>

The ''system-ui'' keyword exposes the operating system's default system UI font to fingerprinting mechanisms.

<h3 id="sp207">Does this specification allow an origin access to sensors on a user’s device</h3>

No.

<h3 id="sp208">What data does this specification expose to an origin? Please also document what data is identical to data exposed by other features, in the same or different contexts. </h3>

For third-party Web Fonts loaded via a stylesheet,
the stylesheet origin may be exposed to the third party in the Referer header.
In addition, careful pairing of unicode-range and distinct src urls
allows the third-party to see which characters are used on a page,
which is a privacy risk for large character repertoire scripts
such as CJK.

For third-party Web Fonts preloaded in the HTML,
the document origin may be similarly exposed.

<h3 id="sp209">Does this specification enable new script execution/loading mechanisms? </h3>

No.

Specifically, for SVG-in-OpenType color fonts,
the SVG used for glyph definitions should not contain script elements,
and any script elements that do occur will not be executed.

<h3 id="sp210">Does this specification allow an origin to access other devices? </h3>

No.

<h3 id="sp211">Does this specification allow an origin some measure of control over a user agent’s native UI?</h3>

There is some risk that an attacker can spoof a native UI feature
by determining the Operating System
and using native-looking fonts appropriate to that Operating System.

<h3 id="sp212">What temporary identifiers might this specification create or expose to the web? </h3>

None.

<h3 id="sp213">How does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts?</h3>

<a href="#font-fetching-requirements">For font loads</a>, user agents must use the
potentially CORS-enabled fetch method defined by the [[!HTML]] specification
for URLs defined within @font-face rules.
When fetching, user agents must use "Anonymous" mode,
set the referrer source to the stylesheet’s URL
and set the origin to the URL of the containing document.

Thus, fonts will typically not be loaded cross-origin
unless authors specifically take steps to permit cross-origin loads.

<h3 id="sp214">How does this specification work in the context of a user agent’s Private Browsing or "incognito" mode? </h3>

The specification makes no distinction.

Some user agents may expose a more restricted set of Installed Fonts in these modes.

<h3 id="sp215"> Does this specification have a "Security Considerations" and "Privacy Considerations" section?</h3>

Yes.

<h3 id="sp216"> Does this specification allow downgrading default security characteristics?</h3>

No.

<h3 id="sp217">What should this questionnaire have asked? </h3>

It should have asked whether a malicious payload could crash the application,
or indeed the entire Operating System,
or even cause remote code execution.

This possibility does exist for suitably crafted fonts
on some platforms
when fonts are installed and rendered,
and this has been exploited in the wild.

In practice, user agents running on Operating Systems with this vulnerability
use a font sanitizer to detect such malformed or malicious fonts
and prevent their being used.

<h2 id="a11y">
	Accessibility Considerations
	</h2>

	The use of fonts to provide a visual rendering of text should not, in general, impact accessibility.
	For example, people using a screen reader to render text to speech will not download fonts,
	and are unaffected by what those fonts would have contained.

	However, this assumes that the semantics conveyed by the font glyphs
	and the semantics conveyed by the characters
	are the same.

	Historically, this has not always been the case.
	For example, in the early days of the Web it was common to use fonts
	(such as "Symbol", though others were used)
	to make Latin letters have Greek glyphs;
	while this worked visually,
	it would not work with a screen reader
	and text was also hard to search or index
	because the mapping was font-specific.
	With the rise of Unicode, it is now standard practice to use Greek characters for Greek text,
	and for Greek glyphs in fonts to map to Greek characters.

	Sadly, but avoidably, this practice persists
	with badly designed icon fonts.
	For example, such a font might put a "printer" icon on the Latin letter "P".
	This practice scatters meaningless letters through the text,
	which negatively affects text searching and indexing,
	gives hard to understand rendering if the icon font does not load,
	and impedes screen readers.
	A well designed font must assign such icons to semantically meaningful characters.
	For example, the printer icon might be assigned to the string "printer"
	or to the Unicode character 🖨 U+1F5A8 (PRINTER).
