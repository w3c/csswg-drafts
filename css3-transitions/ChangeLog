- Qualify the table style with a classname to avoid styling the propdef tables.
- Switch back to the Editors Draft stylesheet.

2012-01-30 simon.fraser@apple.com
- Formatting only. Change from spans to code elements for correct styling.

2011-07-24 dino@apple.com

- Inverted range of visibility property (Sylvain feedback 28 April)
- Zero times now have the unit specifier (dbaron feedback 11 April)
- Lists repeat if possible in transitions (Sylvain feedback 7 April)
  Also, removed "space-separated" from that section. Lists can be
  comma-separated too.

- change shorthand transition description to say that *any* transitionable
  property will move
- steps() takes an integer >= 1
- cubic bezier timing function can take control points with y
  values outside [0,1]

2011-03-21 simon.fraser@apple.com

 - Removed "Module Level 3" from the title.

2010-08-22 dino@apple.com

- added steps() timing function

2010-04-26 simon.fraser@apple.com

- added clip to the list of animatable properties

2010-03-10 dino@apple.com

- remove background-image from the list of animatable properties

2009-11-24 dbaron@dbaron.org

- fix TAB characters that I mistakenly introduced in the source
- fix sentence structure (oddly placed parenthetical) that caused confusion

2009-11-22 dbaron@dbaron.org

- define that unknown and non-animatable properties must be kept in the
  list for 'transition-property'
- define how shorthands work as a value of 'transition-property'
- add issue about whether 'none', 'all', 'inherit', and 'initial' within
  a list of length greater than one 
- define behavior for a property being repeated in 'transition-property'
  the last occurrence wins, as described in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009May/0153.html
- note open issue about whether the list length that matters is that of the
  longest transition-* list or the length of the transition-property list
- note open issue on whether colors are interpolated premultiplied or not
- added myself as a co-editor
- added section on Starting of transitions to address the following issues:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Jun/0121.html
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Oct/0338.html
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Oct/0339.html
  the first of which has a tentative group resolution in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Jul/0050.html
- added rule for animation of shadow lists of different lengths, per
  group resolution in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Jul/0050.html

2009-11-17 dino@apple.com

- added rules for reversibility of transforms

2009-11-01 dino@apple.com

- made it clear that shorthand accepts duration before delay
  but also noted the request for 1s/2s type syntax
- space-separated lists of animatable property values are only
  interpolated if the lists have the same number of elements
- noted that the TransitionEvent is for notification, and thus
  has no default action (ie. cancelling the event doesn't really
  do anything)
- added elapsedTime to the context info of the TransitionEvent
- made it clear that transition events do not fire if the transition
  is cancelled (say if the transition-property is changed)
- described that shorthand properties can be animated
- referenced the SVG specification for the list of SVG properties that
  can be animated
- changed transition properties from "visual" media to "interactive",
  which means they do not apply to print
- noted that lists in transition properties repeat as a whole in order
  to provide necessary values
- added apostrophes into the property definitions (as reported by Øyvind)
- noted that shadow lists only interpolate when there are the same number
  of elements in the list
- Changes properties applying to "block-level and inline-level elements" to
  "all elements".
- Transitions also apply to :before and :after pseudo elements
