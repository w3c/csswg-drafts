Introduction</h2>

	<em>This section is not normative.</em>

	Grid Layout is a layout model for CSS
	that has powerful abilities to control the sizing and positioning
	of boxes and their contents.
	Grid Layout is optimized for 2-dimensional layouts:
	those in which alignment of content is desired in both dimensions.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/grid-layout.png"
		     alt="An example of grid layout:
		     two rows of items,
		     the first being four items &mdash; the last of which spans both rows,
		     and the second being two items &mdash;
		     the first of which spans the first two columns &mdash;
		     plus the spanned item from the first row.">
		<figcaption>Representative Grid layout example</figcaption>
	</figure>

	Although many layouts can be expressed with regular Grid Layout,
	restricting items into a grid in both axes also makes it impossible
	to express some common layouts on the Web.

	This module defines a layout system that removes that restriction
	so that items can be placed into Grid-like tracks in just one of the axes,
	while stacking them one after another in the other axis.
	Items are placed into the column (or row) with the most remaining space
	based on the layout size of the items placed so far.
	This module also extends <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/">CSS Grid</a>
	with this new grid item placement strategy
	and <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-align">CSS Box Alignment</a> with new alignment features.

<h3 id='background'>
Background and Motivation</h3>

<h4 id='waterfall'>
Waterfall Layout with Auto-placed Items</h4>

	[=Masonry layout=], sometimes also called “waterfall layout”,
	is a common Web design pattern where a number of items--
	commonly images or short article summaries--
	are placed one by one into columns
	in a way that loosely resembles stone masonry.
	Unlike [[CSS-MULTICOL-1|multi-column layout]],
	where content is placed vertically in the first column
	until it must spills over to the second column,
	[=masonry layout=] selects a column for each new item
	such that it is generally closer to the top of the layout than items placed later.

	<div class="example">
		The Pinterest search results page exemplifies this layout:

		<figure>
			<img src="images/pinterest.png"
			     alt="An example of masonry layout:
			          four columns of items,
			          each item is placed into the column with the smallest height so far.">
			<figcaption>Representative masonry layout example</figcaption>
		</figure>

		Here, each item has a different height
		(depending on the content and the width of the column),
		and inspecting the DOM reveals
		(as the visual content itself gives no indication of ordering)
		that each item has been placed into the column with the smallest height so far.
	</div>

	This layout superficially looks similar to multi-column layout;
	but it has the advantage that scrolling down
	will naturally lead to "later" items in the layout
	(that is, those less relevant in the search results).

	It's not possible to achieve this layout using earlier CSS layout models,
	unless you know up-front how tall each item will be,
	or use JavaScript for content measurement or placement.

	Using a [=masonry container=] together with ''grid-area/auto''-positioned items
	yields this type of masonry layout.

<h4 id='collapse'>
One-dimensional Grid Layout</h4>

	[=Grid layout=] allows for powerful track sizing and explicit placement in two axes,
	but sometimes a layout only needs alignment of its items in one dimension.

	Using a [=masonry container=] together with explicitly-positioned items
	allows for this type of one-dimensional grid layout.

	<div class="example">
		This example <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10233#issuecomment-2071279204">by Douglas Graham</a>
		uses explicit positioning to place each item into its assigned column;
		but there are no rows.
		Instead, items in each column stack one after the other.
		This layout can't be duplicated in [=grid layout=]
		because the “spanning” relationships among the items in adjacent columns
		is not fixed: it depends on their relative heights
		and whether the optional banner or advertisement items are included.
		It also can't be duplicated in [=flex layout=]
		because the source order of the items
		(which is used for reading, sequential navigation, and one-column mobile phone layout)
		goes back and forth between the two columns.

			          the main content area, an advertisement block, and finally the footer.
			          In two-column layout:
			          the header spanning both columns on top,
			          the footer spanning both columns at the bottom,
			          in the wider left column the optional banner followed by the main content area,
			          and in the narrow left column the secondary navigation followed by the advertisement block.">

<h3 id="alternative-proposals">
Alternative Syntax Proposals</h3>

	<div class="issue">
		The masonry layout feature of this specification is drafted with two different syntaxes
		to promote debate and discussion of these two alternatives.

		<dl>
			<dt><dfn noexport><span class="option grid">Grid-integrated Option</span></dfn>
			<dd>
				In this syntax model, [=masonry layout=] is integrated into the [=grid layout=] model,
				re-using all of the 'grid-*' properties.

			<dt><dfn noexport><span class="option masonry">Grid-independent Option</span></dfn>
			<dd>
				In this syntax model, [=masonry layout=] is its own 'display' type,
			and has its own parallel set of 'masonry-*' properties.
		</dl>
	</div>

<h3 id="values">
Value Definitions</h3>

	This specification follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]]
	using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs">value definition syntax</a> from [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values &amp; Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification
	also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> as their property value.
	For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

<h2 id='masonry-model'>
Masonry Layout Model</h2>

	<dfn>Masonry layout</dfn>
	lays out items into pre-defined tracks similar to [=grid layout=] in one axis
	(called the <dfn local-lt="grid-axis">grid axis</dfn>),
	but flows them freely similar to [=flex layout=] in the other
	(called the <dfn local-lt="stacking-axis">stacking axis</dfn>).
	Similar to [=grid layout=] and unlike [=flex layout=],
	[=masonry layout=]’s auto-placement
	distributes items across the tracks  to keep the lengths of those tracks
	as similar as possible.

	[=Grid items=] are formed and [=blockified=]
	exactly the same as in a regular [=grid container=].

	(For clarity, [=grid items=] and [=grid tracks=] of a [=masonry container=]
	can be referred to as <dfn export lt="masonry item">masonry items</dfn>
	and <dfn export lt="masonry track">masonry tracks</dfn>.)

	All CSS properties work the same as in a regular [=grid container=]
	unless otherwise specified by this specification.
	For example, 'order' can be used to specify a different layout order for the items.

	Note: Subgrid items are supported,
	but subgridding only occurs in the [=grid axis=];
	see [[#subgrids]] for details.

	A <dfn>masonry container</dfn> is a box whose contents participate in [=masonry layout=].
	A [=masonry container=] is a <dfn export>column masonry container</dfn>
	if its [=stacking axis=] is the [=block axis=],
	or a <dfn export>row masonry container</dfn>
	if its [=stacking axis=] is the [=inline axis=].

<h3 id="order-accessibility">
Reordering and Accessibility</h3>

	Although [=masonry layout=] generally progresses in a forwards fashion
	(placing the next item down or endward of the current item,
	matching the natural "reading order"),
	it can switch between these two in a seemingly arbitrary manner.
	In simple cases, the 'masonry-slack' property can help reduce
	the feeling of backtracking due to small sizing differences in the [=block axis=]
	when laying out auto-placed items.
	But when [[#masonry-layout-algorithm|auto-placement]] is mixed with [=definite position|explicit placement=] or spanning items,
	some amount of backtracking may occur.

	<div class=example>
		For example, in the following markup sample,
		the fourth item is a spanner that doesn't fit
		in the remaining empty column on the first line.
		It ends up positioned into the into the first column,
		which is the highest available space into which it will fit.
		The next few items, which have a span of 1,
		end up laying out “above” it in the empty column,
		violating the natural reading order.

		<xmp highlight=html>

			  <div class=item>2</div>
			  <div class="item tall">3</div>
			  <div class="item wide">4</div>
			  <div class=item>5</div>

			  display: masonry;
			  masonry-tracks: repeat(5, auto);
			}
			.item { height: 50px; }
			.item.wide { masonry-track: span 3; }
			.item.tall { height: 90px; }
			</style>
		</xmp>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/masonry-reorder-span.png"
			     alt="In this example, the first row is items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6,
			          with item 3 slightly taller than the others.
			          Item 4 spans the first three columns, and is placed
			          just below item 3, while item 7 is tucked under item 5.">
			<figcaption>Auto-placed masonry layout with mixed-height items and mixed span sizes</figure>
		</figure>
		Similarly, items explicitly placed into specific tracks can leave gaps behind them,
		into which subsequent auto-placed items can be placed visually out-of-order.
	</div>

	Authors should be aware of these possibilities
	and design layouts where such backtracking is minimized
	so that focus and reading order can be more easily followed.
	Alternatively, if the items do not have an inherent order,
	use the 'reading-flow' property to allow the UA to re-order the items
	for reading and linear navigation.

	ISSUE: Or should reordering be the default behavior for auto-placed items here?

	<div class=note>
		Techniques for reducing backtracking include:
		* Using appropriate values for 'masonry-slack',
			i.e. values large enough to avoid gratuitous differentiation among similarly-sized tracks,
			but not so large that meaningful differences get ignored.
		* Using explicit placement in ways that help group related items together,
			rather than ways that disrupt the natural order of items
		* Avoiding the combination of mixed span sizes in the [=grid axis=]
			and disparate item sizes in the [=stacking axis=],
			which can cause items to get pulled out of order (see example above).
	</div>

	As with [=grid layout=] and [=flex layout=]
	authors can use the 'order' property to re-order items;
	the same caveats apply.
	See [[css-grid-2#order-accessibility]]
	and [[css-flexbox-1#order-accessibility]].

	</pre>

	[=Masonry layout=] can be applied to [=grid containers=]
	by specifying the value ''grid-template-columns/masonry'' for one of its axes,
	defining it as the [=stacking axis=].
	Such [=grid containers=] are called [=masonry containers=].

	If ''grid-template-columns/masonry'' is specified
	for both ''grid-template-columns'' and ''grid-template-rows'',
	then the [=used value=] for ''grid-template-columns'' is ''grid-template-columns/none'',
	and thus the [=inline axis=] will be the [=grid axis=].

	and
	<dfn value>wrap-reverse</dfn>,
	which reverse the directions of the [=grid item placement algorithm=].

	In [=masonry layout=], the flow axis specified by ''grid-auto-flow'' is ignored:
	items are always placed by filling across the [=grid axis=].

	ISSUE: Should that be the case, or should we follow the 'grid-auto-flow' axis always
	(so it would fill similar to flexbox, but with explicitly-sized tracks)?

	ISSUE(9326):
	Should <css>dense</css> packing apply to masonry?
	It's much more expensive in masonry,
	as you have to lay out the element in every possible gap spot
	to see if it's short enough to fit;
	Grid gets to just juggle some integers.

<h2 id="masonry-track-templates">
Masonry Track Specification</h3>

	In the [=grid axis=],
	the full power of [=grid layout=] is available for track specification:
	* Track sizes, line names, and areas can be specified on the [=masonry container=]’s [=grid axis=],
		just like in [=grid layout=].
	* The [=explicit grid=] and [=implicit grid=] are formed in the same way as for a regular [=grid container=].
	* Items can be [[#masonry-track-placement|placed]] against these grid templates just as in [=grid layout=].

	However,
	auto-placed items contribute sizing to all tracks,
	not just the track into which they are ultimately placed;
	see [[#track-sizing]].

	Note: This is because auto-placed items must be laid out <em>as</em> they are placed,
	so that each track knows how “full” it is
	(and therefore which track should receive the next auto-placed item);
	thus, the tracks themselves must already have a definite size
	so that the items know their [=available space=] during layout.

Intrinsic Tracks and repeat()</h4>

	ISSUE(10915): Should we allow auto-repeated content-based tracks?
	Is this a reasonable definition for them?
	Should they work also in Grid Layout somehow?

	In Grid Layout,
	all [=grid items=] are placed in the grid
	<em>before</em> the grid tracks are sized.
	This implies that ''repeat()/auto-fill''/''repeat()/auto-fit'' repetition
	can't include intrinsically sized tracks such as ''grid-template-rows/auto''
	(either in the ''repeat()'' function <em>or</em> alongside it
	in the fixed portion of the track list),
	as that would require the layout algorithm
	to have already determined which items would go in those tracks,
	to determine how large the tracks are,
	to determine how many repetitions fit in the available space.

	In Masonry Layout,
	as [=masonry item=] placement and layout are intertwined and somewhat simplified,
	this restriction is no longer strictly required.
	It requires a slightly heuristic definition of sizing,
	but auto repetition <em>can</em> include intrinsically-sized tracks
	in a [=masonry container=]
	(and the initial value of 'masonry-template-tracks' uses this!).

	<div algorithm="determine intrinsic repetitions">
		To determine the number of repetitions
		that a ''repeat()'' function resolves to,
		run layout as defined in [[#track-sizing-performance]],
		with the following changes:

		* Expand ''repeat()/auto-fill''/''repeat()/auto-fit'' repeat functions once.
		* Ignore item placement.
			(That is, assume all items have ''masonry-track: auto''.)
		* If a [=masonry item=] has a span larger than 1,
			then for each of its intrinsic sizes
			that it would contribute to the [=virtual masonry item=],
			first subtract the combined size of the gaps it would span,
			and divide by its span.
			Then treat it as being a span-1 item with those sizes.

		Any intrinsically-sized tracks are then treated as having the size
		calculated by this simplified layout
		(including those in ''repeat()'' arguments,
		taking from their corresponding single repetition)
		for the purpose of determining how many repetitions
		the ''repeat()'' functions resolve to.
	</div>

	<details class=note>
		<summary>Motivation</summary>

		This simplified layout heuristic is defined to be "good enough",
		while remaining fast and consistent.

		Ignoring placement is required just to make the concept coherent;
		before you know how many repetitions you need,
		you can't tell what track an item with a definite placement
		will end up in.

		By chopping spanning items into span-1 items,
		this avoids the possible need to expand a repeat() multiple times,
		and the incoherent possibility of getting different sizes
		for the same keyword across the repetitions.

		It also makes the layout as a whole significantly cheaper,
		as you only need to consider each unique track size;
		you don't even <em>really</em> need to do any repeat() expansion.
		That is, in ''auto repeat(auto-fill, min-content auto)'',
		both of the ''grid-template-rows/auto'' keywords
		will resolve to the same size under this heuristic layout;
		you can just figure out what
		a ''masonry-template-tracks: auto''
		and ''masonry-template-tracks: min-content''
		would each result in,
		and use those sizes.

Subgrids</h3>

	[=Subgridding=] allows nested [=masonry containers=] (and [=grid containers=])
	to share track sizes.
	If the parent's corresponding axis is a [=grid axis=],
	the subgridded axis is taken from the parent container
	[[css-grid-2#subgrids|as specified for grid containers]];
	if the parent's corresponding axis is a [=stacking axis=]...

	<section class="option grid">
	<span class="option grid">Grid-integrated Syntax:</span>
	...the subgridded axis acts like ''masonry''.

	Note: If this results in ''grid-template/masonry'' in both axes,
	it is resolved as normal for [=masonry containers=] with double-axis ''grid-template/masonry'' templates,
	i.e. it acts like ''grid-template-columns: none; grid-template-rows: masonry''.
	</section>

	<p class="option masonry"><span class="option masonry">Grid-independent Syntax:</span>
	...the subgridded axis acts like ''grid-template/none''.

	In [=masonry layout=], auto-placed [=subgrids=]
	don't inherit any line names from their parent grid,
	because that would make the placement of the item
	dependent on layout results;
	but the subgrid's tracks are still aligned to the parent's tracks as usual.

	<div class="example">
		Here's a subgrid <a href="examples/subgrid-example-1.html">example</a>:

		```css
		<style>
		.grid {
		  display: inline-grid;
		  grid: auto auto 100px / masonry;
		  align-content: center;
		  height: 300px;
		  border: 1px solid;
		}

		.grid > * {
		  margin: 5px;
		  background: silver;
		}
		.grid > :nth-child(2n) {
		  background: pink;
		}

		.grid subgrid {
		  display: grid;
		  grid: subgrid / subgrid;
		  grid-row: 2 / span 2;
		  grid-gap: 30px;
		}
		.grid subgrid > * { background: cyan; }
		</style>
		```
		```html
		<div class="grid">
		  <item>1</item>
		  <item>2</item>
		  <item>3</item>
		  <subgrid>
		    <item style="height:100px">subgrid.1</item>
		    <item>sub.2</item>
		    <item>s.3</item>
		  </subgrid>
		  <item>4</item>
		  <item>5</item>
		  <item style="width: 80px">6</item>
		  <item>7</item>
		</div>
		```

		<figure>

				The rendering of the subgrid example above.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		Note how the subgrid's first item ("subgrid.1") contributes
		to the intrinsic size of the 2nd row in the parent grid.
		This is possible since the subgrid specified a definite position
		so we know which tracks it will occupy.
		Note also that trying to subgrid the parent's [=stacking axis=]
		results in the subgrid getting [=masonry layout=] in its [=inline axis=].
	</div>

	A [=subgrid=] that is a [=masonry container=]
	can be referred to as a <dfn export>submasonry</dfn>.

<h3 id="repeat-notation">
Track Repetition: the ''repeat()'' notation</h3>

	This specification introduces new keywords and masonry-specific behavior
	for the ''repeat()'' notation.

<h4 id="repeat-auto-areas">
repeat(auto-areas)</h3>

	The new <dfn value for="repeat()">auto-areas</dfn> value for the ''repeat()'' notation
	represents the number of repetitions necessary
	for the total number of explicit tracks to match
	the 'grid-template-areas' / 'masonry-template-areas' value
	in effect in the corresponding axis.
	If multiple tracks are listed for the repetition,
	the final repetition is truncated as necessary
	to produce the correct number of tracks.

	Note: Unlike ''repeat()/auto-fit''--
	which always repeats at least once and always repeats the track listing entirely--
	the number of repetitions for ''repeat()/auto-areas'' can be zero
	(if there are already enough explicit tracks),
	and the final repetition can be partial.

	If 'grid-template-areas' / 'masonry-template-areas' is ''grid-template-areas/none'',
	this value behaves as ''auto-fit''.

	Note: This value applies both to regular [=grid containers=] and to [=masonry containers=].

	ISSUE(10854): It's unclear if we actually need this value.
	Note that the explicit grid already takes values from 'grid-auto-columns'/'grid-auto-rows'/'masonry-auto-tracks'
	as needed to match the number of template areas.

<h4 id="repeat-auto-fit">
repeat(auto-fit)</h3>

	In [=masonry containers=] (as in regular [=grid containers=])
	''repeat()/auto-fit'' acts like ''repeat()/auto-fill'',
	but with empty tracks [=collapsed tracks|collapsed=].
	However, because placement occurs after track sizing,
	[=masonry containers=] use a heuristic
	to determine if a track will be occupied:

	* All tracks occupied by explicitly placed items are considered occupied.
	* With the sum of the spans of all auto-placed items as <var>N</var>,
		all unoccupied tracks up to the <var>N</var>th such track
		are considered occupied.

	All tracks produced by the ''repeat()/auto-fit'' repetition and considered unoccupied by this heuristic
	are assumed “empty” and are [=collapsed tracks|collapsed=].
	A [=collapsed track=] cannot accept placement of auto-placed items.

	Note: It is possible for an auto-placed item to be placed in a track when ''repeat()/auto-fill'' is used
	that would be collapsed if ''repeat()/auto-fit'' is used
	if there are auto-placed items with a span greater than 1
	mixed with explicitly-placed items that leave gaps too small for the auto-placed items.

<h3 id="track-sizing">
Grid Axis Track Sizing</h3>

	Track sizing works the same as in [[css-grid-2#algo-track-sizing|CSS Grid]],
	except that when considering which items contribute to intrinsic sizes:
	* All items explicitly placed in that track contribute, and
	* All items with an [=automatic grid position=] contribute
		(regardless of whether they are ultimately placed in that track).

	<div class="example">
		For example, suppose there are two columns in the [=grid axis=]
		and that
		* Items A, B, and C have no explicit position.
		* Item D is explicitly placed into the first column.

		In this case, items A, B, C, and D all contribute to sizing the first column,
		while only A, B, and C (and not D) contribute to the second column.
	</div>

	In the case of spanning items with an [=automatic grid position=],
	they are assumed to be placed at every possible start position,
	and contribute accordingly.

	<div class="example">
		For example, suppose there are 5 columns in the [=grid axis=],
		with the middle having a fixed size of ''100px''
		and the other two being ''grid-template/auto''-sized.
		For the purpose of track sizing,
		an item that spans 2 tracks
		and has an intrinsic contribution of 220px
		is essentially copied and assumed to exist:

		* At grid line 1,
			contributing 110px to each of the first two tracks.
		* At grid line 2,
			contributing 120px to the second track.
		* At grid line 3,
			contributing 120px to the fourth track.
		* At grid line 4,
			contributing 110px to the fourth and fifth tracks.
	</div>

	Note: This algorithm ensures that each track is at least big enough
	to accommodate every item that is ultimately placed in it,
	and does not create dependency cycles between placement and track sizing.
	However, depending on the variation in sizes,
	tracks could be larger than necessary:
	an exact fit is only guaranteed if
	all items are explicitly placed in the [=grid axis=]
	or all items are the same size
	(or matching multiples of that size, in the case of spanning items).

<h4 id="track-sizing-subgrid">
Subgrid Item Contributions</h4>

	When sizing the tracks of either a regular [=grid container=] or a [=masonry container=],
	a [=submasonry=] has special handling of items that have an [=automatic grid position=]:
	*  Any such item is placed into every possible grid track
		that could be spanned by the [=submasonry=].
		(If the submasonry has a [=definite grid position=], thus only the spanned tracks;
		if it has an [=automatic grid position=], then all tracks in the parent grid.)
	* Any such item receives the largest margin/border/padding contribution
		of each edge at which it could hypothetically be placed.
		If the item spans the entire subgrid, it receives both.
		(See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#subgrid-item-contribution">CSS Grid Layout &sect;9</a>.)

<h4 id="track-sizing-performance">
Optimized Track Sizing</h4>

	Track sizing can be optimized by aggregating items
	that have the same span size and placement
	into a single virtual item
	as follows:

	<ol>
		<li>
			Separate all the [=masonry items=] into <dfn>item groups</dfn>, according to the following properties:

			* the span of the item
			* the placement of the item,
				i.e. which tracks it is allowed to be placed in
			* the item's [=baseline-sharing group=]

			Note: For example, an item with span 2 placed in the second track
			will be in a different group than an item with span 2 that has an [=automatic grid position=].

		<li>
			For each [=item group=], synthesize a <dfn>virtual masonry item</dfn>
			that has the maximum of every intrinsic size contribution
			among the items in that group.

			If the items apply [=baseline alignment=],
			determine the baselines of the [=virtual masonry item=]
			by placing all of its items into a single hypothetical grid track
			and finding their shared baseline(s) and shims.
			Increase the group's intrinsic size contributions accordingly.

		<li>
			Place hypothetical copies of each [=virtual masonry item=] into the [=grid axis=] tracks
			in every position that the item could potentially occupy,
			and run the [[css-grid-2#algo-track-sizing|track sizing algorithm]] with those items.
			The resulting track sizes are the [=masonry container's=] track sizes.
	</ol>

	Note: This optimization should give the same results
	as the track sizing description [[#track-sizing|above]];
	if not this is an error, please
	<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues">report it to the CSSWG</a>.

<h2 id="masonry-track-placement">
Masonry Placement</h3>

	In the [=grid axis=],
	items can be <em>explicitly placed</em> into tracks and span them using the familiar [=grid-placement properties=]’ syntax.
	Auto-placement, however, uses the [[#masonry-layout-algorithm]],
	placing each item with an [=automatic grid position=]
	into the “shortest” masonry track available.

	[=Masonry containers=] are filled

	When multiple tracks are tied for least-filled,
	placing the items in order looks good.
	But if tracks are only <em>very slightly</em> different heights,
	it can look strange to have them not fill in order,
	as the height differences aren't perceived as <em>meaningfully</em> different.

	The 'masonry-slack' property specifies what the threshold is

	causing them to fill in order.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=masonry-slack>

			which can be confusing to readers.
			If the initial value (`1em`) is too small,
			consider a larger value (such as `10em` or `50vh`)
			instead of `infinite`.

	</dl>

	Issue: Is ''1em'' the right default?


<h3 id="masonry-layout-algorithm">
Masonry Layout and Placement Algorithm</h3>

	For each of the tracks in the [=grid axis=],
	keep a <dfn>running position</dfn> initialized to zero.
	Maintain also a <dfn>auto-placement cursor</dfn>,
	initially pointing to the first line.

	For each item in [=order-modified document order=]:
	<ol>
		<li>
			If the item has a [=definite grid position=] in the [=grid axis=],
			use that placement.

			ISSUE: Should this also update the placement cursor?

			Otherwise, resolve its [=grid axis=] placement using these substeps:

			<ol>
				<li>Starting at the first [=grid axis=] line in the [=implicit grid=],
					find the largest [=running position=] of the [=grid axis=] tracks
					that the item would span if it were placed at this line,
					and call this position <var>max_pos</var>.
				<li>Repeat the previous step for each successive line number
					until the item would no longer fit inside the grid.
				<li>Let |possible lines| be the line that resulted in the smallest <var>max_pos</var>,
					and all lines that result in a <var>max_pos</var> within the [=tie threshold=] of this <var>max_pos</var>.
				<li>Choose the first line in |possible lines| greater than or equal to the [=auto-placement cursor=]
					as the item's position in the [=grid axis=];
					or if there are none such, choose the first one.
				<li>Update the [=auto-placement cursor=] to point to item's last line.
			</ol>

		<li>
			Place the item in its [=grid axis=] tracks
			at the maximum of the [=running position=]s
			of the tracks it spans.

		<li>
			Calculate the size of the item's <a href="#containing-block">containing block</a>
			and then layout the item.
			Set the [=running position=] of the spanned  [=grid axis=] tracks
			to <code><var>max_pos</var> + [=outer size=] + 'grid-gap'</code>.
	</ol>

	Note: This algorithm chooses the track
	that would result in the item being placed as highly as possible.
	If there are ties, it chooses the earliest such track,
	<em>after</em> the most recently placed item if possible
	(ensuring that it always “moves forward” even in the presence of ties).

	If placing items in reverse order (see 'grid-auto-flow'/'masonry-flow'),
	the algorithm is analogous but in reverse order.

<h4 id="containing-block">
Containing Block</h2>

	The [=containing block=] for a [=grid item=] participating in [=masonry layout=]
	is formed by its [=grid area=] in the [=grid axis=]
	and the [=grid container=]'s [=content box=] in the [=stacking axis=].

<h4 id="rtl-example">
Placement and Writing Modes</h4>

	Note: Like all of [=grid layout=],
	masonry layout and placement is sensitive to the [=writing mode=].
	For example, for ''direction: rtl'',
	items are placed right-to-left rather than left-to-right,
	whether the inline axis is a [=grid axis=] or a [=stacking axis=].

	The <a>max-content size</a> (<a>min-content size</a>) of a [=grid container=] in the [=stacking axis=]

<h2 id="alignment">
Alignment and Spacing</h2>

	[[css-grid-2#gutters|Gutters]] are supported in both axes.
	In the [=stacking axis=],
	the gap is applied between the margin boxes of each pair of adjacent items.
	Margins do not collapse in either axis.

	In the [=grid axis=],
	[[css-grid-2#alignment|alignment]]
	works the same as in a regular [=grid container=].

	In the [=stacking axis=],
	[[css-align-3#content-distribution|content-distribution]] is applied
	to the content as a whole, similarly to how it behaves in block containers.
	More specifically, the <a>alignment subject</a> is the <dfn>masonry box</dfn>,
	which is the smallest rectangle bounding
	the [=margin boxes=] of all the [=grid items=].

	<figure>
		<img src="images/masonry-box.png">
		<figcaption>
			The extent of the [=masonry box=] is indicated by the dashed border.
			(Note that item 1 has a 5px bottom margin here.)
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	Note: There is only ever one <a>alignment subject</a>
	for these properties in the [=stacking axis=],
	so the unique 'align-content' / 'justify-content' values boil down to
	''align-content/start'',
	''align-content/center'',
	''align-content/end'',
	and [=baseline alignment=].
	(The behavior of ''align-content/normal'' and ''align-content/stretch''
	is identical to ''align-content/start'',
	and the [=distributed alignment=] values behave as their [=fallback alignments=].)
	If the [=grid items=] overflow
	the [=grid container=]'s [=content box=] in the [=stacking axis=],
	then the [=masonry box=] will be larger than the [=grid container=]'s [=content box=].

	ISSUE: Should alignment in the stacking axis do something more sophisticated?
	What should that be?

<h3 id="masonry-axis-baseline-alignment">
Baseline Alignment in the stacking axis</h3>

	Item [=baseline alignment=] inside the [=grid axis=] tracks

	is generated from the [=alignment baseline=] of
	the first [=grid item=] in the first occupied track,
	and the last baseline set from the last [=grid item=] placed.

	ISSUE: We could support baseline alignment in the first row. Do we want to?

	ISSUE: Should the last baseline come from the last lowest item placed instead?

<h2 id="pagination">
Fragmentation</h2>

<h3 id="masonry-axis-pagination">
Fragmentation in the stacking axis</h3>

	Each [=grid axis=] track is fragmented independently in the [=stacking axis=].
	If a [=grid item=] is fragmented,
	or has a [=forced break=] before/after it,
	then the [=running position=] for the tracks that it spans in the [=grid axis=]
	are set to the size of the [=fragmentainer=]
	so that no further items will be placed in those tracks.
	An item that is split into multiple fragments
	retains its placement in the [=grid axis=] for all its fragments.
	A grid item that is pushed, however,
	is placed again by the next [=grid container=] fragment.
	Placement continues until all items are placed or pushed to a new fragment.

	<div class="example">
		Here's an <a href="examples/fragmentation-block-axis-example.html">example</a>
		illustrating fragmentation of a grid with masonry layout in its [=block axis=].
		It renders like this:
		<figure style="max-width:100%">
			<video style="max-width:100%" src="images/fragmentation-block-axis-example.mp4" controls></video>
			<figcaption>
				Visualization of fragmentation in a [=block-axis=] [=masonry layout=].

		</figure>
	</div>

<h3 id="grid-axis-pagination">
Fragmentation in the Grid Axis</h3>

	Fragmentation in the [=grid axis=] with [=masonry layout=] in the other axis
	is also supported.
	In this case the fragmentation behaves more like in a regular [=grid container=];
	however, there's a separate step to determine which [=grid-axis=] track
	each item is placed into,
	before fragmentation occurs.

	<div class="example">
		Here's an <a href="examples/fragmentation-inline-axis-example.html">example</a>
		illustrating fragmentation of a grid with [=masonry layout=] in its [=inline axis=].
		In this case the breaks occurs between the [=grid-axis=] rows.
		It renders like this:
		<figure style="max-width:100%">
			<video style="max-width:100%" src="images/fragmentation-inline-axis-example.mp4" controls></video>
			<figcaption>
				Visualization of fragmentation in the [=block axis=] with [=inline-axis=] [=masonry layout=].
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>

<h2 id="abspos">
Absolute Positioning</h2>

	[[css-grid-1#abspos-items|Grid-aligned absolute-positioned descendants]] are supported
	in [=masonry containers=] just as for regular [=grid containers=];
	however, in the [=stacking axis=] there exist only two lines (in addition to the ''grid-area/auto'' lines) for placement:

	* line 1 (line -2) corresponds to the start edge of the [=masonry box=]
	* line 2 (line -1) corresponds to the end edge of the [=masonry box=]

	ISSUE: It might be useful to define a static position in the [=stacking axis=].
	Maybe it could defined as the max (or min?) current [=running position=]
	of the [=grid-axis=] tracks at that point?  Or the end of the item before it?

<h2 id="graceful-degradation">
Graceful Degradation</h2>

	Typically, a masonry design can be expected to degrade quite nicely
	in a UA that supports Grid layout but not masonry layout
	if the 'grid'/'grid-template' shorthands are avoided
	and the longhands are used instead. e.g.
	```css
	  grid-template-rows: masonry; /* ignored by UAs that don't support it */
	  grid-template-columns: 150px 100px 50px;
	```

	<div class="example">
		Here's an <a href="examples/graceful-degradation-example.html">example</a>
		to illustrate this.
		It's a layout with three columns,
		but will have "more gaps" in the [=block axis=] if the UA doesn't support masonry layout.
		Here's what it looks like with Masonry support for comparison:

Recent Changes</h3>

	The following changes have been made since the
	<a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/WD-css-grid-3-20240919/'>First Public Working Draft</a>:

	* Drafted ability to mix ''auto-fill''/''auto-fit'' ''repeat()'' values with content-based track sizes
		in the [=grid-independent option=] and made it the initial behavior 'masonry-template-tracks'.
		(Issues <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10915">10915</a>,
		and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10869">10869</a>)
	* Added ''masonry-slack: infinite''.
		(<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10883">Issue 10883</a>)
	* Minor corrections, updated acknowledgements, and added an example.
