Introduction {#intro}
=====================

CSS [=absolute positioning=] allows authors
to place elements anywhere on the page,
without regard to the layout of other elements
besides their containing block.
This flexibility can be very useful,
but also very limiting--
often you want to position relative to <em>some</em> other element.
<dfn export>Anchor positioning</dfn>
(via the <dfn export>anchor functions</dfn> ''anchor()'' and ''anchor-size()'')
allows authors to achieve this,
"anchoring" an [=absolutely-positioned=] element
to one or more other elements on the page,
while also allowing them to try several possible positions
to find the "best" one that avoids overlap/overflow.

For example, an author might want to position a tooltip
centered and above the targeted element,
unless that would place the tooltip offscreen,
in which case it should be below the targeted element.
This can be done with the following CSS:

<div class=example>
	<pre class=lang-css>
	.anchor {
		anchor-name: --tooltip;
	}
	.tooltip {
		/* Fixpos means we don't need to worry about
		   containing block relationships;
		   the tooltip can live anywhere in the DOM. */
		position: fixed;

		/* All the anchoring behavior will default to
		   referring to the --tooltip anchor. */
		anchor-default: --tooltip;

		/* Align the tooltip's bottom to the top of the anchor,
		   but automatically swap if this overflows the window
		   to the tooltip's top aligns to the anchor's bottom
		   instead. */
		bottom: anchor(auto);

		/* Set up a 300px-wide area, centered on the anchor.
		   If centering would put part of it off-screen,
		   instead clamp it to remain on-screen. */
		left: clamp(0px, anchor(center) - 150px, 100% - 300px);
		right: clamp(0px, anchor(center) - 150px, 100% - 300px);
		max-width: 300px;

		/* Center the tooltip in that area. */
		justify-self: center;
	}
	</pre>
</div>

Creating An Anchor: the 'anchor-name' property {#name}
----------------------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: anchor-name
Value: none | <<dashed-ident>>
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Applies to: all elements that generate a [=principal box=]
Animation Type: discrete
</pre>

The 'anchor-name' property declares
that an element is an <dfn local-lt=anchor>anchor element</dfn>,
and gives it an <dfn>anchor name</dfn> to be targeted by.
Values are defined as follows:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=anchor-name>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	:: The property has no effect.

	: <dfn><<dashed-ident>></dfn>
	:: If the element generates a [=principal box=],
		the element is an [=anchor element=],
		with an [=anchor name=] equal to the <<dashed-ident>>.
		The [=anchor name=] is a [=tree-scoped name=].

		Otherwise, the property has no effect.
</dl>

[=Anchor names=] do not need to be unique.
Not all elements are capable of being [=anchor elements=]
for a given positioned element,
so a name can be reused in multiple places
if the usages are scoped appropriately.
If there are still multiple valid [=anchor elements=]
with the given [=anchor name=],
the last one is chosen.

### Implicit Anchor Elements ### {#implicit}

Some specifications can define that,
in certain circumstances,
a particular element is an <dfn>implicit anchor element</dfn>
for a given positioned element.

<p class=example>
	For example, the HTML spec defines an <{html-global/anchor}> attribute
	which allows an element to declare what element it is anchored to. 
	This makes the declared element the [=implicit anchor element=]
	for the element with the attribute.

[=Implicit anchor elements=] can be referenced
with the ''implicit'' keyword,
rather than referring to some 'anchor-name' value.

A ''::before'', ''::after'' or ''::backdrop'' [=pseudo-element=]
has the same [=implicit anchor element=]
as its [=originating element=].

Note: Without this, these [=pseudo-elements=], which are often inaccessible
by other specifications, cannot be positioned with [=implicit anchor elements=].

Finding An Anchor {#target}
-----------------

Several things in this specification
find a [=target anchor element=],
given an <dfn>anchor specifier</dfn>,
which is either a <<dashed-ident>>
(and a [=tree-scoped reference=])
that should match an 'anchor-name' value elsewhere on the page,
or the keyword ''implicit'',
or nothing (a missing specifier).

<div algorithm>
	To determine the <dfn>target [=anchor element=]</dfn>
	given a querying element |query el|
	and an optional [=anchor specifier=] |anchor spec|:

	1. If |anchor spec| was not passed,
		return the [=target anchor element=]
		for |query el|
		given the |query el|'s [=default anchor specifier=].

	2. If |anchor spec| is ''implicit'',
		and the Popover API defines an [=implicit anchor element=] for |query el|
		which is an [=acceptable anchor element=] for |query el|,
		return that element.

		Otherwise, return nothing.

		Note: Future APIs might also define implicit anchor elements.
		When they do, they'll be explicitly handled in this algorithm,
		to ensure coordination.

	3. Otherwise, |anchor spec| is a <<dashed-ident>>.
		Return the last element |el| in tree order
		that satisfies the following conditions:

		* |el| is an [=anchor element=] with an [=anchor name=] of |anchor spec|.

		* |el|'s [=anchor name=] and |anchor spec| are both associated with the same [=tree=] [=tree/root=].

			Note: The [=anchor name=] is a [=tree-scoped name=],
			while |anchor spec| is a [=tree-scoped reference=].

		* |el| is an [=acceptable anchor element=] for |query el|.

		If no element satisfies these conditions,
		return nothing.

	Note: The general rule captured by these conditions
	is that |el| must be fully laid out
	before |query el| is laid out.
	CSS's rules about the layout order of stacking contexts
	give us assurances about this,
	and the list of conditions above
	exactly rephrases the stacking context rules
	into just what's relevant for this purpose,
	ensuring there is no possibly circularity
	in anchor positioning.

	Note: An 'anchor-name' defined by styles in one [=shadow tree=]
	won't be seen by [=anchor functions=] in styles in a different [=shadow tree=],
	preserving encapsulation.
	However, <em>elements</em> in different [=shadow trees=]
	can still anchor to each other,
	so long as both the 'anchor-name' and [=anchor function=]
	come from styles in the same tree,
	such as by using ''::part()'' to style an element inside a shadow.
	([=Implicit anchor elements=] also aren't intrinsically limited to a single tree,
	but the details of that will depend on the API assigning them.)
</div>

<div algorithm="acceptable anchor element">
	An element |el| is a <dfn export>acceptable anchor element</dfn>
	for an [=absolutely positioned=] element |query el|
	if all of the following are true:

	* Either |el| is a descendant of |query el|'s [=containing block=],
		or |query el|'s [=containing block=] is the [=initial containing block=].

	* If |el| has the same [=containing block=] as |query el|,
		then either |el| is not [=absolutely positioned=],
		or |el| precedes |query el| in the tree order.

	* If |el| has a different [=containing block=] from |query el|,
		then the last [=containing block=] in |el|'s [=containing block chain=]
		before reaching |query el|'s [=containing block=]
		is either not [=absolutely positioned=]
		or precedes |query el| in the tree order.
</div>

<h3 id=anchor-default>
Default Anchors: the 'anchor-default' property</h3>

<pre class=propdef>
Name: anchor-default
Value: <<anchor-element>>
Initial: implicit
Applies to: [=absolutely positioned=] elements
Inherited: no
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

The 'anchor-default' property defines the <dfn>default anchor specifier</dfn>
for all [=anchor functions=] on the element,
allowing multiple elements to use the same set of [=anchor functions=]
(and [=position fallback lists=]!)
while changing which [=anchor element=] each is referring to.

Its values are identical to the <<anchor-element>> term
in ''anchor()'' and ''anchor-size()''.

<div class=example>
	For example, in the following code
	both ''.foo'' and ''.bar'' elements
	can use the same positioning properties and fallback,
	just changing the anchor element they're referring to:

	<pre highlight=css>
	.anchored {
		position: absolute;
		position-fallback: --under-then-over;
	}

	@position-fallback --under-then-over {
		@try {
			// No <anchor-element> specified,
			// so it takes from 'anchor-default'.
			top: calc(.5em + anchor(auto));
			bottom: auto;
		}
	}

	.foo.anchored {
		anchor-default: --foo;
	}
	.bar.anchored {
		anchor-default: --bar;
	}
	</pre>
</div>

Anchor-Based Positioning {#positioning}
========================

An [=absolutely-positioned=] element
can use the <dfn>anchor()</dfn> function
in its [=inset properties=]
to refer to the position of one or more [=anchor elements=].
The ''anchor()'' function resolves to a <<length>>,
exactly what is needed to position the given inset edge
to the specified position on the [=anchor element=].

The ''anchor()'' Function {#anchor-pos}
---------------------------------------------------

An [=absolutely-positioned=] element
can use the ''anchor()'' function
as a value in its [=inset properties=]
to refer to the position of one or more [=anchor elements=].
The ''anchor()'' function resolves to a <<length>>.

<pre class=prod>
	&lt;anchor()> = anchor( <<anchor-element>>? <<anchor-side>>, <<length-percentage>>? )
	<dfn><<anchor-element>></dfn> = <<dashed-ident>> | implicit
	<dfn><<anchor-side>></dfn> = auto | auto-same
	           | top | left | right | bottom
	           | start | end | self-start | self-end
	           | <<percentage>> | center
</pre>

The ''anchor()'' function has three arguments:

* the <<anchor-element>> value
	specifies how to find the [=anchor element=]
	it will be drawing positioning information from.
	If omitted, it behaves as the element's [=default anchor specifier=].
	Its possible values are:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="anchor()">
		: <dfn><<dashed-ident>></dfn>
		:: Specifies the [=anchor name=] it will look for.
			This name is a [=tree-scoped reference=].

		: <dfn>implicit</dfn>
		:: Selects the [=implicit anchor element=]
			defined for the element,
			if possible.
	</dl>

	See [=target anchor element=] for details.

* the <<anchor-side>> value
	refers to the position of the corresponding side
	of the [=target anchor element=].
	Its possible values are:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="anchor()">
		: <dfn>auto</dfn>
		: <dfn>auto-same</dfn>
		:: Resolves to one of the [=anchor element's=] sides,
			depending on which [=inset property=] it's used in.
			Also triggers automatic fallback behavior.

			See [[#anchor-auto]] for more details.

		: <dfn>top</dfn>
		: <dfn>right</dfn>
		: <dfn>bottom</dfn>
		: <dfn>left</dfn>
		:: Refers to the specified side of the [=anchor element=].

			Note: These are only usable in the [=inset properties=]
			in the matching axis.
			For example, ''left'' is usable in 'left', 'right',
			or the logical [=inset properties=] that refer to the horizontal axis.

		: <dfn>start</dfn>
		: <dfn>end</dfn>
		: <dfn>self-start</dfn>
		: <dfn>self-end</dfn>
		:: Refers to one of the sides of the [=anchor element=]
			in the same axis as the [=inset property=] it's used in,
			by resolving the keyword against the [=writing mode=]
			of either the positioned element
			(for ''self-start'' and ''self-end'')
			or the positioned element's containing block
			(for ''start'' and ''end'').

		: <dfn><<percentage>></dfn>
		: <dfn>center</dfn>
		:: Refers to a position
			a corresponding percentage between the ''start'' and ''end'' sides,
			with ''0%'' being equivalent to ''start''
			and ''100%'' being equivalent to ''end''.

			''center'' is equivalent to ''50%''.

* the optional <<length-percentage>> final argument is a fallback value,
	specifying what the function should resolve to
	if it's an [=invalid anchor function=].

Issue: Computed value for anchor()
probably needs to be the anchor() function,
but with the target anchor element resolved.
This allows for transitions to work properly
with tree-scoped names,
and with changing anchor elements.
See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8180">Issue 8180</a>.

An ''anchor()'' function representing a [=valid anchor function=]
resolves at [=used value=] time
to the <<length>> that would align the edge
of the positioned elements' [=inset-modified containing block=]
corresponding to the property the function appears in
with the specified border edge of the [=target anchor element=],
assuming that all [=scroll containers=]
between the [=target anchor element=]
and the positioned element's [=containing block=]
are scrolled to their initial scroll position
(but see 'anchor-scroll').

If the [=target anchor element=] is [=fragmented=],
the axis-aligned bounding rectangle
of the fragments' border boxes is used instead.

Issue: Do we need to control which box we're referring to,
so you can align to padding or content edge?

If the positioned element
has a [=snapshotted scroll offset=],
then it is additionally visually shifted
by those offsets,
as if by an additional ''translate()'' transform.

<div class=example>
	For example,
	in ''.bar { top: anchor(--foo top); }'',
	the ''anchor()'' will resolve to the length
	that'll line up the <code>.bar</code> element's top edge
	with the ''--foo'' anchor's top edge.

	On the other hand,
	in ''.bar { bottom: anchor(--foo top); }'',
	it will instead resolve to the length
	that'll line up the <code>.bar</code> element's <em>bottom</em> edge
	with the ''--foo'' anchor's top edge.

	Since 'top' and 'bottom' values specify insets from different edges
	(the top and bottom of the element's [=containing block=],
	respectively),
	the same ''anchor()'' will usually resolve to different lengths in each.
</div>

<div class=example>
	Because the ''anchor()'' function resolves to a <<length>>,
	it can be used in [=math functions=] like any other length.

	For example, the following will set up the element
	so that its [=inset-modified containing block=]
	is centered on the [=anchor element=]
	and as wide as possible without overflowing the [=containing block=]:

	<pre highlight=css>
	.centered-message {
		position: fixed;
		max-width: max-content;
		justify-self: center;

		--center: anchor(--x 50%);
		--half-distance: min(
			abs(0% - var(--center)),
			abs(100% - var(--center))
		);
		left: calc(var(--center) - var(--half-distance));
		right: calc(var(--center) - var(--half-distance));
		bottom: anchor(--x top);
	}
	</pre>

	This might be appropriate for an error message
	on an <{input}> element,
	for example,
	as the centering will make it easier to discover
	which input is being referred to.
</div>

<h4 id=anchor-auto>
Automatic Anchor Positioning</h4>

The ''auto'' and ''auto-same'' <<anchor-side>> keywords
indicate the element wants to use
<dfn>automatic anchor positioning</dfn>
in that property's axis.
This has two effects:

* The ''anchor()'' function will automatically refer to
	the expected side of the [=anchor element=]
	(the same side as the [=inset property=] it's used in,
	for ''auto-same'',
	or the opposite side,
	for ''auto'').

	That is, ''top: anchor(auto);'' is equivalent to ''top: anchor(bottom);'',
	while ''left: anchor(auto-same);'' is equivalent to ''left: anchor(left);'',
	etc.
* If the element has ''position-fallback: none'',
	and the opposite [=inset property=] is ''top/auto'',
	it automatically gains a [=position fallback list=]
	that will flip it to the opposite side of the [=anchor element=]
	if necessary.
	See [[#fallback-automatic]] for details.

<div class=example>
	For example, to position and size an element
	to exactly cover the target element:

	<pre class=lang-css>
	.cover {
		inset: anchor(auto-same);
	}
	</pre>

	is equivalent to

	<pre class=lang-css>
	.cover {
		top: anchor(top);
		right: anchor(right);
		bottom: anchor(bottom);
		left: anchor(left);
	}
	</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
	When the opposite axis is ''top/auto'',
	the element automatically gains fallback behavior.
	For example:

	<pre class=lang-css>
	.tooltip {
		position: fixed;
		anchor-default: --target;
		top: auto; /* initial value */
		bottom: calc(anchor(auto) + .3em);
	}
	</pre>

	With the above code,
	the tooltip will default to positioning its bottom edge
	slightly away from the top edge of its anchor element,
	hovering just above it;
	but if that would make it overflow the top edge of the screen
	(aka the top of its [=inset-modified containing block=],
	which is the viewport in this case),
	it will automatically flip to the opposite side,
	as if you'd instead specified:

	<pre class=lang-css>
	.tooltip {
		position: fixed;
		position-fallback: --top-then-bottom;
		anchor-default: --target;
	}
	@position-fallback --top-then-bottom {
		@try {
			top: auto;
			bottom: calc(anchor(top) + .3em);
		}
		@try {
			top: calc(anchor(bottom) + .3em);
			bottom: auto;
		}
	}
	</pre>

	If both axises trigger this behavior,
	it effectively gains four fallbacks,
	trying each combination of specified and opposing anchors
	to find one that won't trigger overflow.
</div>

Taking Scroll Into Account: the 'anchor-scroll' property {#scroll}
------------------------------------------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: anchor-scroll
Value: none | default | <<anchor-element>>
Initial: default
Inherited: no
Applies to: [=absolutely-positioned=] elements
Animation Type: discrete
</pre>

Because scrolling is often done in a separate thread from layout in implementations for performance reasons,
but ''anchor()'' can result in both positioning changes
(which can be handled in the scrolling thread)
and layout changes
(which cannot),
''anchor()'' is defined to assume
all the [=scroll containers=] between the anchor element
and the positioned element's containing block
are at their initial scroll position.
This means a positioned element
will <em>not</em> be aligned with its anchor
if any of the scrollers are <em>not</em> at their initial positions.

The 'anchor-scroll' property allows an author to compensate for this,
without losing the performance benefits of the separate scrolling thread,
so long as the positioned element
is only anchoring to a single anchor element.
Its values are:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=anchor-scroll>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	:: No effect.

	: <dfn>default</dfn>
	:: Behaves identically to <<anchor-element>>,
		but draws its value from 'anchor-default' on the element.

	: <dfn><<anchor-element>></dfn>
	::
		Selects a [=target anchor element=]
		the same as ''anchor()'',
		which will be compensated for in positioning and fallback.
</dl>

Note: When the element uses 'anchor-default'
or has an [=implicit anchor element=],
authors can often avoid explicitly setting an 'anchor-scroll' value
because the initial value is ''anchor-scroll/default''.

<div algorithm="compensate for scroll">
	If 'anchor-scroll' is not ''anchor-scroll/none''
	on an [=absolutely-positioned=] element |query el|,
	and there is a [=target anchor element=] for |query el|
	given the 'anchor-scroll' value,
	and at least one ''anchor()'' function on |query el|
	refers to the same [=target anchor element=],
	then |query el| has a <dfn>snapshotted scroll offset</dfn>,
	which is a pair of lengths
	representing a vertical and horizontal offset.

	The [=snapshotted scroll offset=]
	is the sum of the offsets from the [=initial scroll position=]
	of all [=scroll container=] ancestors of the [=target anchor element=],
	up to but not including |query el|'s [=containing block=].

	Issue: Define the precise timing of the snapshot:
	updated each frame,
	before style recalc.

	If |query el| has an [=additional fallback-bounds rect=],
	similarly calculate the sum of the offsets from the [=initial scroll position=]
	of all [=scroll container=] ancestors
	of the element generating the [=additional fallback-bounds rect=],
	and subtract that summed offset
	from the [=additional fallback-bounds rect's=] position.
</div>


Validity {#anchor-valid}
--------

An ''anchor()'' function is a
<dfn lt="valid anchor function|invalid anchor function">valid anchor function</dfn>
only if all the following conditions are true:

* It's being used in an [=inset property=]
	on an [=absolutely-positioned=] element.
* If its <<anchor-side>> specifies a physical keyword,
	it's being used in an [=inset property=] in that axis.
	(For example, ''left'' can only be used in 'left', 'right',
	or a logical [=inset property=] in the horizontal axis.)
* There is a [=target anchor element=]
	for the element it's used on,
	and the <<anchor-element>> value specified in the function.

If any of these conditions are false,
the ''anchor()'' function resolves to its specified fallback value.
If no fallback value is specified,
it resolves to ''0px''.

Anchor-based Sizing {#sizing}
===================

An [=absolutely-positioned=] element
can use the <dfn>anchor-size()</dfn> function
in its [=sizing properties=]
to refer to the size of one or more [=anchor elements=].
The ''anchor-size()'' function resolves to a <<length>>.

The ''anchor-size()'' Function {#anchor-size-fn}
------------------------------

<pre class=prod>
anchor-size() = anchor( <<anchor-element>>? <<anchor-size>>, <<length-percentage>>? )
<dfn><<anchor-size>></dfn> = width | height | block | inline | self-block | self-inline
</pre>

The ''anchor-size()'' function is similar to ''anchor()'',
and takes the same arguments,
save that the <<anchor-side>> keywords are replaced with <<anchor-size>>,
referring to the distance between two opposing sides.

The physical <<anchor-size>> keywords
(<dfn value for=anchor-size()>width</dfn>
and <dfn value for=anchor-size()>height</dfn>)
refer to the width and height,
respectively,
of the [=target anchor element=].
Unlike ''anchor()'', there is no restriction on having to match axises;
for example, ''width: anchor-size(--foo height);'' is valid.

The logical <<anchor-size>> keywords
(<dfn value for=anchor-size()>block</dfn>,
<dfn value for=anchor-size()>inline</dfn>,
<dfn value for=anchor-size()>self-block</dfn>,
and <dfn value for=anchor-size()>self-inline</dfn>)
map to one of the physical keywords
according to either the [=writing mode=] of the element
(for ''self-block'' and ''self-inline'')
or the [=writing mode=] of the element's [=containing block=]
(for ''anchor-size()/block'' and ''anchor-size()/inline'').

An ''anchor-size()'' function representing a [=valid anchor-size function=]
resolves to the <<length>> separating the relevant border edges
(either left and right, or top and bottom,
whichever is in the specified axis)
of the [=target anchor element=].

Validity {#anchor-size-valid}
--------

An ''anchor-size()'' function is a
<dfn lt="valid anchor-size function|invalid anchor-size function">valid anchor-size function</dfn>
only if all the following conditions are true:

* It's being used in a [=sizing property=]
	on an [=absolutely-positioned=] element.
* There is a [=target anchor element=]
	for the element it's used on,
	and the <<anchor-element>> value specified in the function.

If any of these conditions are false,
the ''anchor-size()'' function resolves to its specified fallback value.
If no fallback value is specified,
it resolves to ''0px''.

Fallback Sizing/Positioning {#fallback}
===========================

Anchor positioning,
while powerful,
can also be unpredictable.
The [=anchor element=] might be anywhere on the page,
so positioning an element in any particular fashion
(such as above the anchor, or the right of the anchor)
might result in the positioned element overflowing its [=containing block=]
or being positioned partially off screen.

To ameliorate this, an [=absolutely positioned=] element
can use the 'position-fallback' property
to refer to a ''@position-fallback'' block,
giving a list of possible style rules to try out.
Each is applied to the element, one by one,
and the first that doesn't cause the element
to overflow its [=containing block=]
is taken as the winner.

The 'position-fallback' Property {#fallback-property}
--------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: position-fallback
Value: none | <<dashed-ident>>
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Applies to: [=absolutely-positioned=] elements
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

Values have the following meanings:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=position-fallback>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	:: The property has no effect;
		the element does not use a [=position fallback list=].

	: <dfn><<dashed-ident>></dfn>
	:: If there is a ''@position-fallback'' rule
		with a name matching the specified ident,
		then the element uses that [=position fallback list=].

		Otherwise,
		this value has no effect.
</dl>

The ''@position-fallback'' Rule {#fallback-rule}
-------------------------------

The <dfn>@position-fallback</dfn> rule
defines a [=position fallback list=]
with a given name,
specifying one or more sets of positioning properties
inside of <dfn>@try</dfn> blocks
that will be applied to an element,
with each successive one serving as fallback
if the previous would cause the element
to partially or fully overflow its [=containing block=].

The grammar of the ''@position-fallback'' rule is:

<pre class=prod>
@position-fallback <<dashed-ident>> {
	<<rule-list>>
}

@try { <<declaration-list>> }
</pre>

The ''@position-fallback'' rule only accepts ''@try'' rules.
The <<dashed-ident>> specified in the prelude
is the rule's name.
If multiple ''@position-fallback'' rules are declared with the same name,
the last one in document order "wins".

The ''@try'' rule only accepts the following [=properties=]:

* [=inset properties=]
* [=sizing properties=]
* [=box alignment properties=]

Issue: What exactly are the constraints that determine what's allowed here?
Current list is based off of what's reasonable
from Chrome's experimental impl.
We can make a CQ that keys off of which fallback was used
to allow more general styling,
at least for descendants.

The ''@try'' rules inside a ''@position-fallback''
specify a <dfn>position fallback list</dfn>,
where each entry consists of the properties specified by each ''@try'',
in order.

Issue: Would be useful to be able to detect
when your anchor(s) are fully off-screen
and suppress your display entirely.
For example, tooltips living outside the scroller
holding the text they're anchored to
don't want to just hover over arbitrary parts of the page
because their anchor happens to have that position
relative to the scrollport.

Note: If multiple elements using different anchors
want to use the same fallback positioning,
just relative to their own anchor elements,
omit the <<anchor-element>> in ''anchor()''
and specify each element's anchor in 'anchor-default' instead.

Note: The most common types of fallback positioning
(putting the positioned element on one side of the anchor normally,
but flipping to the opposite side if needed)
can be done automatically,
without using ''@position-fallback'' at all,
by using ''anchor()/auto'' or ''anchor()/auto-side''
side values in the ''anchor()'' function.

Applying Stronger Fallback Bounds: the 'position-fallback-bounds' property {#fallback-bounds}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an element using [=anchor positioning=]
is using ''position: absolute'',
it determines whether or not it's overflowing
(and thus should try a different fallback position)
by looking at its (scroll-adjusted) [=inset-modified containing block=].
By carefully selecting where in the DOM
the positioned element lives,
and what element establishes its containing block,
you can choose a useful element
to use for its overflow bounds.

When using ''position: fixed'',
or things like the Popover API
that use the [=top layer=],
you lose this ability;
their containing block is always the viewport
or the root element's containing block.
The 'position-fallback-bounds' property
restores this ability,
allowing an element to explicitly select
what element it wants to use
for checking overflow against.

<pre class=propdef>
Name: position-fallback-bounds
Value: normal | <<dashed-ident>>
Initial: normal
Applies to: [=absolutely positioned=] elements
Inherited: no
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=position-fallback-bounds>
	: <dfn>normal</dfn>
	:: The element uses its normal (scroll-adjusted, inset-modified) containing block
		to determine if it's overflowing
		for the purpose of selecting a [=position fallback list=] entry.

	: <<dashed-ident>>
	::
		In addition to checking overflow against its containing block,
		as per ''position-fallback-bounds/normal'',
		the element checks against its <dfn dfn for>additional fallback-bounds rect</dfn>.

		The [=additional fallback-bounds rect=]
		is the [=padding box=]
		of the [=target anchor element=]
		given this element and the specified <<dashed-ident>>.
		If there is no such [=target anchor element=],
		there is no [=additional fallback-bounds rect=].

		Issue: padding-box? Or content-box? Should it be controllable?
</dl>


Applying Position Fallback {#fallback-apply}
--------------------------

When an element uses a [=position fallback list=],
it selects one entry from the list
as defined below,
and applies those properties to itself as [=used values=].

Note: These have to be applied as used values
because we're in the middle of layout right now;
defining how they'd interact with the cascade
would be extremely confusing *at a minimum*,
and perhaps actually circular.
In any case, not worth the cost in spec or impl.

Issue: This implies that the values can't be transitioned in the usual fashion,
since transitions key off of computed values
and we're past that point.
However, popovers sliding between positions is a common effect in UI libs.
Probably should introduce a <css>smooth</css> keyword
to 'position-fallback'
to trigger automatic "animation" of the fallback'd properties.

<div algorithm>
	To <dfn>determine the position fallback styles</dfn> of an element |el|:

	1. Let |base styles| be the current used styles of |el|.

	2. [=list/For each=] |fallback styles| in the [=position fallback list=]:

		1. Apply the styles in |fallback styles| to |el|,
			overriding the corresponding properties in |base styles|.

			Perform any specified/computed/used-value time normalizations
			that are required to make the overridden styles into [=used values=]
			(such as resolving [=math functions=], etc).

			Let |adjusted styles|
			be |el|'s styles after these adjustments.

		2. If |el| has a [=snapshotted scroll offset=],
			then subtract the offsets
			from |el|'s margin box's position.

			Also, if any of |el|'s [=inset properties=] are non-auto,
			subtract the [=snapshotted scroll offset=] for the appropriate axis
			from their values.
			Recalculate |el|'s [=inset-modified containing block=]
			using these shifted values
			to obtain the |scroll-adjusted IMCB|.

		3. If |el|'s [=margin box=] is not fully contained
			within the |scroll-adjusted IMCB|,
			[=iteration/continue=].

		4. If |el| has an [=additional fallback-bounds rect=],
			and |el|'s [=margin box=] is not fully contained within it,
			[=iteration/continue=].

		5. Use |adjusted styles| for |el|
			and exit this algorithm.

	3. If the previous step finished without selecting a set of styles,
		use the |adjusted styles|
		corresponding to the final entry in the [=position fallback list=].

	Note: Descendants overflowing |el|
	don't affect this calculation,
	only |el|'s own [=margin box=].
</div>

The styles returned by [=determining the position fallback styles=]
are taken as the final values for the specified properties.

Implementations may choose to impose an implementation-defined limit
on the length of [=position fallback lists=],
to limit the amount of excess layout work that may be required.
This limit must be <em>at least</em> five.

<div class=issue>
	Nested anchors
	(an anchored element inside of another anchored element)
	present the potential for exponential blow-up of layouts
	when doing fallback,
	since the grandchild anchored element can cause scrollbars on an ancestor,
	changing the IMCB for the child anchored element,
	thus possibly causing the fallback choice to change for it.

	There are strategies to avoid this,
	but they're not without costs of their own.
	We should <em>probably</em> impose a <strong>maximum</strong> limit as well,
	to avoid this.

	However, since *most* usages won't be problematic in the first place,
	we don't want to restrict them unduly
	just to prevent weird situations from exploding.
	Perhaps a complexity budget based on the branching factor at each level?
	Like, accumulate the product of the fallback list lengths from ancestors,
	and your fallback list gets limited to not exceed a total product
	of, say, 1k.
	Get too deep and you're stuck with your first choice only!
	But this would allow large, complex fallback lists for top-level stuff,
	and even some reasonable nesting.
	(Length-five lists could be nested to depth of 4, for example,
	if we did go with 1k.)

	More thought is needed.
</div>

<div class=example>
	For example,
	the following CSS will first attempt to position a "popover"
	below the [=element=],
	but if it doesn't fit on-screen will switch to being above;
	it defaults to left-aligning,
	but will switch to right-aligning if that doesn't fit.

	<pre highlight=css>
	#myPopover {
		position: fixed;
		position-fallback: --button-popover;
		overflow: auto;

		/* The popover is at least as wide as the button */
		min-width: anchor-size(--button width);

		/* The popover is at least as tall as 2 menu items */
		min-height: 6em;
	}

	@position-fallback --button-popover {
		/* First try to align the top, left edge of the popover
		with the bottom, left edge of the button. */
		@try {
			top: anchor(--button bottom);
			left: anchor(--button left);
		}

		/* Next try to align the bottom, left edge of the popover
		with the top, left edge of the button. */
		@try {
			bottom: anchor(--button top);
			left: anchor(--button left);
		}

		/* Next try to align the top, right edge of the popover
		with the bottom, right edge of the button. */
		@try {
			top: anchor(--button bottom);
			right: anchor(--button right);
		}

		/* Finally, try to align the bottom, right edge of the popover
		with the top, right edge of the button. Other positions are possible,
		but this is the final option the author would like the rendering
		engine to try. */
		@try {
			bottom: anchor(--button top);
			right: anchor(--button right);
		}
	}
	</pre>
</div>



Fallback and Automatic Positioning {#fallback-automatic}
----------------------------------

When an element uses an ''anchor()'' function
with an ''auto'' or ''auto-same'' <<anchor-side>> argument
in an [=inset property=],
and the opposite [=inset property=] is ''top/auto'',
the element is said to be trying to use <dfn>automatic anchor fallbacks</dfn>
in that axis.

If the element has ''position-fallback: none'',
and is trying to use [=automatic anchor fallbacks=] in one axis,
it automatically generates a [=position fallback list=]
consisting of two entries:

* the first entry contains all the base-style properties on the element
	that are valid to use in ''@try'' rules,
	with ''anchor()/auto''/''auto-same'' keywords
	resolved to their appropriate side.
* one containing the same,
	but with the [=inset properties=] in the affected axis swapped
	(resolving the ''auto''/''auto-same'' keywords accordingly).

If the element uses [=automatic anchor positioning=] in both axises,
it instead adds four entries to the [=position fallback list=]:
one specifying the base styles, as above,
then one reversing just the block axis,
followed by one reversing just the inline axis,
followed by one reversing both axises at once.

Note: If the element has a non-none 'position-fallback',
these automatic fallbacks aren't generated.
Since the [=position fallback list=] styles
override the "base" styles immediately,
this will <em>usually</em> mean you wouldn't see a "base" ''anchor(auto)''
show up in the final styles at all,
but if that does happen
(it's specified in a property
that isn't overriden by anything in the [=position fallback list=]),
the only effect of the ''anchor()/auto''/''auto-same''
is to resolve to the appropriate side keyword.

[=Automatic anchor fallback=] can also be used as a shorthand
in ''@try'' blocks.

If applying an entry in the element's [=position fallback list=]
would cause the resulting styles
to satisfy the conditions of [=automatic anchor fallbacks=],
and the relevant ''anchor()'' function comes from a ''@try'' block
(rather than from the base styles),
then that entry of the [=position fallback list=]
must instead be treated as 2 or 4 consecutive entries,
generated as above.

(Otherwise, the ''auto'' or ''auto-same'' keywords
just resolve to the appropriate side,
with no additional effects.)

<div class=example>
	For example, the following ''@position-fallback'' rule:

	<pre class=lang-css>
	@position-fallback --compact {
		@try {
			top: anchor(auto);
			bottom: auto;
		}
	}
	</pre>

	is equivalent to the following longer, more explicit rule:

	<pre class=lang-css>
	@position-fallback --expanded {
		@try {
			top: anchor(bottom);
			bottom: auto;
		}
		@try {
			top: auto;
			bottom: anchor(top);
		}
	}
	</pre>
</div>
