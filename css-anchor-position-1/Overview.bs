Introduction {#intro}
=====================

CSS [=absolute positioning=] allows authors
to place elements anywhere on the page,
without regard to the layout of other elements
besides their containing block.
This flexibility can be very useful,
but also very limiting--
often you want to position relative to <em>some</em> other element.
<dfn export>Anchor positioning</dfn> allows authors to achieve this,
"anchoring" an [=absolutely-positioned=] element
to one or more other elements on the page,
while also allowing them to try several possible positions
to find the "best" one that avoids overlap/overflow.

For example, an author might want to position a tooltip
centered and above the targeted element,
unless that would place the tooltip offscreen,
in which case it should be below the targeted element.
This can be done with the following CSS:

<div class=example>
	<pre class=lang-css>
	.anchor {
		anchor-name: --tooltip;
	}
	.tooltip {
		/* Fixpos means we don't need to worry about
		   containing block relationships;
		   the tooltip can live anywhere in the DOM. */
		position: fixed;

		/* Align the tooltip's bottom to the top of the anchor,
		   but automatically swap if this overflows the window
		   to the tooltip's top aligns to the anchor's bottom
		   instead. */
		bottom: anchor(--tooltip auto);

		/* Set up a 300px-wide area, centered on the anchor.
		   If centering would put part of it off-screen,
		   instead clamp it to remain on-screen. */
		left: clamp(0px, anchor(--tooltip center) - 150px, 100% - 300px);
		right: clamp(0px, anchor(--tooltip center) - 150px, 100% - 300px);
		max-width: 300px;

		/* Center the tooltip in that area. */
		justify-self: center;
	}
	</pre>
</div>

Creating An Anchor: the 'anchor-name' property {#anchor-name}
----------------------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: anchor-name
Value: none | <<dashed-ident>>
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Applies to: all elements that generate a [=principal box=]
Animation Type: discrete
</pre>

The 'anchor-name' property declares
that an element is an <dfn local-lt=anchor>anchor element</dfn>,
and gives it an <dfn>anchor name</dfn> to be targeted by.
Values are defined as follows:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=anchor-name>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	:: The property has no effect.

	: <dfn><<dashed-ident>></dfn>
	:: If the element generates a [=principal box=],
		the element is an [=anchor element=],
		with an [=anchor name=] equal to the <<dashed-ident>>.
		The [=anchor name=] is a [=tree-scoped name=].

		Otherwise, the property has no effect.
</dl>

[=Anchor names=] do not need to be unique.
Not all elements are capable of being [=anchor elements=]
for a given positioned element,
so a name can be reused in multiple places
if the usages are scoped appropriately.
If there are still multiple valid [=anchor elements=]
with the given [=anchor name=],
the last one is chosen.

### Implicit Anchor Elements ### {#implicit}

Some specifications can define that,
in certain circumstances,
a particular element is an <dfn>implicit anchor element</dfn>
for a given positioned element.

<p class=example>
	For example, the Popover API allows a popover
	to declare what element is anchoring it.
	This makes the declared element the [=implicit anchor element=]
	for the popover.

[=Implicit anchor elements=] can be referenced
with the ''implicit'' keyword,
rather than referring to some 'anchor-name' value.


Finding An Anchor {#target}
-----------------

Several things in this specification
find a [=target anchor element=],
given an <dfn>anchor specifier</dfn>,
which is either a <<dashed-ident>>
(and a [=tree-scoped reference=])
that should match an 'anchor-name' value elsewhere on the page,
or the keyword ''implicit'',
or nothing (a missing specifier).

<div algorithm>
	To determine the <dfn>target [=anchor element=]</dfn>
	given a querying element |query el|
	and an optional [=anchor specifier=] |anchor spec|:

	1. If |anchor spec| was not passed,
		return the [=target anchor element=]
		for |query el|
		given the |query el|'s [=default anchor specifier=].

	2. If |anchor spec| is ''implicit'',
		and the Popover API defines an [=implicit anchor element=] for |query el|
		which is an [=acceptable anchor element=] for |query el|,
		return that element.

		Otherwise, return nothing.

		Note: Future APIs might also define implicit anchor elements.
		When they do, they'll be explicitly handled in this algorithm,
		to ensure coordination.

	3. Otherwise, |anchor spec| is a <<dashed-ident>>.
		Return the last element |el| in tree order
		that satisfies the following conditions:

		* |el| is an [=anchor element=] with an [=anchor name=] of |anchor spec|.

		* |el|'s [=anchor name=] and |anchor spec| are both associated with the same [=tree=] [=tree/root=].

			Note: The [=anchor name=] is a [=tree-scoped name=],
			while |anchor spec| is a [=tree-scoped reference=].

		* |el| is an [=acceptable anchor element=] for |query el|.

		If no element satisfies these conditions,
		return nothing.

	Note: The general rule captured by these conditions
	is that |el| must be fully laid out
	before |query el| is laid out.
	CSS's rules about the layout order of stacking contexts
	give us assurances about this,
	and the list of conditions above
	exactly rephrases the stacking context rules
	into just what's relevant for this purpose,
	ensuring there is no possibly circularity
	in anchor positioning.

	Note: An 'anchor-name' defined by styles in one [=shadow tree=]
	won't be seen by [=anchor functions=] in styles in a different [=shadow tree=],
	preserving encapsulation.
	However, <em>elements</em> in different [=shadow trees=]
	can still anchor to each other,
	so long as both the 'anchor-name' and [=anchor function=]
	come from styles in the same tree,
	such as by using ''::part()'' to style an element inside a shadow.
	([=Implicit anchor elements=] also aren't intrinsically limited to a single tree,
	but the details of that will depend on the API assigning them.)
</div>

<div algorithm="acceptable anchor element">
	An element |el| is a <dfn export>acceptable anchor element</dfn>
	for an [=absolutely positioned=] element |query el|
	if all of the following are true:

	* Either |el| is a descendant of |query el|'s [=containing block=],
		or |query el|'s [=containing block=] is the [=initial containing block=].

	* If |el| has the same [=containing block=] as |query el|,
		then either |el| is not [=absolutely positioned=],
		or |el| precedes |query el| in the tree order.

	* If |el| has a different [=containing block=] from |query el|,
		then the last [=containing block=] in |el|'s [=containing block chain=]
		before reaching |query el|'s [=containing block=]
		is either not [=absolutely positioned=]
		or precedes |query el| in the tree order.
</div>

<h3 id=anchor-default>
Default Anchors: the 'anchor-default' property</h3>

<pre class=propdef>
Name: anchor-default
Value: <<anchor-element>>
Initial: implicit
Applies to: [=absolutely positioned=] elements
Inherited: no
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

The 'anchor-default' property defines the <dfn>default anchor specifier</dfn>
for all [=anchor functions=] on the element,
allowing multiple elements to use the same set of [=anchor functions=]
(and [=position fallback lists=]!)
while changing which [=anchor element=] each is referring to.

Its values are identical to the <<anchor-element>> term
in ''anchor()'' and ''anchor-size()''.

<div class=example>
	For example, in the following code
	both ''.foo'' and ''.bar'' elements
	can use the same positioning properties and fallback,
	just changing the anchor element they're referring to:

	<pre highlight=css>
	.anchored {
		position: absolute;
		position-fallback: --under-then-over;
	}

	@position-fallback --under-then-over {
		@try {
			// No <anchor-element> specified,
			// so it takes from 'anchor-default'.
			top: calc(.5em + anchor(auto));
			bottom: auto;
		}
	}

	.foo.anchored {
		anchor-default: --foo;
	}
	.bar.anchored {
		anchor-default: --bar;
	}
	</pre>
</div>




Anchoring {#anchoring}
==================================

The <dfn export lt="anchor function">anchor functions</dfn>
''anchor()'' and ''anchor-size()'',
defined below,
give back some of the expressivity of ordinary layout
without compromising on the flexibility and power of [=absolute positioning=].
Using these functions,
one can size and position an [=absolutely positioned=] element
relative to one or more [=anchor elements=] on the page.
The ''@position-set'' rule allows even more flexibility,
allowing multiple different sizes/positions to be tried out sequentially
until one is found that fits within the [=containing block=].

Anchor-based Positioning: the ''anchor()'' function {#anchor-pos}
---------------------------------------------------

An [=absolutely-positioned=] element
can use the <dfn>anchor()</dfn> function
as a value in its [=inset properties=]
to refer to the position of one or more [=anchor elements=].
The ''anchor()'' function resolves to a <<length>>.

<pre class=prod>
	&lt;anchor()> = anchor( <<anchor-element>>? <<anchor-side>>, <<length-percentage>>? )
	<dfn><<anchor-element>></dfn> = <<dashed-ident>> | implicit
	<dfn><<anchor-side>></dfn> = auto | auto-same
	           | top | left | right | bottom
	           | start | end | self-start | self-end
	           | <<percentage>> | center
</pre>

The ''anchor()'' function has three arguments:

* the <<anchor-element>> value
	specifies how to find the [=anchor element=]
	it will be drawing positioning information from.
	If omitted, it behaves as the element's [=default anchor specifier=].

	Its possible values are:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="anchor()">
		: <dfn><<dashed-ident>></dfn>
		:: Specifies the [=anchor name=] it will look for.
			This name is a [=tree-scoped reference=].

		: <dfn>implicit</dfn>
		:: Selects the [=implicit anchor element=]
			defined for the element,
			if possible.
	</dl>

	See [=target anchor element=] for details.

* the <<anchor-side>> value
	refers to the position of the corresponding side
	of the [=target anchor element=].

	The <dfn value for=anchor()>auto</dfn>
	and <dfn value for=anchor()>auto-same</dfn> keywords
	indicate [=automatic anchor positioning=].
	See [[#anchor-auto]] for details.

	The physical <<anchor-side>> keywords
	(<dfn value for=anchor()>left</dfn>,
	<dfn value for=anchor()>right</dfn>,
	<dfn value for=anchor()>top</dfn>,
	and <dfn value for=anchor()>bottom</dfn>)
	are only useful in [=inset properties=]
	corresponding to their corresponding axis:
	for example, using ''top'' and ''bottom'' in 'left' or 'right'
	(or in 'inset-inline-start' if the inline axis is horizontal, etc)
	results in an [=invalid anchor query=].

	The logical <<anchor-side>> keywords
	(<dfn value for=anchor()>start</dfn>,
	<dfn value for=anchor()>end</dfn>,
	<dfn value for=anchor()>self-start</dfn>,
	and <dfn value for=anchor()>self-end</dfn>)
	map to one of the physical keywords
	depending on the property the function is being used in
	(''top'' or ''bottom'' in the 'top' or 'bottom' properties, etc)
	and the [=writing mode=] of either the element
	(for ''self-start'' and ''self-end'')
	or the [=writing mode=] of the element's [=containing block=]
	(for ''start'' and ''end'').

	Issue: Do we need to refer to the anchor element's [=writing mode=]?
	I think that's too unpredictable to actually do anything useful.
	If you're specifying your 'inset-inline-start' property,
	you almost certainly want to refer to an anchor edge
	relative to your own directions,
	not an unpredictable edge based on the anchor.

	A <<percentage>> value refers to a position
	a corresponding percentage between the ''start'' and ''end'' sides,
	with ''0%'' being equivalent to ''start''
	and ''100%'' being equivalent to ''end''.
	The <dfn value for=anchor()>center</dfn> keyword is equivalent to ''50%''.

* the optional <<length-percentage>> final argument is a fallback value.
	If the ''anchor()'' represents an [=invalid anchor query=],
	it resolves to this value
	rather that determining its value as detailed below.

	If omitted,
	it defaults to ''0px''.

Issue: Computed value for anchor()
probably needs to be the anchor() function,
but with the target anchor element resolved.
This allows for transitions to work properly
with tree-scoped names,
and with changing anchor elements.
See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8180">Issue 8180</a>.

An ''anchor()'' function representing a [=valid anchor query=]
resolves at [=used value=] time
to the <<length>> that would align the edge
of the positioned elements' [=inset-modified containing block=]
corresponding to the property the function appears in
with the specified border edge of the [=target anchor element=],
assuming that all [=scroll containers=]
between the [=target anchor element=]
and the positioned element's [=containing block=]
are scrolled to their initial scroll position
(but see 'anchor-scroll').

If the [=target anchor element=] is [=fragmented=],
the axis-aligned bounding rectangle
of the fragments' border boxes is used instead.

Issue: Do we need to control which box we're referring to,
so you can align to padding or content edge?

If the positioned element
has a [=snapshotted scroll offset=],
then it is additionally visually shifted
by those offsets,
as if by an additional ''translate()'' transform.

<div class=example>
	For example,
	in ''.bar { top: anchor(--foo top); }'',
	the ''anchor()'' will resolve to the length
	that'll line up the <code>.bar</code> element's top edge
	with the ''--foo'' anchor's top edge.

	On the other hand,
	in ''.bar { bottom: anchor(--foo top); }'',
	it will instead resolve to the length
	that'll line up the <code>.bar</code> element's <em>bottom</em> edge
	with the ''--foo'' anchor's top edge.

	Since 'top' and 'bottom' values specify insets from different edges
	(the top and bottom of the element's [=containing block=],
	respectively),
	the same ''anchor()'' will usually resolve to different lengths in each.
</div>

<div class=example>
	Because the ''anchor()'' function resolves to a <<length>>,
	it can be used in [=math functions=] like any other length.

	For example, the following will set up the element
	so that its [=inset-modified containing block=]
	is centered on the [=anchor element=]
	and as wide as possible without overflowing the [=containing block=]:

	<pre highlight=css>
	.centered-message {
		position: fixed;
		max-width: max-content;
		justify-content: center;

		--center: anchor(--x 50%);
		--half-distance: min(
			abs(0% - var(--center)),
			abs(100% - var(--center))
		);
		left: calc(var(--center) - var(--half-distance));
		right: calc(var(--center) - var(--half-distance));
		bottom: anchor(--x top);
	}
	</pre>

	This might be appropriate for an error message
	on an <{input}> element,
	for example,
	as the centering will make it easier to discover
	which input is being referred to.
</div>

<h4 id=anchor-auto>
Automatic Anchor Positioning</h4>

If a positioned element uses the ''anchor()'' function
with the ''anchor()/auto'' or ''auto-same'' keywords
in one of its [=inset properties=],
and the opposing [=inset property=] is ''top/auto'',
then the element is using <dfn>automatic anchor positioning</dfn>
in that property's axis.
This will resolve the ''anchor()'' function's <<anchor-side>>
to the correct side of the anchor element,
and automatically create entries in the [=position fallback list=]
to flip the positioned element to the opposite side if necessary.

[=Automatic anchor positioning=] is only active
if the opposite [=inset property=] is ''top/auto''.
(For example, if an element had ''top: anchor(auto);'',
it would have to also have ''bottom: auto;''.)
If this is not the case,
the ''anchor()'' function represents an [=invalid anchor query=],
and the element does not use [=automatic anchor positioning=] in that axis.

When using [=automatic anchor positioning=],
the ''anchor()/auto'' <<anchor-side>>
behaves as the opposite side of the property it's used in.
That is, when used in ''top: anchor(auto);'',
it's equivalent to ''top: anchor(bottom);'';
when used in ''bottom: anchor(auto);'',
it's equivalent to ''bottom: anchor(top);'';
etc.
The ''anchor()/auto-same'' <<anchor-side>>
behaves as the property it's used in:
''top: anchor(auto-same);''
is equivalent to ''top: anchor(top);'',
etc.

Additionally,
if the element has ''position-fallback: none'',
[=automatic anchor positioning=] causes the element
to gain a [=position fallback list=]
consisting of two entries:

* one containing all the base-style properties on the element
	that are valid to use in ''@try'' rules,
	with ''anchor()/auto''/''auto-same'' keywords
	resolved to their appropriate side.
* one containing the same,
	but with the [=inset properties=] in each axis swapped,
	and the ''anchor()/auto''/''auto-same'' keywords
	resolved to the opposite sides as well.

Note: If the element has a non-none 'position-fallback',
these extra entries aren't added.
Since the [=position fallback list=] styles
override the "base" styles immediately,
this will <em>usually</em> mean you wouldn't see a "base" ''anchor(auto)''
show up in the final styles at all,
but if that does happen
(it's specified in a property
that isn't overriden by anything in the [=position fallback list=]),
the only effect of the ''anchor()/auto''/''auto-same''
is to resolve to the appropriate side keyword.

<div class=example>
	For example, the following code using [=automatic anchor positioning=]:

	<pre highlight=css>
	.foo {
		position: absolute;
		top: calc(.5em + anchor(--foo auto));
	}
	</pre>

	is equivalent to the following more verbose and explicit code:

	<pre highlight=css>
	.foo {
		position: absolute;
		position-fallback: --flip;
	}
	@position-fallback --flip {
		@try {
			top: calc(.5em + anchor(--foo bottom));
			bottom: auto;
		}
		@try {
			top: auto;
			bottom: calc(.5em + anchor(--foo top));
		}
	}
	</pre>
</div>

If the element uses [=automatic anchor positioning=] in both axises,
it instead adds three entries to the [=position fallback list=]:
one reversing just the block axis,
one reversing just the inline axis,
and finally one reversing both axises at once.

''anchor()/auto'' and ''anchor()/auto-same'' used <em>in</em> a ''@try'' rule
cause the rule to insert multiple (2 or 4) sets of entries
into the [=position fallback list=],
as specified above,
if they would validly trigger [=automatic anchor positioning=].

Anchor-based Sizing: the ''anchor-size()'' function {#anchor-size}
---------------------------------------------------

An [=absolutely-positioned=] element
can use the <dfn>anchor-size()</dfn> function
in its [=sizing properties=]
to refer to the size of one or more [=anchor elements=].
The ''anchor-size()'' function resolves to a <<length>>.

<pre class=prod>
anchor-size() = anchor( <<anchor-element>>? <<anchor-size>>, <<length-percentage>>? )
<dfn><<anchor-size>></dfn> = width | height | block | inline | self-block | self-inline
</pre>

The ''anchor-size()'' function is similar to ''anchor()'',
and takes the same arguments,
save that the <<anchor-side>> keywords are replaced with <<anchor-size>>,
referring to the distance between two opposing sides.

The physical <<anchor-size>> keywords
(<dfn value for=anchor-size()>width</dfn>
and <dfn value for=anchor-size()>height</dfn>)
refer to the width and height,
respectively,
of the [=target anchor element=].
Unlike ''anchor()'', there is no restriction on having to match axises;
for example, ''width: anchor-size(--foo height);'' is valid.

The logical <<anchor-size>> keywords
(<dfn value for=anchor-size()>block</dfn>,
<dfn value for=anchor-size()>inline</dfn>,
<dfn value for=anchor-size()>self-block</dfn>,
and <dfn value for=anchor-size()>self-inline</dfn>)
map to one of the physical keywords
according to either the [=writing mode=] of the element
(for ''self-block'' and ''self-inline'')
or the [=writing mode=] of the element's [=containing block=]
(for ''anchor-size()/block'' and ''anchor-size()/inline'').

An ''anchor-size()'' function representing a [=valid anchor query=]
resolves to the <<length>> separating the relevant border edges
(either left and right, or top and bottom,
whichever is in the specified axis)
of the [=target anchor element=].

Taking Scroll Into Account: the 'anchor-scroll' property {#scroll}
------------------------------------------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: anchor-scroll
Value: none | default | <<anchor-element>>
Initial: default
Inherited: no
Applies to: [=absolutely-positioned=] elements
Animation Type: discrete
</pre>

Because scrolling is often done in a separate thread from layout in implementations for performance reasons,
but ''anchor()'' can result in both positioning changes
(which can be handled in the scrolling thread)
and layout changes
(which cannot),
''anchor()'' is defined to assume
all the [=scroll containers=] between the anchor element
and the positioned element's containing block
are at their initial scroll position.
This means a positioned element
will <em>not</em> be aligned with its anchor
if any of the scrollers are <em>not</em> at their initial positions.

The 'anchor-scroll' property allows an author to compensate for this,
without losing the performance benefits of the separate scrolling thread,
so long as the positioned element
is only anchoring to a single anchor element.
Its values are:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=anchor-scroll>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	:: No effect.

	: <dfn>default</dfn>
	:: Behaves identically to <<anchor-element>>,
		but draws its value from 'anchor-default' on the element.

	: <dfn><<anchor-element>></dfn>
	::
		Selects a [=target anchor element=]
		the same as ''anchor()'',
		which will be compensated for in positioning and fallback.
</dl>

Note: When the element uses 'anchor-default'
or has an [=implicit anchor element=],
authors can often avoid explicitly setting an 'anchor-scroll' value
because the initial value is ''anchor-scroll/default''.

<div algorithm="compensate for scroll">
	If 'anchor-scroll' is not ''anchor-scroll/none''
	on an [=absolutely-positioned=] element |query el|,
	and there is a [=target anchor element=] for |query el|
	given the 'anchor-scroll' value,
	and at least one ''anchor()'' function on |query el|
	refers to the same [=target anchor element=],
	then |query el| has a <dfn>snapshotted scroll offset</dfn>,
	which is a pair of lengths
	representing a vertical and horizontal offset.

	The [=snapshotted scroll offset=]
	is the sum of the offsets from the [=initial scroll position=]
	of all [=scroll container=] ancestors of the [=target anchor element=],
	up to but not including |query el|'s [=containing block=].

	Issue: Define the precise timing of the snapshot:
	updated each frame,
	before style recalc.
</div>

Anchor Queries {#queries}
--------------

The ''anchor()'' and ''anchor-size()'' functions
represent an <dfn>anchor query</dfn>:
a request for the position of one or more sides
of one or more [=anchor elements=].

[=Anchor queries=] are <dfn lt="valid anchor query|invalid anchor query" local-lt="invalid|valid">valid</dfn>
only if all of the following conditions are true:

* Their function is used on an element that is [=absolutely-positioned=].
* If representing an ''anchor()'' function,
	the function is being used in an [=inset property=].
* If representing an ''anchor()'' function
	and the <<anchor-side>> keyword is a physical keyword,
	it's used in an [=inset property=] in the corresponding axis.
* If representing an ''anchor-size()'' function,
	the function is being used in a [=sizing property=].
* There is a [=target anchor element=]
	for the element
	and the [=anchor name=] specified in the function.

Note: As specified in the definition of ''anchor()'',
an [=invalid anchor query=]
causes the function to resolve to its fallback value instead.

Fallback Sizing/Positioning {#fallback}
===========================

Anchor positioning,
while powerful,
can also be unpredictable.
The [=anchor element=] might be anywhere on the page,
so positioning an element in any particular fashion
(such as above the anchor, or the right of the anchor)
might result in the positioned element overflowing its [=containing block=]
or being positioned partially off screen.

To ameliorate this, an [=absolutely positioned=] element
can use the 'position-fallback' property
to refer to a ''@position-fallback'' block,
giving a list of possible style rules to try out.
Each is applied to the element, one by one,
and the first that doesn't cause the element
to overflow its [=containing block=]
is taken as the winner.

The 'position-fallback' Property {#fallback-property}
--------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: position-fallback
Value: none | <<dashed-ident>>
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Applies to: [=absolutely-positioned=] elements
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

Values have the following meanings:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=position-fallback>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	:: The property has no effect;
		the element does not use a [=position fallback list=].

	: <dfn><<dashed-ident>></dfn>
	:: If there is a ''@position-fallback'' rule
		with a name matching the specified ident,
		then the element uses that [=position fallback list=].

		Otherwise,
		this value has no effect.
</dl>

The ''@position-fallback'' Rule {#fallback-rule}
-------------------------------

The <dfn>@position-fallback</dfn> rule
defines a [=position fallback list=]
with a given name,
specifying one or more sets of positioning properties
inside of <dfn>@try</dfn> blocks
that will be applied to an element,
with each successive one serving as fallback
if the previous would cause the element
to partially or fully overflow its [=containing block=].

The grammar of the ''@position-fallback'' rule is:

<pre class=prod>
@position-fallback <<dashed-ident>> {
	<<rule-list>>
}

@try { <<declaration-list>> }
</pre>

The ''@position-fallback'' rule only accepts ''@try'' rules.
The <<dashed-ident>> specified in the prelude
is the rule's name.
If multiple ''@position-fallback'' rules are declared with the same name,
the last one in document order "wins".

The ''@try'' rule only accepts the following [=properties=]:

* [=inset properties=]
* [=sizing properties=]
* [=box alignment properties=]

Issue: What exactly are the constraints that determine what's allowed here?
Current list is based off of what's reasonable
from Chrome's experimental impl.
We can make a CQ that keys off of which fallback was used
to allow more general styling,
at least for descendants.

The ''@try'' rules inside a ''@position-fallback''
specify a <dfn>position fallback list</dfn>,
where each entry consists of the properties specified by each ''@try'',
in order.

Issue: Would be useful to be able to detect
when your anchor(s) are fully off-screen
and suppress your display entirely.
For example, tooltips living outside the scroller
holding the text they're anchored to
don't want to just hover over arbitrary parts of the page
because their anchor happens to have that position
relative to the scrollport.

Note: If multiple elements using different anchors
want to use the same fallback positioning,
just relative to their own anchor elements,
omit the <<anchor-element>> in ''anchor()''
and specify each element's anchor in 'anchor-default' instead.

Note: The most common types of fallback positioning
(putting the positioned element on one side of the anchor normally,
but flipping to the opposite side if needed)
can be done automatically,
without using ''@position-fallback'' at all,
by using ''anchor()/auto'' or ''anchor()/auto-side''
side values in the ''anchor()'' function.


Applying Position Fallback {#fallback-apply}
--------------------------

When an element uses a [=position fallback list=],
it selects one entry from the list
as defined below,
and applies those properties to itself as [=used values=].

Note: These have to be applied as used values
because we're in the middle of layout right now;
defining how they'd interact with the cascade
would be extremely confusing *at a minimum*,
and perhaps actually circular.
In any case, not worth the cost in spec or impl.

Issue: This implies that the values can't be transitioned in the usual fashion,
since transitions key off of computed values
and we're past that point.
However, popovers sliding between positions is a common effect in UI libs.
Probably should introduce a <css>smooth</css> keyword
to 'position-fallback'
to trigger automatic "animation" of the fallback'd properties.

<div algorithm>
	To <dfn>determine the position fallback styles</dfn> of an element |el|:

	1. Let |base styles| be the current used styles of |el|.

	2. [=list/For each=] |fallback styles| in the [=position fallback list=]:

		1. Apply the styles in |fallback styles| to |el|,
			overriding the corresponding properties in |base styles|.

			Perform any specified/computed/used-value time normalizations
			that are required to make the overridden styles into [=used values=]
			(such as resolving [=math functions=], etc).

			Let |adjusted styles|
			be |el|'s styles after these adjustments.

		2. If |el| has a [=snapshotted scroll offset=],
			then subtract the offsets
			from |el|'s margin box's position.

			Also, if any of |el|'s [=inset properties=] are non-auto,
			subtract the [=snapshotted scroll offset=] for the appropriate axis
			from their values.
			Recalculate |el|'s [=inset-modified containing block=]
			using these shifted values
			to obtain the |scroll-adjusted IMCB|.

		3. If |el|'s margin box is fully contained within the |scroll-adjusted IMCB|,
			or |fallback styles| is the final entry in the [=position fallback list=],
			then use |adjusted styles| for |el|
			and exit this algorithm.

	Note: Descendants overflowing |el|
	don't affect this calculation,
	only |el|'s own [=margin box=].
</div>

The styles returned by [=determining the position fallback styles=]
are taken as the final values for the specified properties.

Implementations may choose to impose an implementation-defined limit
on the length of [=position fallback lists=],
to limit the amount of excess layout work that may be required.
This limit must be <em>at least</em> five.

<div class=issue>
	Nested anchors
	(an anchored element inside of another anchored element)
	present the potential for exponential blow-up of layouts
	when doing fallback,
	since the grandchild anchored element can cause scrollbars on an ancestor,
	changing the IMCB for the child anchored element,
	thus possibly causing the fallback choice to change for it.

	There are strategies to avoid this,
	but they're not without costs of their own.
	We should <em>probably</em> impose a <strong>maximum</strong> limit as well,
	to avoid this.

	However, since *most* usages won't be problematic in the first place,
	we don't want to restrict them unduly
	just to prevent weird situations from exploding.
	Perhaps a complexity budget based on the branching factor at each level?
	Like, accumulate the product of the fallback list lengths from ancestors,
	and your fallback list gets limited to not exceed a total product
	of, say, 1k.
	Get too deep and you're stuck with your first choice only!
	But this would allow large, complex fallback lists for top-level stuff,
	and even some reasonable nesting.
	(Length-five lists could be nested to depth of 4, for example,
	if we did go with 1k.)

	More thought is needed.
</div>

<div class=example>
	For example,
	the following CSS will first attempt to position a "popover"
	below the [=element=],
	but if it doesn't fit on-screen will switch to being above;
	it defaults to left-aligning,
	but will switch to right-aligning if that doesn't fit.

	<pre highlight=css>
	#myPopover {
		position: fixed;
		position-fallback: --button-popover;
		overflow: auto;

		/* The popover is at least as wide as the button */
		min-width: anchor-size(--button width);

		/* The popover is at least as tall as 2 menu items */
		min-height: 6em;
	}

	@position-fallback --button-popover {
		/* First try to align the top, left edge of the popover
		with the bottom, left edge of the button. */
		@try {
			top: anchor(--button bottom);
			left: anchor(--button left);
		}

		/* Next try to align the bottom, left edge of the popover
		with the top, left edge of the button. */
		@try {
			bottom: anchor(--button top);
			left: anchor(--button left);
		}

		/* Next try to align the top, right edge of the popover
		with the bottom, right edge of the button. */
		@try {
			top: anchor(--button bottom);
			right: anchor(--button right);
		}

		/* Finally, try to align the bottom, right edge of the popover
		with the top, right edge of the button. Other positions are possible,
		but this is the final option the author would like the rendering
		engine to try. */
		@try {
			bottom: anchor(--button top);
			right: anchor(--button right);
		}
	}
	</pre>
