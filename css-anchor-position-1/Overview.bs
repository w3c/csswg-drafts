Introduction {#intro}
=====================

CSS [=absolute positioning=] allows authors
to place elements anywhere on the page,
without regard to the layout of other elements
besides their containing block.
This flexibility can be very useful,
but also very limiting--
often you want to position relative to <em>some</em> other element.
<dfn export>Anchor positioning</dfn>
(via the <dfn export>anchor functions</dfn> ''anchor()'' and ''anchor-size()'')
allows authors to achieve this,
"anchoring" an [=absolutely-positioned=] element
to one or more other elements on the page,
while also allowing them to try several possible positions
to find the "best" one that avoids overlap/overflow.

For example, an author might want to position a tooltip
centered and above the targeted element,
unless that would place the tooltip offscreen,
in which case it should be below the targeted element.
This can be done with the following CSS:

<div class=example>
	<pre class=lang-css>
	.anchor {
		anchor-name: --tooltip;
	}
	.tooltip {
		/* Fixpos means we don't need to worry about
		   containing block relationships;
		   the tooltip can live anywhere in the DOM. */
		position: fixed;

		/* All the anchoring behavior will default to
		   referring to the --tooltip anchor. */
		anchor-default: --tooltip;

		/* Align the tooltip's bottom to the top of the anchor,
		   but automatically swap if this overflows the window
		   to the tooltip's top aligns to the anchor's bottom
		   instead. */
		bottom: anchor(outside);

		/* Set up a 300px-wide area, centered on the anchor.
		   If centering would put part of it off-screen,
		   instead clamp it to remain on-screen. */
		left: clamp(0px, anchor(center) - 150px, 100% - 300px);
		right: clamp(0px, anchor(center) - 150px, 100% - 300px);
		max-width: 300px;

		/* Center the tooltip in that area. */
		justify-self: center;
	}
	</pre>
</div>

Creating An Anchor: the 'anchor-name' property {#name}
----------------------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: anchor-name
Value: none | <<dashed-ident>>#
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Applies to: all elements that generate a [=principal box=]
Animation Type: discrete
</pre>

The 'anchor-name' property declares
that an element is an <dfn local-lt=anchor>anchor element</dfn>,
and gives it a list of <dfn lt="anchor name">anchor names</dfn> to be targeted by.
Values are defined as follows:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=anchor-name>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	:: The property has no effect.

	: <dfn><<dashed-ident>>#</dfn>
	:: If the element generates a [=principal box=],
		the element is an [=anchor element=],
		with a list of [=anchor names=] as specified.
		Each [=anchor name=] is a [=tree-scoped name=].

		Otherwise, the property has no effect.
</dl>

[=Anchor names=] do not need to be unique.
Not all elements are capable of being [=anchor elements=]
for a given positioned element,
so a name can be reused in multiple places
if the usages are scoped appropriately.
[=Anchor names=] are style-contained, [=scoped to a sub-tree=].
If there are still multiple valid [=anchor elements=]
with the given [=anchor name=],
the last one is chosen.

### Implicit Anchor Elements ### {#implicit}

Some specifications can define that,
in certain circumstances,
a particular element is an <dfn>implicit anchor element</dfn>
for a given positioned element.

<p class=example>
	TODO fill in new popover-related details.
	This makes the declared element the [=implicit anchor element=]
	for the element with the attribute.

[=Implicit anchor elements=] can be referenced
with the ''implicit'' keyword,
rather than referring to some 'anchor-name' value.

A ''::before'', ''::after'' or ''::backdrop'' [=pseudo-element=]
has the same [=implicit anchor element=]
as its [=originating element=].

Note: Without this, these [=pseudo-elements=], which are often inaccessible
by other specifications, cannot be positioned with [=implicit anchor elements=].

Finding An Anchor {#target}
-----------------

Several things in this specification
find a [=target anchor element=],
given an <dfn>anchor specifier</dfn>,
which is either a <<dashed-ident>>
(and a [=tree-scoped reference=])
that should match an 'anchor-name' value elsewhere on the page,
or the keyword ''implicit'',
or nothing (a missing specifier).

<div algorithm>
	To determine the <dfn>target [=anchor element=]</dfn>
	given a querying element |query el|
	and an optional [=anchor specifier=] |anchor spec|:

	1. If |anchor spec| was not passed,
		return the [=target anchor element=]
		for |query el|
		given the |query el|'s [=default anchor specifier=].

	2. If |anchor spec| is ''implicit'':
		1. If the Popover API defines an [=implicit anchor element=] for |query el|
			which is an [=acceptable anchor element=] for |query el|,
			return that element.

		2. Otherwise, return nothing.

		Note: Future APIs might also define implicit anchor elements.
		When they do, they'll be explicitly handled in this algorithm,
		to ensure coordination.

	3. Otherwise, |anchor spec| is a <<dashed-ident>>.
		Return the last element |el| in tree order
		that satisfies the following conditions:

		* |el| is an [=anchor element=] with an [=anchor name=] of |anchor spec|.

		* |el|'s [=anchor name=] and |anchor spec| are both associated with the same [=tree=] [=tree/root=].

			Note: The [=anchor name=] is a [=tree-scoped name=],
			while |anchor spec| is a [=tree-scoped reference=].

		* |el| is an [=acceptable anchor element=] for |query el|.

		If no element satisfies these conditions,
		return nothing.

	Note: The general rule captured by these conditions
	is that |el| must be fully laid out
	before |query el| is laid out.
	CSS's rules about the layout order of stacking contexts
	give us assurances about this,
	and the list of conditions above
	exactly rephrases the stacking context rules
	into just what's relevant for this purpose,
	ensuring there is no possibly circularity
	in anchor positioning.

	Note: An 'anchor-name' defined by styles in one [=shadow tree=]
	won't be seen by [=anchor functions=] in styles in a different [=shadow tree=],
	preserving encapsulation.
	However, <em>elements</em> in different [=shadow trees=]
	can still anchor to each other,
	so long as both the 'anchor-name' and [=anchor function=]
	come from styles in the same tree,
	such as by using ''::part()'' to style an element inside a shadow.
	([=Implicit anchor elements=] also aren't intrinsically limited to a single tree,
	but the details of that will depend on the API assigning them.)
</div>

<div algorithm="acceptable anchor element">
	An element |el| is a <dfn export>acceptable anchor element</dfn>
	for an [=absolutely positioned=] element |query el|
	if all of the following are true:

	* Either |el| is a descendant of |query el|'s [=containing block=],
		or |query el|'s [=containing block=] is the [=initial containing block=].

	* If |el| has the same [=containing block=] as |query el|,
		then either |el| is not [=absolutely positioned=],
		or |el| precedes |query el| in the tree order.

	* If |el| has a different [=containing block=] from |query el|,
		then the last [=containing block=] in |el|'s [=containing block chain=]
		before reaching |query el|'s [=containing block=]
		is either not [=absolutely positioned=]
		or precedes |query el| in the tree order.
</div>

<h3 id=anchor-default>
Default Anchors: the 'anchor-default' property</h3>

<pre class=propdef>
Name: anchor-default
Value: <<anchor-element>>
Initial: implicit
Applies to: [=absolutely positioned=] elements
Inherited: no
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

The 'anchor-default' property defines the <dfn>default anchor specifier</dfn>
for all [=anchor functions=] on the element,
allowing multiple elements to use the same set of [=anchor functions=]
(and [=position options lists=]!)
while changing which [=anchor element=] each is referring to.

The [=target anchor element=] selected by the [=default anchor specifier=]
(if one exists)
is the element's <dfn>default anchor element</dfn>.

Its values are identical to the <<anchor-element>> term
in ''anchor()'' and ''anchor-size()''.

<div class=example>
	For example, in the following code
	both ''.foo'' and ''.bar'' elements
	can use the same positioning properties and fallback,
	just changing the anchor element they're referring to:

	<pre highlight=css>
	.anchored {
		position: absolute;
		position-fallback: --under-then-over;
	}

	@position-fallback --under-then-over {
		@try {
			// No <<anchor-element>> specified,
			// so it takes from 'anchor-default'.
			top: calc(.5em + anchor(outside));
			bottom: auto;
		}
	}

	.foo.anchored {
		anchor-default: --foo;
	}
	.bar.anchored {
		anchor-default: --bar;
	}
	</pre>
</div>


Anchor-Based Positioning {#positioning}
========================

An [=absolutely-positioned=] element
can position itself relative to one or more [=anchor elements=] on the page.

The 'inset-area' function offers a convenient grid-based concept
for positioning relative to the [=default anchor element=];
for more complex positioning or positioning relative to multiple elements,
the ''anchor()'' function can be used in the [=inset properties=]
to explicitly refer to edges of an [=anchor element=].

The 'inset-area' Property {#inset-area}
---------------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: inset-area
Value: none | <<inset-area>>
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Applies to: positioned elements with a [=default anchor element=]
Animation type: TBD
</pre>

Most common use-cases of anchor positioning
only need to worry about
the edges of the positioned element's [=containing block=],
and the edges of the [=default anchor element=].
These lines can be thought of as defining a 3x3 grid;
'inset-area' lets you easily set up the positioned element's [=inset properties=]
by specifying what area of this [=inset-area grid=] you want the positioned element to be in.
Its syntax is:

<pre class=prod>
<dfn>&lt;inset-area></dfn> = [
	[ left | center | right | center-left | center-right
	| x-start | x-end | center-x-start | center-x-end
	| x-self-start | x-self-end | center-x-self-start | center-x-self-end
	| all ]
	||
	[ top | center | bottom | center-top | center-bottom
	| y-start | y-end | center-y-start | center-y-end
	| y-self-start | y-self-end | center-y-self-start | center-y-self-end
	| all ]
|
	[ block-start | center | block-end | center-block-start | center-block-end
	| self-block-start | self-block-end | center-self-block-start | center-self-block-end
	| all ]
	||
	[ inline-start | center | inline-end | center-inline-start | center-inline-end
	| self-inline-start | self-inline-end | center-self-inline-start | center-self-inline-end
	| all ]
|
	[ start | center | end | center-start | center-end | all ]{1, 2}
|
	[ self-start | center | self-end | center-self-start | center-self-end | all ]{1, 2}
]
</pre>

<dl dfn-for=inset-area dfn-type=value>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	:: The property has no effect.

	: <dfn><<inset-area>></dfn>
	::
		If the element does not have a [=default anchor element=],
		or is not an [=absolutely-positioned=] element,
		this value has no effect.

		Otherwise, the property selects a region of the [=inset-area grid=],
		and makes that the element's [=containing block=].

		Note: This means that the [=inset properties=] specify offsets from the inset-area,
		and some property values,
		like ''max-height: 100%'',
		will be relative to the inset-area as well.

		Additionally, the ''align-self/normal'' value for the [=self-alignment properties=]
		behaves as either ''align-self/start'', ''align-self/end'',
		or ''align-self/anchor-center'',
		depending on the positioning of the region,
		to give a good default alignment for the positioned element.

		See [[#resolving-spans]] for details on both of these effects.
		If the two <<inset-area-span>>s do not define a valid region,
		this property is invalid.

		Also, any ''top/auto'' [=inset properties=] resolve to ''0''.
</dl>


<h4 id=resolving-spans>
Resolving <<inset-area-span>>s</h4>

The <dfn export>inset-area grid</dfn> is a 3x3 grid,
composed of four grid lines in each axis.
In order:

* the start edge of the element's pre-modification [=containing block=],
	or the ''anchor-start()'' edge of the [=default anchor element=]
	if that is more [=start=]-ward
* the ''anchor(start)'' edge of the [=default anchor element=]
* the ''anchor(end)'' edge of the [=default anchor element=]
* the end edge of the element's pre-modification [=containing block=],
	or the ''anchor-start()'' edge fo the [=default anchor element=]
	if that is more [=end=]-ward.

An <<inset-area>> selects a region of this grid
by specifying the rows and columns the region occupies,
with each of the two keywords specifying one of them:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="inset-area, <inset-area>">
	: <dfn>start</dfn>, <dfn>end</dfn>, <dfn>self-start</dfn>, <dfn>self-end</dfn>
	: <dfn>top</dfn>, <dfn>bottom</dfn>, <dfn>left</dfn>, <dfn>right</dfn>
	: <dfn>y-start</dfn>, <dfn>y-end</dfn>, <dfn>y-self-start</dfn>, <dfn>y-self-end</dfn>
	: <dfn>x-start</dfn>, <dfn>x-end</dfn>, <dfn>x-self-start</dfn>, <dfn>x-self-end</dfn>
	: <dfn>block-start</dfn>, <dfn>block-end</dfn>, <dfn>block-self-start</dfn>, <dfn>block-self-end</dfn>
	: <dfn>inline-start</dfn>, <dfn>inline-end</dfn>, <dfn>inline-self-start</dfn>, <dfn>inline-self-end</dfn>
	: <dfn>center</dfn>
	:: The single corresponding row or column,
		depending on which axis this keyword is specifying.

		Like in ''anchor()'',
		the plain logical keywords
		(''inset-area/start'', ''inset-area/end'', etc)
		refer to the writing mode of the element's [=containing block=].
		The ''inset-area/x-start''/etc determine their direction in the same way,
		but in the specified physical axis.

		The "self" logical keywords
		(''inset-area/self-start'', ''inset-area/x-self-end'', etc)
		are identical,
		but refer to the element's own writing mode.

	: <dfn>center-start</dfn>, <dfn>center-end</dfn>
	: <dfn>center-top</dfn>, <dfn>center-bottom</dfn>
	: <dfn>center-y-start</dfn>, <dfn>center-y-end</dfn>
	: <dfn>center-x-start</dfn>, <dfn>center-x-end</dfn>
	: <dfn>center-block-start</dfn>, <dfn>center-block-end</dfn>
	: <dfn>center-inline-start</dfn>, <dfn>center-inline-end</dfn>
	:: Two rows or columns,
		depending on which axis this keyword is specifying:
		the center row/column,
		and the row/column corresponding to the other half of the keyword
		as per the single-track keywords.

		(For example, ''center-top'' spans the first two rows--
		the center row and the top row.)

	: <dfn>all</dfn>
	:: All three rows or columns,
		depending on which axis this keyword is specifying.
</dl>

Some keywords are ambiguous about what axis they refer to:
''inset-area/center'', ''inset-area/all'',
and the ''inset-area/start''/etc keywords that don't specify the block or inline axis explicitly.
If the other keyword is unambiguous about its axis,
then the ambiguous keyword is referring to the opposite axis.
(For example, in ''block-start center'',
the ''inset-area/center'' keyword is referring to the inline axis.)
If both keywords are ambiguous, however,
then the first refers to the block axis of the element's [=containing block=],
and the second to the inline axis.
(For example, ''all start'' is equivalent to ''all inline-start''.)

If only a single keyword is given,
it behaves as if the second keyword is ''inset-area/all''
if the given keyword is unambigous about its axis;
otherwise, it behaves as if the given keyword was repeated.
(For example, ''inset-area/top'' is equivalent to ''top all'',
but ''inset-area/center'' is equivalent to ''center center''.)

<hr>

The <<inset-area>> also implies a default [=self-alignment=],
which will be used if the [=self-alignment property=] on the element
is ''align-self/normal'':

* If the inset area includes the center region in an axis
	the default alignment in that axis is ''align-self/anchor-center''.
* Otherwise, it's the opposite of the region it specifies:
	if it's specifying the "start" region of its axis,
	the default alignment in that axis is ''align-self/end''; etc.

<div class=example>
	For example, assuming an English-equivalent writing mode (horizontal-tb, ltr),
	then the value ''center-x-start top'' resolves to
	the "start" region of the vertical axis,
	and the "start" and "center" regions of the horizontal axis,
	so the default alignments will be ''align-self: end;'' and ''justify-self: anchor-center;''

		<img src="images/inset-area-example.png" width=400>
		<figcaption>
			An example of ''inset-area: center-x-start top'' positioning.
		</figcaption>
</div>

Note: When the [=default anchor element=]
is partially or completely outside of the pre-modified [=containing block=],
some of the [=inset-area grid's=] rows or columns can be zero-sized.

The ''anchor()'' Function {#anchor-pos}
---------------------------------------------------

An [=absolutely-positioned=] element
can use the <dfn>anchor()</dfn> function
as a value in its [=inset properties=]
to refer to the position of one or more [=anchor elements=].
The ''anchor()'' function resolves to a <<length>>.

<pre class=prod>
	&lt;anchor()> = anchor( <<anchor-element>>? <<anchor-side>>, <<length-percentage>>? )
	<dfn><<anchor-element>></dfn> = <<dashed-ident>> | implicit
	<dfn><<anchor-side>></dfn> = inside | outside
	           | top | left | right | bottom
	           | start | end | self-start | self-end
	           | <<percentage>> | center
</pre>

The ''anchor()'' function has three arguments:

* the <<anchor-element>> value
	specifies how to find the [=anchor element=]
	it will be drawing positioning information from.
	If omitted, it behaves as the element's [=default anchor specifier=].
	Its possible values are:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="anchor()">
		: <dfn><<dashed-ident>></dfn>
		:: Specifies the [=anchor name=] it will look for.
			This name is a [=tree-scoped reference=].

		: <dfn>implicit</dfn>
		:: Selects the [=implicit anchor element=]
			defined for the element,
			if possible.
	</dl>

	See [=target anchor element=] for details.

* the <<anchor-side>> value
	refers to the position of the corresponding side
	of the [=target anchor element=].
	Its possible values are:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="anchor()">
		: <dfn>inside</dfn>
		: <dfn>outside</dfn>
		:: Resolves to one of the [=anchor element's=] sides,
			depending on which [=inset property=] it's used in.
			''anchor()/inside'' refers to the same side as the [=inset property=]
			(attaching the element to the "inside" of the anchor),
			while ''anchor()/outside'' refers to the opposite.

		: <dfn>top</dfn>
		: <dfn>right</dfn>
		: <dfn>bottom</dfn>
		: <dfn>left</dfn>
		:: Refers to the specified side of the [=anchor element=].

			Note: These are only usable in the [=inset properties=]
			in the matching axis.
			For example, ''anchor()/left'' is usable in 'left', 'right',
			or the logical [=inset properties=] that refer to the horizontal axis.

		: <dfn>start</dfn>
		: <dfn>end</dfn>
		: <dfn>self-start</dfn>
		: <dfn>self-end</dfn>
		:: Refers to one of the sides of the [=anchor element=]
			in the same axis as the [=inset property=] it's used in,
			by resolving the keyword against the [=writing mode=]
			of either the positioned element
			(for ''anchor()/self-start'' and ''anchor()/self-end'')
			or the positioned element's containing block
			(for ''anchor()/start'' and ''anchor()/end'').

		: <dfn><<percentage>></dfn>
		: <dfn>center</dfn>
		:: Refers to a position
			a corresponding percentage between the ''anchor()/start'' and ''anchor()/end'' sides,
			with ''0%'' being equivalent to ''anchor()/start''
			and ''100%'' being equivalent to ''anchor()/end''.

			''anchor()/center'' is equivalent to ''50%''.

* the optional <<length-percentage>> final argument is a fallback value,
	specifying what the function should resolve to
	if it's an [=invalid anchor function=].

Issue: Computed value for anchor()
probably needs to be the anchor() function,
but with the target anchor element resolved.
This allows for transitions to work properly
with tree-scoped names,
and with changing anchor elements.
See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8180">Issue 8180</a>.

An ''anchor()'' function representing a [=valid anchor function=]
resolves at [=used value=] time
to the <<length>> that would align the edge
of the positioned elements' [=inset-modified containing block=]
corresponding to the property the function appears in
with the specified border edge of the [=target anchor element=],
assuming that all [=scroll containers=]
between the [=target anchor element=]
and the positioned element's [=containing block=]
are scrolled to their initial scroll position
(but see [[#scroll]]).

If the [=target anchor element=] is [=fragmented=],
the axis-aligned bounding rectangle
of the fragments' border boxes is used instead.

Issue: Do we need to control which box we're referring to,
so you can align to padding or content edge?

The positioned element
is additionally visually shifted
by its [=snapshotted scroll offset=],
as if by an additional ''translate()'' transform.

<div class=example>
	For example,
	in ''.bar { top: anchor(--foo top); }'',
	the ''anchor()'' will resolve to the length
	that'll line up the <code>.bar</code> element's top edge
	with the ''--foo'' anchor's top edge.

	On the other hand,
	in ''.bar { bottom: anchor(--foo top); }'',
	it will instead resolve to the length
	that'll line up the <code>.bar</code> element's <em>bottom</em> edge
	with the ''--foo'' anchor's top edge.

	Since 'top' and 'bottom' values specify insets from different edges
	(the top and bottom of the element's [=containing block=],
	respectively),
	the same ''anchor()'' will usually resolve to different lengths in each.
</div>

<div class=example>
	Because the ''anchor()'' function resolves to a <<length>>,
	it can be used in [=math functions=] like any other length.

	For example, the following will set up the element
	so that its [=inset-modified containing block=]
	is centered on the [=anchor element=]
	and as wide as possible without overflowing the [=containing block=]:

	<pre highlight=css>
	.centered-message {
		position: fixed;
		max-width: max-content;
		justify-self: center;

		--center: anchor(--x 50%);
		--half-distance: min(
			abs(0% - var(--center)),
			abs(100% - var(--center))
		);
		left: calc(var(--center) - var(--half-distance));
		right: calc(var(--center) - var(--half-distance));
		bottom: anchor(--x top);
	}
	</pre>

	This might be appropriate for an error message
	on an <{input}> element,
	for example,
	as the centering will make it easier to discover
	which input is being referred to.
</div>

Centering on the Anchor: the ''anchor-center'' value {#anchor-center}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: justify-self, align-self, justify-items, align-items
New Values: anchor-center
</pre>

The [=self-alignment properties=] allow an [=absolutely-positioned=] element
to align itself within the [=inset-modified containing block=].
The existing values,
plus carefully chosen [=inset properties=],
are usually enough for useful alignment,
but a common case for anchored positioning--
centering over the anchor element--
requires careful and somewhat complex set-up to achieve.

The new <dfn value for="justify-self, align-self, justify-items, align-items">anchor-center</dfn> value
makes this case extremely simple:
if the positioned element has a [=default anchor element=],
then it is aligned so as to center itself
over the [=default anchor element=]
in the relevant axis.

Additionally,
any ''top/auto'' [=inset properties=] resolve to ''0''.
However, the [=available space=] for the positioned element in the relevant axis
is reduced to the size of the largest rectangle
that is centered on the [=default anchor element=]
and doesn't overflow the [=inset-modified containing block=].
(Possibly being zero-sized,
if the anchor's center is not within the [=inset-modified containing block=].)

If the element is not [=absolutely positioned=],
or does not have a [=default anchor element=],
this value behaves as ''<self-position>/center''
and has no additional effect on how [=inset properties=] resolve.

Taking Scroll Into Account {#scroll}
------------------------------------------------------------------

Because scrolling is often done in a separate thread from layout in implementations for performance reasons,
but ''anchor()'' can result in both positioning changes
(which can be handled in the scrolling thread)
and layout changes
(which cannot),
''anchor()'' is defined to assume
all the [=scroll containers=] between the anchor element
and the positioned element's containing block
are at their initial scroll position.
This means a positioned element
will <em>not</em> be aligned with its anchor
if any of the scrollers are <em>not</em> at their initial positions.

To compensate for this without losing
the performance benefits of the separate scrolling thread,
we define:

<div algorithm="compensate for scroll">
	An [=absolutely-positioned=] element |query el|
	<dfn>needs scroll adjustment</dfn>
	in the horizontal or vertical axis
	if both of the following conditions are true:

	* |query el| has a [=default anchor element=].

	* At least one ''anchor()'' function on |query el|'s
		used [=inset properties=] in the axis
		refers to a [=target anchor element=]
		with the same nearest [=scroll container=] ancestor
		as |query el|'s [=default anchor element=],
		or |query el|'s used [=self-alignment property=] value
		in the axis is ''anchor-center''.

	Note: If |query el| has a [=position options list=],
	then whether it [=needs scroll adjustment=] in an axis
	is also affected by the applied fallback style.

	|query el|'s <dfn>snapshotted scroll offset</dfn> is a pair of lengths
	for the horizontal and vertical axises, respectively.
	Each length is calculated as:

	* If |query el| [=needs scroll adjustment=] in the axis,
		then the length is the sum of the [=scroll offsets=]
		of all [=scroll container=] ancestors
		of the [=default anchor element=]
		in the same axis,
		up to but not including |query el|'s [=containing block=];

	* Otherwise, the length is 0.

	Issue: Define the precise timing of the snapshot:
	updated each frame,
	before style recalc.

	If |query el| has an [=additional fallback-bounds rect=],
	similarly calculate the sum of [=scroll offsets=]
	of all [=scroll container=] ancestors
	of the element generating the [=additional fallback-bounds rect=],
	up to but not including |query el|'s [=containing block=],
	and subtract that summed offset
	from the [=additional fallback-bounds rect's=] position.
</div>


Validity {#anchor-valid}
--------

An ''anchor()'' function is a
<dfn lt="valid anchor function|invalid anchor function">valid anchor function</dfn>
only if all the following conditions are true:

* It's being used in an [=inset property=]
	on an [=absolutely-positioned=] element.
* If its <<anchor-side>> specifies a physical keyword,
	it's being used in an [=inset property=] in that axis.
	(For example, ''anchor()/left'' can only be used in 'left', 'right',
	or a logical [=inset property=] in the horizontal axis.)
* The result of determining the [=target anchor element=] is not nothing when
	given the querying element as the element it's used on,
	and the anchor specifier as
	the <<anchor-element>> value specified in the function.

If any of these conditions are false,
the ''anchor()'' function resolves to its specified fallback value.
If no fallback value is specified,
it resolves to ''0px''.

Anchor-based Sizing {#sizing}
===================

An [=absolutely-positioned=] element
can use the <dfn>anchor-size()</dfn> function
in its [=sizing properties=]
to refer to the size of one or more [=anchor elements=].
The ''anchor-size()'' function resolves to a <<length>>.

The ''anchor-size()'' Function {#anchor-size-fn}
------------------------------

<pre class=prod>
anchor-size() = anchor-size( <<anchor-element>>? <<anchor-size>>, <<length-percentage>>? )
<dfn><<anchor-size>></dfn> = width | height | block | inline | self-block | self-inline
</pre>

The ''anchor-size()'' function is similar to ''anchor()'',
and takes the same arguments,
save that the <<anchor-side>> keywords are replaced with <<anchor-size>>,
referring to the distance between two opposing sides.

The physical <<anchor-size>> keywords
(<dfn value for=anchor-size()>width</dfn>
and <dfn value for=anchor-size()>height</dfn>)
refer to the width and height,
respectively,
of the [=target anchor element=].
Unlike ''anchor()'', there is no restriction on having to match axises;
for example, ''width: anchor-size(--foo height);'' is valid.

The logical <<anchor-size>> keywords
(<dfn value for=anchor-size()>block</dfn>,
<dfn value for=anchor-size()>inline</dfn>,
<dfn value for=anchor-size()>self-block</dfn>,
and <dfn value for=anchor-size()>self-inline</dfn>)
map to one of the physical keywords
according to either the [=writing mode=] of the element
(for ''self-block'' and ''self-inline'')
or the [=writing mode=] of the element's [=containing block=]
(for ''anchor-size()/block'' and ''anchor-size()/inline'').

An ''anchor-size()'' function representing a [=valid anchor-size function=]
resolves to the <<length>> separating the relevant border edges
(either left and right, or top and bottom,
whichever is in the specified axis)
of the [=target anchor element=].

Validity {#anchor-size-valid}
--------

An ''anchor-size()'' function is a
<dfn lt="valid anchor-size function|invalid anchor-size function">valid anchor-size function</dfn>
only if all the following conditions are true:

* It's being used in a [=sizing property=]
	on an [=absolutely-positioned=] element.
* There is a [=target anchor element=]
	for the element it's used on,
	and the <<anchor-element>> value specified in the function.

If any of these conditions are false,
the ''anchor-size()'' function resolves to its specified fallback value.
If no fallback value is specified,
it resolves to ''0px''.

Overflow Management {#fallback}
===========================

Anchor positioning,
while powerful,
can also be unpredictable.
The [=anchor element=] might be anywhere on the page,
so positioning an element in any particular fashion
(such as above the anchor, or the right of the anchor)
might result in the positioned element overflowing its [=containing block=]
or being positioned partially off screen.

<s>To ameliorate this, an [=absolutely positioned=] element
can use the 'position-fallback' property
to refer to a ''@position-fallback'' block,
giving a list of possible style rules to try out.
Each is applied to the element, one by one,
and the first that doesn't cause the element
to overflow its [=containing block=]
is taken as the winner.</s>

Giving Fallback Options: the 'position-try-options' property {#position-try-options}
--------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: position-try-options
Value: none | [ <<dashed-ident>> || <<try-tactic>> ]#
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Applies to: [=absolutely-positioned=] elements
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

This property provides a list of alternate positioning styles
to try when the [=absolutely positioned box=]
overflows its [=inset-modified containing block=].
This <dfn export>position options list</dfn>
is initially empty.

Each comma-separated entry in the list is a separate option:
either the name of a ''@position-try'' block,
or a <<try-tactic>> representing an automatic transformation of the element's existing computed style.

Values have the following meanings:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=position-try-options>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	::
		The property has no effect;
		the element's [=position options list=] is empty.

	: <dfn><<dashed-ident>></dfn>
	::
		If there is a ''@position-try'' rule
		with the given name,
		its associated [=position option=]
		is added to the [=position options list=].

		Otherwise,
		this value has no effect.

	: <dfn><<try-tactic>></dfn>
	::
		Automatically creates a [=position option=]
		from the element's computed style,
		by swapping the
		[=margin property|margin=],
		[=sizing property|sizing=],
		[=inset property|inset=],
		and [=self-alignment property|self-alignment=] property values
		among the element's sides,
		and adds it to the [=position options list=].

		<pre class=prod>
		<dfn type><<try-tactic>></dfn> = flip-block || flip-inline || flip-start
		</pre>

		: <dfn>flip-block</dfn>
		::
			swaps the values in the [=block axis=]
			(between, for example, 'margin-block-start' and 'margin-block-end'),
			essentially mirroring across an [=inline-axis=] line.

		: <dfn>flip-inline</dfn>
		::
			swaps the values in the [=inline axis=],
			essentially mirroring across a [=block-axis=] line.

		: <dfn>flip-start</dfn>
		::
			swaps the values of the [=start=] properties with each other,
			and the [=end=] properties with each other
			(between, for example,
			'margin-block-start' and 'margin-inline-start'),
			essentially mirroring across a diagonal drawn
			from the [=block-start|start=]-[=inline-start|start=] corner
			to the [=block-end|end=]-[=inline-end|end=] corner.

		If multiple keywords are given,
		the transformations are composed in order
		to produce a single [=position option=].

		Issue: Define how the values themselves are changed upon flipping:
		anchor(top) becomes anchor(bottom);
		start becomes end;
		etc.

	: <dfn><<dashed-ident>> || <<try-tactic>></dfn>
	::
		Combines the effects of the previous two options:
		if there is a ''@position-try'' rule
		with the given name,
		then applies its [=position option=] to the element's base style,
		transforms it according to the specified <<try-tactic>>,
		and then adds the result
		to the element's [=position options list=].

		Otherwise, does nothing.
</dl>


Determining Fallback Order: the 'position-try-order' property {#position-try-order-property}
----------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: position-try-order
Value: normal | <<try-size>>
Initial: normal
Applies to: [=absolutely positioned elements=]
Inherited: no
Animation Type: discrete
</pre>

This property specifies the order in which
the [=position options list=] will be tried.

<pre class=prod>
<dfn type><<try-size>></dfn> = most-width | most-height | most-block-size | most-inline-size
</pre>

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=position-try-order>
	: <dfn>normal</dfn>
	::
		Try the [=position options=]
		in the order specified by 'position-try-options'.

	: <dfn>most-width</dfn>
	: <dfn>most-height</dfn>
	: <dfn>most-block-size</dfn>
	: <dfn>most-inline-size</dfn>
	::
		For each entry in the [=position options list=],
		[=determine the position fallback styles=],
		and find the specified [=inset-modified containing block=] size
		that results from those styles.
		Stably sort the [=position options list=]
		according to this size,
		with the largest coming first.
</dl>

<div class=example>
	For example, the following styles
	will initially position the popup list below its anchoring button,
	but if that overflows,
	will decide whether to keep the popup list below the anchor
	or move it above,
	depending on which option gives it the most space.

	<pre highlight=css>
	.anchor { anchor-name: --foo; }
	.list {
		position: fixed;
		anchor-default: --foo;
		top: anchor(bottom);
		left: anchor(left);
		align-self: start;
		position-try-options: --bottom-scrollable, flip-block, --top-scrollable;
		position-try-order: most-height;
	}
	@position-try --bottom-scrollable {
		align-self: stretch;
	}
	@position-try --top-scrollable {
		top: 0;
		bottom: anchor(top);
		align-self: stretch;
	}
	</pre>

	The ''flip-block'' auto-generated option and the ''--top-scrollable'' option
	will always find the same available height,
	since both of them stretch vertically from ''top: 0''
	(the top edge of the viewport)
	to ''bottom: anchor(top)''
	(the top of the anchor),
	so they'll retain their specified order.
	This causes the element to first try to align against the anchor
	at its natural height
	(using ''align-self: end'', auto-reversed from the base styles),
	but if that also causes overflow,
	it'll fall back to just filling the space
	and being scrollable instead.
</div>

<!--
Final Fallback Strategy: the 'position-try-final' property {#position-try-final-property}
----------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: position-try-final
Value: [ always? && [ first | <<try-size>> ] ] | hide
Initial: first
Applies to: [=absolutely positioned elements=]
Inherited: no
Animation Type: discrete
</pre>

When all options in the [=position options list=]
would result in the element overflowing its [=inset-modified containing block=],
this property determines which [=position option=] to use.

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=position-try-final>
	: <dfn>first</dfn>
	::
		Use the first option in the [=position options list=]
		(after sorting by 'position-try-order').

	: <dfn lt="<try-size> | most-width | most-height | most-block-size | most-inline-size"><<try-size>></dfn>
	::
		Stable sort the [=position options list=] as if this was the specified 'position-try-order',
		then use the first option.

	: <dfn>always</dfn>
	::
		If this keyword is <em>not</em> specified,
		and this box has previously been laid out
		with a [=position option=]
		that didn't result in overflow,
		use that option.

		Note: In other words, if all of the options cause the element to overflow,
		then by default
		the element will stay with the last successful [=position option=] it found
		that <em>didn't</em> cause overflow,
		keeping its position reasonably stable.
		With ''always'' specified, however,
		it will instead use the specified strategy
		to select the "fallback" [=position option=],
		regardless of what was previously successful.

	: <dfn>hide</dfn>
	::
		Use the first [=position option=] (as for ''first''),
		but also hide the box such that it (and all of its contents)
		are invisible (like ''visibility: hidden'')
		and do not contribute to [=scrollable overflow=].

The ''@position-try'' Rule {#fallback-rule}
-------------------------------

The <dfn>@position-try</dfn> rule
defines a <dfn>position option</dfn>
with a given name,
specifying one or more sets of positioning properties
that will be applied to an element
via 'position-try-options',

The syntax of the ''@position-try'' rule is:

<pre class=prod>
@position-try <<dashed-ident>> {
	<<declaration-list>>
}
</pre>

The <<dashed-ident>> specified in the prelude
is the rule's name.
If multiple ''@position-try'' rules are declared with the same name,
the last one in document order "wins".

Issue: Or should they cascade together?

The ''@position-try'' rule only <dfn lt="accepted @position-try properties">accepts</dfn>
the following [=properties=]:

* [=inset properties=]
* [=margin properties=]
* [=sizing properties=]
* [=self-alignment properties=]

Issue(#9195): What exactly are the constraints that determine what's allowed here?
Current list is based off of what's reasonable
from Chrome's experimental impl.
We can make a CQ that keys off of which fallback was used
to allow more general styling,
at least for descendants.

Issue(#7758): Would be useful to be able to detect
when your anchor(s) are fully off-screen
and suppress your display entirely.
For example, tooltips living outside the scroller
holding the text they're anchored to
don't want to just hover over arbitrary parts of the page
because their anchor happens to have that position
relative to the scrollport.

Note: If multiple elements using different anchors
want to use the same fallback positioning,
just relative to their own anchor elements,
omit the <<anchor-element>> in ''anchor()''
and specify each element's anchor in 'anchor-default' instead.

Note: The most common types of fallback positioning
(putting the positioned element on one side of the anchor normally,
but flipping to the opposite side if needed)
can be done automatically
with keywords in 'position-try-options',
without using ''@position-try'' at all.

Applying Stronger Fallback Bounds: the 'position-fallback-bounds' property {#fallback-bounds}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an element using [=anchor positioning=]
is using ''position: absolute'',
it determines whether or not it's overflowing
(and thus should try a different fallback position)
by looking at its (scroll-adjusted) [=inset-modified containing block=].
By carefully selecting where in the DOM
the positioned element lives,
and what element establishes its containing block,
you can choose a useful element
to use for its overflow bounds.

When using ''position: fixed'',
or things like the Popover API
that use the [=top layer=],
you lose this ability;
their containing block is always the viewport
or the root element's containing block.
The 'position-fallback-bounds' property
restores this ability,
allowing an element to explicitly select
what element it wants to use
for checking overflow against.

<pre class=propdef>
Name: position-fallback-bounds
Value: normal | <<dashed-ident>>
Initial: normal
Applies to: [=absolutely positioned=] elements
Inherited: no
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=position-fallback-bounds>
	: <dfn>normal</dfn>
	:: The element uses its normal (scroll-adjusted, inset-modified) containing block
		to determine if it's overflowing
		for the purpose of selecting a [=position options list=] entry.

	: <<dashed-ident>>
	::
		In addition to checking overflow against its containing block,
		as per ''position-fallback-bounds/normal'',
		the element checks against its <dfn dfn for>additional fallback-bounds rect</dfn>.

		The [=additional fallback-bounds rect=]
		is the [=padding box=]
		of the result of determining the [=target anchor element=]
		given this element and the specified <<dashed-ident>>.
		If there is no such [=target anchor element=],
		there is no [=additional fallback-bounds rect=].

		Issue: padding-box? Or content-box? Should it be controllable?
</dl>


Applying Position Fallback {#fallback-apply}
--------------------------

When a positioned element overflows its [=inset-modified containing block=],
and has a non-empty [=position options list=],
it selects one entry from the list
as defined below,
and applies those properties to itself as [=used values=].

Note: These have to be applied as used values
because we're in the middle of layout right now;
defining how they'd interact with the cascade
would be extremely confusing *at a minimum*,
and perhaps actually circular.
In any case, not worth the cost in spec or impl.

Issue: This implies that the values can't be transitioned in the usual fashion,
since transitions key off of computed values
and we're past that point.
However, popovers sliding between positions is a common effect in UI libs.
Probably should introduce a <css>smooth</css> keyword
to 'position-fallback'
to trigger automatic "animation" of the fallback'd properties.

<div algorithm>
	To <dfn>determine the position fallback styles</dfn> of an element |el|:

	1. Let |base styles| be the current used styles of |el|.

	2. [=list/For each=] |fallback styles| in the [=position options list=]:

		1. Apply the values of the [=accepted @position-try properties=]
			in |fallback styles| to |el|,
			overriding the corresponding properties in |base styles|.

			Perform any specified/computed/used-value time normalizations
			that are required to make the overridden styles into [=used values=]
			(such as resolving [=math functions=], etc).

			Let |adjusted styles|
			be |el|'s styles after these adjustments.

		2. Subtract |el|'s [=snapshotted scroll offset=]
			from |el|'s margin box's position.

			Also, if any of |el|'s [=inset properties=] are non-auto,
			subtract the [=snapshotted scroll offset=] for the appropriate axis
			from their values.
			Recalculate |el|'s [=inset-modified containing block=]
			using these shifted values
			to obtain the |scroll-adjusted IMCB|.

		3. If |el|'s [=margin box=] is not fully contained
			within the |scroll-adjusted IMCB|,
			[=iteration/continue=].

		4. If |el| has an [=additional fallback-bounds rect=],
			and |el|'s [=margin box=] is not fully contained within it,
			[=iteration/continue=].

		5. Use |adjusted styles| for |el|
			and exit this algorithm.

	3. If the previous step finished without selecting a set of styles,
		use the |adjusted styles|
		corresponding to the final entry in the [=position options list=].

	Note: Descendants overflowing |el|
	don't affect this calculation,
	only |el|'s own [=margin box=].
</div>

The styles returned by [=determining the position fallback styles=]
are taken as the final values for the specified properties.

Implementations may choose to impose an implementation-defined limit
on the length of [=position options lists=],
to limit the amount of excess layout work that may be required.
This limit must be <em>at least</em> five.

<div class=issue>
	Nested anchors
	(an anchored element inside of another anchored element)
	present the potential for exponential blow-up of layouts
	when doing fallback,
	since the grandchild anchored element can cause scrollbars on an ancestor,
	changing the IMCB for the child anchored element,
	thus possibly causing the fallback choice to change for it.

	There are strategies to avoid this,
	but they're not without costs of their own.
	We should <em>probably</em> impose a <strong>maximum</strong> limit as well,
	to avoid this.

	However, since *most* usages won't be problematic in the first place,
	we don't want to restrict them unduly
	just to prevent weird situations from exploding.
	Perhaps a complexity budget based on the branching factor at each level?
	Like, accumulate the product of the fallback list lengths from ancestors,
	and your fallback list gets limited to not exceed a total product
	of, say, 1k.
	Get too deep and you're stuck with your first choice only!
	But this would allow large, complex fallback lists for top-level stuff,
	and even some reasonable nesting.
	(Length-five lists could be nested to depth of 4, for example,
	if we did go with 1k.)

	More thought is needed.
</div>

<div class=example>
	For example,
	the following CSS will first attempt to position a "popover"
	below the [=element=],
	but if it doesn't fit on-screen will switch to being above;
	it defaults to left-aligning,
	but will switch to right-aligning if that doesn't fit.

	<pre highlight=css>
	#myPopover {
		position: fixed;
		position-fallback: --button-popover;
		overflow: auto;

		/* The popover is at least as wide as the button */
		min-width: anchor-size(--button width);

		/* The popover is at least as tall as 2 menu items */
		min-height: 6em;
	}

	@position-fallback --button-popover {
		/* First try to align the top, left edge of the popover
		with the bottom, left edge of the button. */
		@try {
			top: anchor(--button bottom);
			left: anchor(--button left);
		}

		/* Next try to align the bottom, left edge of the popover
		with the top, left edge of the button. */
		@try {
			bottom: anchor(--button top);
			left: anchor(--button left);
		}

		/* Next try to align the top, right edge of the popover
		with the bottom, right edge of the button. */
		@try {
			top: anchor(--button bottom);
			right: anchor(--button right);
		}

		/* Finally, try to align the bottom, right edge of the popover
		with the top, right edge of the button. Other positions are possible,
		but this is the final option the author would like the rendering
		engine to try. */
		@try {
			bottom: anchor(--button top);
			right: anchor(--button right);
		}
	}
