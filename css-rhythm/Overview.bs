Introduction {#intro}
=====================

	This specification provides features to control sizes of CSS objects
	according to the rules desired by use cases.

	Controlling sizes of CSS objects to be multiple of a unit
	is desired in many cases.
	This level of the specification focuses on following cases.

	* Adjust heights of line boxes to multiples of the specified length.
	* Adjust heights of block-level boxes to multiples of the specified length.

	By controlling heights of line boxes,
	lines of text in different fonts can create consistent visuals
	to help readability.

	Also by stacking such line boxes,
	authors can align lines across columns,
	pages, scroll-snapped blocks, or multiple blocks placed absolutely,
	to produce vertical rhythm.

	<div class="figure">
		<a href="examples/snap-height.html">
			<img src="images/snap-height-sample.png"></a>
		<p class="caption">Vertical rhythm kept through pictures and different size of text in a multi-column document.
	</div>

Adjusting Line Box Heights: the 'line-height-step' property {#line-height-step}
===============================================================================

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: line-height-step
	Value: none | <<length>>
	Initial: none
	Applies to: block containers
	Inherited: yes
	Animatable: no
	Percentages: N/A
	Media: visual
	Computed Value: the absolute length, 0 for none
	</pre>

	This property defines the <dfn>step unit</dfn> for line box heights.
	When the <a>step unit</a> is set to a positive <<length>>,
	the line box heights are rounded <i>up</i> to
	the closest multiple of the unit.
	Negative <<length>> values are invalid.

	[[!CSS21]] <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visudet.html#line-height">&#xA7;10.8 Line height calculations</a>
	defines how to compute the height of a line box from its inline-level content.
	The rounding is applied to the resulting height of the line box,
	and the additional space is distributed to
	<a>over</a>-side and <a>under</a>-side of the line box equally,
	so that the original line box appears at the center of the
	multiple of <a>step unit</a>.
	This adjustment is done
	by assuming that there is an inline-level box that has adjusted A' and D'
	in the line box.

	<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/adjust-line-height.svg">
	<p class="caption">Rounding up the computed line box height.
	</div>

	<div class="issue">Should this be animatable?
	There doesn't seem to be use cases but needed for consistency?</div>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="figure" style="float:right">
			<img src="images/line-grid-center.svg"
			style="height: 300px"
			>
		</div>

		In the following example,
		the height of line box in each paragraph is rounded up to the <a>step unit</a>.

		<pre class="lang-css">
			:root {
			  font-size: 12pt;
			  --my-grid: 18pt;
			  line-height-step: var(--my-grid);
			}
			h1 {
			  font-size: 20pt;
			  margin-top: calc(2 * var(--my-grid));
			}
			p {
			  margin: 0;
			}
		</pre>

		The line box in <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> does not fit into one <a>step unit</a>
		and thus occupies two,
		but it is still centered within the two <a>step unit</a>.
	</div>

	<div class="example">
	Authors can keep margins or other properties to be multiple of <a>step unit</a>
	using ''var()'' and ''calc()'' as in the example above.

	If author prefers,
	tools like Sass can make such declarations shorter.

		<pre class="lang-css">
		  $gu: 18px;

		  @function gu($n) {
		    @return $n * $gu;
		  }

		  h1 {
		    font-size: 20pt;
		    margin: gu(1.2) auto gu(1.8);
		  }
		</pre>
	</div>

	<div class="note">
	It is usually recommended to set the 'line-height' lower than
	the <a>step unit</a>.
	The used line height can increase due to several factors such as
	the use of 'vertical-align' or font fallback.
	</div>

<!--
Notes on Block-level Boxes {#inline-block}
------------------------------------------

	<i>This section is not normative.</i>

	This level of the specification does not provide features
	to adjust heights of block-level boxes.

	<div class="example">
	The following CSS turns <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> to inline-blocks,
	so that the 'line-height-step' property can control its height.

	<pre class="lang-css">
	:root {
	  line-height-step: 18pt;
	}
	h2 {
	  display: inline-block;
	  width: 100%;
	  line-height-step: 0;
	  line-height: 1.2;
	}
	</pre>

	When an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> is long enough to wrap,
	text inside the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> uses ''line-height: 1.2'', while
	the height of the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> block is rounded up
	to the multiple of ''18pt''.
	See <a href="examples/snap-height.html">a sample in action</a>.
	</div>

Adjusting Block-level Box Heights {#block-height}
=================================

	ISSUE: This proposal can be simplified down to just the 'block-step-size' property, represented solely through its shortened form as 'block-step'.
	This level will likely at most contain 'block-step-size' and 'block-step-insert', leaving 'block-step-align' and 'block-step-round' to be added if the future demands.
	The full design is described herein for current discussion and future reference.

	ISSUE: This proposal is currently defined to apply only to block-level boxes. This limitation is solely to simplify the first iteration; it should eventually be extended to all layout modes that honor specified heights.

Specifying the Step Size: the 'block-step-size' property {#block-step-size}
--------------------------------------------------------

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: block-step-size
	Value: none | <<length>>
	Initial: none
	Applies to: block-level boxes
	Inherited: no
	Animatable: ???
	Percentages: N/A
	Media: visual
	Computed Value: keyword or absolute length
	</pre>

	This property defines the <a>step unit</a> for a block-level box’s <a>block size</a>.
	When the <a>step unit</a> is set to a positive <<length>>,
	the box’s outer height is rounded
	(see 'block-step-round')
	to the closest multiple of the unit.
	Negative <<length>> values are invalid.

	Values other than ''block-step-size/none''
	cause the box to establish a new formatting context.

	In situations where margins <a href="">collapse</a>,
	only the box’s own margin is considered
	in calculating its outer size.

Specifying the Spacing Type: the 'block-step-insert' property {#block-step-insert}
--------------------------------------------------------

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: block-step-insert
	Value: margin | padding
	Initial: margin
	Applies to: block-level boxes
	Inherited: no
	Animatable: no
	Percentages: N/A
	Media: visual
	Computed Value: as specified
	</pre>

	This property specifies whether extra spacing
	derived from applying 'block-step-size'
	is inserted inside (like 'padding') or outside (like 'margin')
	the box’s border.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for="block-step-insert" dfn-type="value">
		<dt><dfn>margin</dfn>
		<dd>
			Any extra space resulting from a 'block-step-size'-induced adjustment
			is inserted outside the box’s border, as extra margin.

		<dt><dfn>padding</dfn>
		<dd>
			Any extra space resulting from a 'block-step-size'-induced adjustment
			is inserted inside the box’s border, as extra padding.
	</dl>

Specifying Alignment: the 'block-step-align' property {#block-step-align}
-----------------------------------------------------

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: block-step-align
	Value: auto | center | start | end
	Initial: auto
	Applies to: block-level boxes
	Inherited: no
	Animatable: no
	Percentages: N/A
	Media: visual
	Computed Value: as specified
	</pre>

	This property specifies whether extra spacing
	derived from applying 'block-step-size'
	is inserted before, inserted after, or split between both sides of the box.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for="block-step-align" dfn-type="value">
		<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			If 'block-step-insert' is ''margin'':
			if 'align-self' is ''start'', ''end'', or ''center'', treat as that value,
			otherwise treat as ''center''.

		<dt><dfn>center</dfn>
		<dd>
			Any extra space resulting from a 'block-step-size'-induced adjustment
			is split, and applied half on either side of the box.
		<dt><dfn>start</dfn>
		<dd>
			Any extra space resulting from a 'block-step-size'-induced adjustment
			is inserted on the <a>start</a> side of the box.
		<dt><dfn>end</dfn>
		<dd>
			Any extra space resulting from a 'block-step-size'-induced adjustment
			is inserted on the <a>end</a> side of the box.
	</dl>

Rounding Method: the 'block-step-round' property {#block-step-round}
------------------------------------------------

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: block-step-round
	Value: up | down | nearest
	Initial: up
	Applies to: block-level boxes
	Inherited: no
	Animatable: no
	Percentages: N/A
	Media: visual
	Computed Value: as specified
	</pre>

	This property specifies whether adjustments due to 'block-step-size'
	insert positive or negative space.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for="block-step-align" dfn-type="value">
		<dt><dfn>up</dfn>
		<dd>
			The outer size of the box is <em>increased</em>
			(positive space is inserted)
			to fulfill the 'block-step-size' constraint.

		<dt><dfn>down</dfn>
		<dd>
			The outer size of the box is <em>decreased</em>
			(negative space is inserted)
			to fulfill the 'block-step-size' constraint.

		<dt><dfn>nearest</dfn>
		<dd>
			The outer size of the box is either
			<em>increased</em> (as for ''up'') or <em>decreased</em> (as for ''down''--
			whichever results in the smallest absolute change--
			to fulfill the 'block-step-size' constraint.
			If both options would result in the same amount of change,
			the size is increased.
	</dl>

Block Step Adjustment Shorthand: the 'block-step' shorthand {#block-step}
-----------------------------------------------------------

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: block-step
	Value: <'block-step-size'> || <'block-step-insert'> || <'block-step-align'> || <'block-step-round'>
	Initial: See individual properties
	Applies to: block-level boxes
	Inherited: no
	Animatable: See individual properties
	Percentages: N/A
	Media: visual
	Computed Value: See individual properties
	</pre>

	This <a>shorthand property</a> allows for setting
	'block-step-size',
	'block-step-insert',
	'block-step-align',
	and
	'block-step-round'
	in one declaration.
	Omitted values are set to the property’s initial value.

	Advisement: Authors are advised to use this shorthand rather than the longhands
	unless there is a specific need for its individual longhands to cascade independently.
