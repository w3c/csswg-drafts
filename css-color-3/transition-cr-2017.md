## Decision to request transition

  - RESOLUTION: Publish new CR of Color L3

[minutes, 22 Nov 2017 telcon](https://www.w3.org/2017/11/22-css-minutes.html#item03)

## Changes

[Changes since the 07 June 2011 W3C Recommendation](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-3/#changes)

## Requirements satisfied

There is no specific requirements document for this specification. The work
is within the scope defined in the CSS WG's charter.

## Dependencies met (or not)

All normative references are either W3C Recommendations, or other International Standards.


## Wide Review

The one substantive erratum has been agreed by the CSS WG and by browser vendors; there are now two implementations which conform to it, and others are expected to follow suit.


## Issues addressed

All issues which would result in a new feature were deferred to CSS Color 4, so there are [no open CSS Color 3 issues](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels/css-color-3) and thus, no Disposition of Comments.

## Formal Objections

None

## Implementation

[Test suite](https://test.csswg.org/harness/suite/css-color-3_dev/)

The [implementation report](https://test.csswg.org/harness/results/css-color-3_dev/grouped/) shows that
75 of 75 required tests meet CR exit criteria.

More relevantly for this transition, there is [one test](https://test.csswg.org/harness/test/css-color-3_dev/single/t44-currentcolor-inherited-c/) for the substantive change, which is [passed by two implementations](https://test.csswg.org/harness/results/css-color-3_dev/grouped/t44-currentcolor-inherited-c/).

## Patent disclosures
