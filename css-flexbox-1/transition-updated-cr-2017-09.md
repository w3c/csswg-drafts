## Wide Review

The document went through a (2005 process) Last Call in 2012,
and then transitioned to CR. It was returned to LC in 2014 to
process further comments due to implementation experience
(per 2005 process rules), and transitioned back to CR 
under the new process in early 2016. It was updated in May 2016.

There has now been additional implementation feedback 
from multiple browsers. All current feedback (bar one item, see below) has 
been addressed and collected in the latest Disposition 
of Comments, so we would like to publish a new CR.

## Issues addressed

The [Disposition of Comments](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox-1/issues-cr-20160526) shows 45 issues.

[Issue 34](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1322) is still open. The CSS WG would like to publish 
an updated CR to allow wider review of the updated document, while this issue is further discussed.

:boom: issue 42 is still marked as open, but the issue is closed and verified 

## Formal Objections

None

## Implementation

The [testsuite](https://test.csswg.org/harness/results/css-flexbox-1_dev/grouped/) shows that
687 of 687 required tests meet CR exit criteria.

:boom: test for changes from https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1735 ?

:boom: any other changes in the changes section invalidated existing tests, or need new tests?

## Patent disclosures
