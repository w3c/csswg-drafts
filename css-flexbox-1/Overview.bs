Abstract: The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.

Introduction</h2>

	<em>This section is not normative.</em>

	CSS 2.1 defined four layout modes &mdash; algorithms which determine
	the size and position of boxes based on their relationships
	with their sibling and ancestor boxes:

	* block layout, designed for laying out documents
	* inline layout, designed for laying out text
	* table layout, designed for laying out 2D data in a tabular format
	* positioned layout, designed for very explicit positioning without much regard for other elements in the document

	This module introduces a new layout mode, <dfn export>flex layout</dfn>,
	which is designed for laying out more complex applications and webpages.

<h3 id="overview">
Overview</h3>

	<em>This section is not normative.</em>

	Flex layout is superficially similar to block layout.
	It lacks many of the more complex text- or document-centric properties
	that can be used in block layout, such as
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#floats">floats</a> and
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/">columns</a>.
	In return it gains simple and powerful tools
	for distributing space and aligning content
	in ways that web apps and complex web pages often need.
	The contents of a flex container:

	* can be laid out in any <a href="#flex-direction-property">flow direction</a>
		(leftwards, rightwards, downwards, or even upwards!)
	* can have their display order <a value for="flex-direction" lt="row-reverse">reversed</a> or
		<a href="#order-property">rearranged</a> at the style layer
		(i.e., visual order can be independent of source and speech order)
	* can be laid out linearly along a single (<a lt="main axis">main</a>) axis or
		<a href="#flex-wrap-property">wrapped</a> into multiple lines along a secondary (<a lt="cross axis">cross</a>) axis
	* can <a href="#flexibility">&ldquo;flex&rdquo; their sizes</a>
		to respond to the available space
	* can be <a href="#alignment">aligned</a> with respect to their container or each other on the secondary (<a lt="cross axis">cross</a>)
	* can be dynamically <a href="#visibility-collapse">collapsed</a> or uncollapsed
		along the <a>main axis</a> while preserving the container's <a>cross size</a>

	<div class='example'>
		Here's an example of a catalog where each item has a title, a photo, a description, and a purchase button.
		The designer's intention is that each entry has the same overall size,
		that the photo be above the text,
		and that the purchase buttons are aligned at the bottom, regardless of the length of the item's description.
		Flex layout makes many aspects of this design easy:

		* The catalog uses flex layout to lay out rows of items horizontally,
			and to ensure that items within a row are all equal-height.
			Each entry is then itself a column flex container,
			laying out its contents vertically.

		* Within each entry, the source document content is ordered logically
			with the title first, followed by the description and the photo.
			This provides a sensible ordering for speech rendering and in non-CSS browsers.
			For a more compelling visual presentation, however,
			'order' is used to pull the image up from later in the content to the top,
			and 'align-self' is used to center it horizontally.

		* An <a href="#auto-margins"><css>auto</css> margin</a> above the purchase button
			forces it to the bottom within each entry box,
			regardless of the height of that item's description.

		<pre class="lang-css">
		#deals {
			display: flex;        /* Flex layout so items <a property lt="align-self">have equal height</a>  */
			flex-flow: row wrap;  /* <a section href="#flex-flow-property">Allow items to wrap into multiple lines</a> */
		}
		.sale-item {
			display: flex;        /* Lay out each item using flex layout */
			flex-flow: column;    /* <a section href="#flex-flow-property">Lay out item's contents vertically</a>  */
		}
		.sale-item > img {
			order: -1;            /* <a section href="#order-property">Shift image before other content (in visual order)</a> */
			align-self: center;   /* <a property lt="align-self">Center the image cross-wise (horizontally)</a>         */
		}
		.sale-item > button {
			margin-top: auto;     /* <a section href="#auto-margins">Auto top margin pushes button to bottom</a> */

Module interactions</h3>

	This module extends the definition of the 'display' property [[!CSS2]],
	adding a new block-level and new inline-level display type,
	and defining a new type of formatting context
	along with properties to control its layout.
	None of the properties defined in this module apply to the ''::first-line'' or ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements.

	The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-align/">CSS Box Alignment Module</a>
	extends and supersedes the definitions of the alignment properties
	('justify-content', 'align-items', 'align-self', 'align-content')
	introduced here.

<h3 id="values">
Value Definitions</h3>

	This specification follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]]
	using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs">value definition syntax</a> from [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values &amp; Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification
	also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> as their property value.
	For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

<h2 id='box-model'>
Flex Layout Box Model and Terminology</h2>

	A <dfn export>flex container</dfn> is the box generated by an element with a
	computed 'display' of ''flex'' or ''inline-flex''.
	In-flow children of a flex container are called <dfn export lt="flex item" id="flex-item">flex items</dfn>
	and are laid out using the flex layout model.

	Unlike block and inline layout,
	whose layout calculations are biased to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#abstract-box">block and inline flow directions</a>,
	flex layout is biased to the <dfn export lt="flex direction">flex directions</dfn>.
	To make it easier to talk about flex layout,
	this section defines a set of flex flow&ndash;relative terms.
	The 'flex-flow' value and the <a>writing mode</a>
	determine how these terms map
	to physical directions (top/right/bottom/left),
	axes (vertical/horizontal), and sizes (width/height).

Flex Containers: the ''flex'' and ''inline-flex'' 'display' values</h2>

	<pre class="propdef partial">
	Name: display
	New values: flex | inline-flex
	</pre>

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=display>
		<dt><dfn>flex</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value causes an element to generate a <a>flex container</a> box
			that is <a>block-level</a> when placed in <a>flow layout</a>.

			<wpt>
				display-flex-001.htm
				display_flex_exist.html
			</wpt>

		<dt><dfn>inline-flex</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value causes an element to generate a <a>flex container</a> box
			that is <a>inline-level</a> when placed in <a>flow layout</a>.

			<wpt>
				display_inline-flex_exist.html
			</wpt>
	</dl>

	A <a>flex container</a> establishes a new <dfn export>flex formatting context</dfn> for its contents.
	This is the same as establishing a block formatting context,
	except that flex layout is used instead of block layout.
	For example, floats do not intrude into the flex container,
	and the flex container's margins do not collapse with the margins of its contents.
	<a>Flex containers</a> form a containing block for their contents
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#containing-block-details">exactly like block containers do</a>. [[!CSS2]]
	The 'overflow' property applies to <a>flex containers</a>.

	Flex containers are not block containers,
	and so some properties that were designed with the assumption of block layout don't apply in the context of flex layout.
	In particular:

		* 'float' and 'clear' do not create floating or clearance of <a>flex item</a>,
			and do not take it out-of-flow.
		* 'vertical-align' has no effect on a flex item.
		* the ''::first-line'' and ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements do not apply to <a>flex containers</a>,
			and <a>flex containers</a> do not contribute a <a>first formatted line</a> or <a>first letter</a>
			to their ancestors.

			<!--
			Issue: When the Pseudo-Elements spec exists,
			align this language with whatever algo we define for figuring out where to search for first-line/letter content.
			-->

	If an element's specified 'display' is ''inline-flex'',
	then its 'display' property computes to ''flex''
	in certain circumstances:
	the table in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">CSS 2.1 Section 9.7</a>
	is amended to contain an additional row,
	with ''inline-flex'' in the "Specified Value" column
	and ''flex'' in the "Computed Value" column.

Flex Items</h2>

	Loosely speaking, the <a>flex items</a> of a <a>flex container</a>
	are boxes representing its in-flow contents.

	Each in-flow child of a <a>flex container</a>
	becomes a <a>flex item</a>,
	and each contiguous sequence of child <a>text runs</a>
	is wrapped in an <a>anonymous</a> <a>block container</a> <a>flex item</a>.
	However, if the entire sequence of child <a>text runs</a> contains only
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/text.html#white-space-prop">white space</a>
	(i.e. characters that can be affected by the 'white-space' property)
	it is instead not rendered (just as if its <a>text nodes</a> were ''display:none'').

		Note that the inter-element white space disappears:
		it does not become its own flex item,
		even though the inter-element text <em>does</em> get wrapped in an anonymous flex item.

		Note also that the anonymous item's box is unstyleable,
		since there is no element to assign style rules to.
		Its contents will however inherit styles (such as font settings) from the flex container.
	</div>

	A <a>flex item</a> [=establishes an independent formatting context=] for its contents.
	However, flex items themselves are <dfn export>flex-level</dfn> boxes, not block-level boxes:
	they participate in their container's flex formatting context,
	not in a block formatting context.

	<hr>

	Note: Authors reading this spec may want to
	<a href="#item-margins">skip past the following box-generation and static position details</a>.

	If the [=computed value|computed=] 'display' value of an element's nearest ancestor element
	(skipping ''display:contents'' ancestors)
	is ''flex'' or ''inline-flex'',
	the element's own 'display' value is [=blockified=].
	(See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">CSS2.1&sect;9.7</a> [[!CSS2]]
	and [[css-display-3#transformations]]
	for details on this type of 'display' value conversion.)

	Note: Blockification still occurs even when the ''flex'' or ''inline-flex'' element does not end up generating a [=flex container=] box,
	e.g. when it is [=replaced element|replaced=]
	or in a ''display: none'' subtree.

	Note: Some values of 'display' normally trigger the creation of anonymous boxes around the original box.
	If such a box is a <a>flex item</a>,
	it is blockified first,
	and so anonymous box creation will not happen.
	For example, two contiguous <a>flex items</a> with ''display: table-cell''
	will become two separate ''display: block'' <a>flex items</a>,
	instead of being wrapped into a single anonymous table.

	In the case of flex items with ''display: table'',
	the table wrapper box becomes the <a>flex item</a>,
	and the 'order' and 'align-self' properties apply to it.
	The contents of any caption boxes contribute to the calculation of
	the table wrapper box's min-content and max-content sizes.
	However, like 'width' and 'height', the 'flex' longhands apply to the table box as follows:
	the <a>flex item</a>’s final size is calculated
	by performing layout as if the distance between
	the table wrapper box's edges and the table box's content edges
	were all part of the table box's border+padding area,
	and the table box were the <a>flex item</a>.

<h3 id='abspos-items'>
Absolutely-Positioned Flex Children</h3>

	As it is out-of-flow,
	an absolutely-positioned child of a <a>flex container</a> does not participate in flex layout.

	The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#abs-non-replaced-width">static position</a>
	of an absolutely-positioned child of a <a>flex container</a>
	is determined such that the child is positioned
	as if it were the sole <a>flex item</a> in the <a>flex container</a>,
	assuming both the child and the flex container
	were fixed-size boxes of their used size.
	For this purpose,
	''margin/auto'' margins are treated as zero.

		abspos-autopos-vlr-rtl.html
		abspos-autopos-vrl-ltr.html
		abspos-autopos-vrl-rtl.html
	</wpt>

	<div class="note">
		In other words,
		the <a>static-position rectangle</a> of an absolutely-positioned child of a <a>flex container</a>
		is the <a>flex container's</a> content box,
		where the <dfn>static-position rectangle</dfn> is the <a>alignment container</a>
		used to determine the static-position offsets of an absolutely-positioned box.

		(In block layout the static position rectangle corresponds to the position of the “hypothetical box”
		described in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#abs-non-replaced-width">CSS2.1&sect;10.3.7</a>.
		Since it has no alignment properties,
		CSS2.1 always uses a <a>block-start</a> <a>inline-start</a> alignment
		of the absolutely-positioned box within the <a>static-position rectangle</a>.
		Note that this definition will eventually move to the CSS Positioning module.)
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		The effect of this is that if you set, for example,
		''align-self: center;'' on an absolutely-positioned child of a <a>flex container</a>,
		auto offsets on the child will center it in the <a>flex container's</a> <a>cross axis</a>.

		However, since the absolutely-positioned box is considered to be “fixed-size”,
		a value of ''align-self/stretch'' is treated the same as ''align-self/flex-start''.
	</div>

<h3 id='item-margins'>
Flex Item Margins and Paddings</h3>

	The margins of adjacent <a>flex items</a> do not
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins">collapse</a>.

	Percentage margins and paddings on <a>flex items</a>,
	like those on <a>block boxes</a>,
	are resolved against the <a>inline size</a> of their <a>containing block</a>,
	e.g. left/right/top/bottom percentages
	all resolve against their <a>containing block</a>’s <em>width</em>
	in horizontal <a>writing modes</a>.

	Auto margins expand to absorb extra space in the corresponding dimension.
	They can be used for alignment,
	or to push adjacent flex items apart.
	See <a href="#auto-margins">Aligning with <span class=css>auto</span> margins</a>.

<h3 id='painting'>
Flex Item Z-Ordering</h3>

	<a>Flex items</a> paint exactly the same as inline blocks [[!CSS2]],
	except that 'order'-modified document order is used in place of raw document order,
	and 'z-index'
	values other than ''z-index/auto'' create a stacking context
	even if 'position' is ''static''
	(behaving exactly as if 'position' were ''relative'').

	Note: Descendants that are positioned outside a flex item still participate
	in any stacking context established by the flex item.

<h3 id='visibility-collapse'>
Collapsed Items</h3>

	Specifying ''visibility:collapse'' on a flex item
	causes it to become a <dfn export lt="collapsed flex item" local-lt="collapsed">collapsed flex item</dfn>,
	producing an effect similar to ''visibility:collapse'' on a table-row or table-column:
	the [=collapsed flex item=] is removed from rendering entirely,
	but leaves behind a "strut" that keeps the flex line's cross-size stable.
	Thus, if a flex container has only one flex line,
	dynamically collapsing or uncollapsing items
	may change the <a>flex container</a>'s <a>main size</a>, but
	is guaranteed to have no effect on its <a>cross size</a>
	and won't cause the rest of the page's layout to "wobble".
	Flex line wrapping <em>is</em> re-done after collapsing, however,
	so the cross-size of a flex container with multiple lines might or might not change.

	Though [=collapsed flex items=] aren't rendered,
	they do appear in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/intro.html#formatting-structure">formatting structure</a>.
	Therefore, unlike on ''display:none'' items [[!CSS2]],
	effects that depend on a box appearing in the formatting structure
	(like incrementing counters or running animations and transitions)
	still operate on collapsed items.

	<div class="example">
		In the following example,
		a sidebar is sized to fit its content.
		''visibility: collapse'' is used to dynamically hide parts of a navigation sidebar
		without affecting its width, even though the widest item (&ldquo;Architecture&rdquo;)
		is in a collapsed section.

	To compute the size of the strut, flex layout is first performed with all items uncollapsed,
	and then re-run with each [=collapsed flex item=] replaced by a strut that maintains
	the original cross-size of the item's original line.
	See the <a href="#layout-algorithm">Flex Layout Algorithm</a>
	for the normative definition of how ''visibility:collapse''
	interacts with flex layout.

	Note: Using ''visibility:collapse'' on any flex items
	will cause the flex layout algorithm to repeat partway through,
	re-running the most expensive steps.
	It's recommended that authors continue to use ''display:none'' to hide items
	if the items will not be dynamically collapsed and uncollapsed,
	as that is more efficient for the layout engine.
	(Since only part of the steps need to be repeated when 'visibility' is changed,
	however, 'visibility: collapse' is still recommended for dynamic cases.)

<h3 id="min-size-auto">
Automatic Minimum Size of Flex Items</h3>

	Note: The ''min-width/auto'' keyword,
	representing an <a>automatic minimum size</a>,
	is the new initial value of the 'min-width' and 'min-height' properties.
	The keyword was previously defined in this specification,
	but is now defined in the [[!CSS-SIZING-3|CSS Sizing]] module.

	To provide a more reasonable default <a>minimum size</a> for <a>flex items</a>,
	the used value of a <a>main axis</a> <a>automatic minimum size</a>
	on a <a>flex item</a> that is not a <a>scroll container</a>
	is a <dfn>content-based minimum size</dfn>;
	for <a>scroll containers</a> the <a>automatic minimum size</a> is zero, as usual.

	In general, the <a>content-based minimum size</a> of a <a>flex item</a>
	is the smaller of its <a>content size suggestion</a> and its <a>specified size suggestion</a>.
	However, if the box has an [=preferred aspect ratio|aspect ratio=] and no <a>specified size suggestion</a>,
	its <a>content-based minimum size</a>
	is the smaller of its <a>content size suggestion</a> and its <a>transferred size suggestion</a>.
	If the box has neither a <a>specified size suggestion</a> nor an [=preferred aspect ratio|aspect ratio=],
	its <a>content-based minimum size</a> is the <a>content size suggestion</a>.
	In all cases, the size is clamped by the [=maximum size|maximum=] [=main size=] if it's <a>definite</a>.

	The <a>content size suggestion</a>, <a>specified size suggestion</a>, and <a>transferred size suggestion</a>
	used in this calculation account for the relevant min/max/preferred size properties
	so that the <a>content-based minimum size</a> does not interfere with any author-provided constraints,
	and are defined below:

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn>specified size suggestion</dfn>
		<dd>
			If the item’s [=preferred size|preferred=] [=main size=] is <a>definite</a>,
			then the <a>specified size suggestion</a> is that size.
			It is otherwise undefined.

		<dt><dfn>transferred size suggestion</dfn>
		<dd>
			If the item has a [=preferred aspect ratio=]
			and its [=preferred size|preferred=] [=cross size=] is <a>definite</a>,
			then the <a>transferred size suggestion</a> is that size
			(clamped by its [=minimum size|minimum=] and [=maximum size|maximum=] [=cross sizes=] if they are <a>definite</a>),
			converted through the aspect ratio.
			It is otherwise undefined.

		<dt><dfn>content size suggestion</dfn>
		<dd>
			The <a>content size suggestion</a> is the <a>min-content size</a> in the <a>main axis</a>,
			clamped, if it has a [=preferred aspect ratio=],
			by any <a>definite</a> [=minimum size|minimum=] and [=maximum size|maximum=] [=cross sizes=] converted through the aspect ratio.
	</dl>

	For the purpose of calculating an intrinsic size of the box
	(e.g. the box’s <a>min-content size</a>),
	a <a>content-based minimum size</a> causes the box’s size in that axis to become indefinite
	(even if e.g. its 'width' property specifies a <a>definite</a> size).
	Note this means that percentages calculated against this size
	will [=behave as auto=].

	Nonetheless, although this may require an additional layout pass to re-resolve percentages in some cases,
	this value
	(like the ''min-content'', ''max-content'', and ''fit-content'' values defined in [[CSS-SIZING-3]])
	does not prevent the resolution of percentage sizes within the item.

	<div class="note" id="min-size-opt">
		Note that while a content-based minimum size is often appropriate,
		and helps prevent content from overlapping or spilling outside its container,
		in some cases it is not:

		In particular, if flex sizing is being used for a major content area of a document,
		it is better to set an explicit font-relative minimum width such as ''min-width: 12em''.
		A content-based minimum width could result in a large table or large image
		stretching the size of the entire content area into an overflow zone,
		and thereby making lines of text gratuitously long and hard to read.

		Note also, when content-based sizing is used on an item with large amounts of content,
		the layout engine must traverse all of this content before finding its minimum size,
		whereas if the author sets an explicit minimum, this is not necessary.
		(For items with small amounts of content, however,
		this traversal is trivial and therefore not a performance concern.)
	</div>


<h2 id="flow-order">
Ordering and Orientation</h2>

	The contents of a flex container can be laid out in any direction and in any order.
	This allows an author to trivially achieve effects that would previously have required complex or fragile methods,
	such as hacks using the 'float' and 'clear' properties.
	This functionality is exposed through the 'flex-direction', 'flex-wrap', and 'order' properties.

	Note: The reordering capabilities of flex layout intentionally affect
	<em>only the visual rendering</em>,
	leaving speech order and navigation based on the source order.
	This allows authors to manipulate the visual presentation
	while leaving the source order intact for non-CSS UAs and for
	linear models such as speech and sequential navigation.
	See <a href="#order-accessibility">Reordering and Accessibility</a>
	and the <a href="#overview">Flex Layout Overview</a> for examples
	that use this dichotomy to improve accessibility.

	Advisement:
	Authors <em>must not</em> use 'order' or the ''*-reverse'' values of 'flex-flow'/'flex-direction'
	as a substitute for correct source ordering,
	as that can ruin the accessibility of the document.

<h3 id='order-property'>
Display Order: the 'order' property</h3>

	<a>Flex items</a> are, by default, displayed and laid out in the same order as they appear in the source document.
	The 'order' property can be used to change this ordering.

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: order
	Value: <<integer>>
	Initial: 0
	Applies to: <a>flex items</a>
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: specified integer
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	<wpt>
		Flexible-order.html
	</wpt>

	The 'order' property controls the order in which
	flex items appear within the flex container,
	by assigning them to ordinal groups.
	It takes a single <dfn value for=order><<integer>></dfn> value,
	which specifies which ordinal group the <a>flex item</a> belongs to.

	A flex container lays out its content in <dfn export>order-modified document order</dfn>,
	starting from the lowest numbered ordinal group and going up.
	Items with the same ordinal group are laid out in the order they appear in the source document.
	This also affects the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/zindex.html">painting order</a> [[!CSS2]],
	exactly as if the flex items were reordered in the source document.
	Absolutely-positioned children of a <a>flex container</a>
	are treated as having ''order: 0''
	for the purpose of determining their painting order relative to <a>flex items</a>.

	<div class='example'>
		The following figure shows a simple tabbed interface, where the tab for the active pane is always first:

		<figure><img src="images/flex-order-example.png" alt></figure>

		This could be implemented with the following CSS (showing only the relevant code):

		<pre class="lang-css">
			.tabs {
				display: flex;
			}
			.tabs > .current {
				order: -1; /* Lower than the default of 0 */
			}
		</pre>
	</div>

	Unless otherwise specified by a future specification,
	this property has no effect on boxes that are not <a>flex items</a>.

<h4 id="order-accessibility">
Reordering and Accessibility</h4>

	The 'order' property <em>does not</em> affect ordering in non-visual media
	(such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-speech/">speech</a>).
	Likewise, 'order' does not affect
	the default traversal order of sequential navigation modes
	(such as cycling through links, see e.g. <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#attr-tabindex"><code>tabindex</code></a> [[HTML]]).

	Advisement:
	Authors <em>must</em> use 'order' only for visual, not logical, reordering of content.
	Style sheets that use 'order' to perform logical reordering are non-conforming.

	Note: This is so that non-visual media and non-CSS UAs,
	which typically present content linearly,
	can rely on a logical source order,
	while 'order' is used to tailor the visual order.
	(Since visual perception is two-dimensional and non-linear,
	the desired visual order is not always logical.)

	<div class='example'>
		Many web pages have a similar shape in the markup,
		with a header on top,
		a footer on bottom,
		and then a content area and one or two additional columns in the middle.
		Generally,
		it's desirable that the content come first in the page's source code,
		before the additional columns.
		However, this makes many common designs,
		such as simply having the additional columns on the left and the content area on the right,
		difficult to achieve.
		This has been addressed in many ways over the years,
		often going by the name "Holy Grail Layout" when there are two additional columns.
		'order' makes this trivial.
		For example, take the following sketch of a page's code and desired layout:

		<div class='code-and-figure'>
			<div>
				<pre class="lang-markup">
					&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
					&lt;header>...&lt;/header>
					&lt;main>
					   &lt;article>...&lt;/article>
					   &lt;nav>...&lt;/nav>
					   &lt;aside>...&lt;/aside>
					&lt;/main>
					&lt;footer>...&lt;/footer>
				</pre>
			</div>
			<div><img src="images/flex-order-page.svg" width=400 height=360 alt="In this page the header is at the top and the footer at the bottom, but the article is in the center, flanked by the nav on the right and the aside on the left."></div>
		</div>

		This layout can be easily achieved with flex layout:

		<pre class="lang-css">
			main { display: flex; }
			main > article { order: 2; min-width: 12em; flex:1; }
			main > nav     { order: 1; width: 200px; }
			main > aside   { order: 3; width: 200px; }
		</pre>

		As an added bonus,
		the columns will all be <a value for="align-self" lt="stretch">equal-height</a> by default,
		and the main content will be as wide as necessary to fill the screen.
		Additionally,
		this can then be combined with media queries to switch to an all-vertical layout on narrow screens:

		<pre class="lang-css">
			@media all and (max-width: 600px) {
				/* Too narrow to support three columns */
				main { flex-flow: column; }
				main > article, main > nav, main > aside {
					/* Return them to document order */
					order: 0; width: auto;
				}
			}
		</pre>

		<small>(Further use of multi-line flex containers to achieve even more intelligent wrapping left as an exercise for the reader.)</small>
	</div>

	In order to preserve the author's intended ordering in all presentation modes,
	authoring tools&mdash;including WYSIWYG editors as well as Web-based authoring aids--
	must reorder the underlying document source
	and not use 'order' to perform reordering
	unless the author has explicitly indicated that the underlying
	document order (which determines speech and navigation order) should be
	<em>out-of-sync</em> with the visual order.

	<div class="example">
		For example, a tool might offer both drag-and-drop reordering of flex items
		as well as handling of media queries for alternate layouts per screen size range.

		Since most of the time, reordering should affect all screen ranges
		as well as navigation and speech order,
		the tool would perform drag-and-drop reordering at the DOM layer.
		In some cases, however, the author may want different visual orderings per screen size.
		The tool could offer this functionality by using 'order' together with media queries,
		but also tie the smallest screen size's ordering to the underlying DOM order
		(since this is most likely to be a logical linear presentation order)
		while using 'order' to determine the visual presentation order in other size ranges.

		This tool would be conformant, whereas a tool that only ever used 'order'
		to handle drag-and-drop reordering
		(however convenient it might be to implement it that way)
		would be non-conformant.
	</div>

	Note: User agents, including browsers, accessible technology, and extensions,
	may offer spatial navigation features.
	This section does not preclude respecting the 'order' property
	when determining element ordering in such spatial navigation modes;
	indeed it would need to be considered for such a feature to work.
	But 'order' is not the only (or even the primary) CSS property
	that would need to be considered for such a spatial navigation feature.
	A well-implemented spatial navigation feature would need to consider
	all the layout features of CSS that modify spatial relationships.

<h2 id='flex-lines'>
Flex Lines</h2>

	<a>Flex items</a> in a <a>flex container</a> are laid out and aligned
	within <dfn export lt="flex line">flex lines</dfn>,
	hypothetical containers used for grouping and alignment by the layout algorithm.
	A flex container can be either <a>single-line</a> or <a>multi-line</a>,
	depending on the 'flex-wrap' property:

	* A <dfn export local-lt="single-line">single-line flex container</dfn>
		(i.e. one with ''flex-wrap: nowrap'')
		lays out all of its children in a single line,
		even if that would cause its contents to overflow.
	* A <dfn export local-lt="multi-line">multi-line flex container</dfn>
		(i.e. one with ''flex-wrap: wrap'' or ''flex-wrap: wrap-reverse'')
		breaks its <a>flex items</a> across multiple lines,
		similar to how text is broken onto a new line when it gets too wide to fit on the existing line.
		When additional lines are created,
		they are stacked in the flex container along the <a>cross axis</a>
		according to the 'flex-wrap' property.
		Every line contains at least one <a>flex item</a>,
		unless the flex container itself is completely empty.

	<div class=example>
		This example shows four buttons that do not fit side-by-side horizontally,
		and therefore will wrap into multiple lines.

		<pre class="lang-css">
			#flex {
				display: flex;
				flex-flow: row wrap;
				width: 300px;
			}
			.item {
				width: 80px;
			}
		</pre>
		<pre class="lang-markup">
			&lt;div id="flex">
				&lt;div class="item">1&lt;/div>
				&lt;div class="item">2&lt;/div>
				&lt;div class="item">3&lt;/div>
				&lt;div class="item">4&lt;/div>
			&lt;/div>
		</pre>

		Since the container is 300px wide, only three of the items fit onto a single line.
		They take up 240px, with 60px left over of remaining space.
		Because the 'flex-flow' property specifies a <a>multi-line</a> flex container
		(due to the ''wrap'' keyword appearing in its value),
		the flex container will create an additional line to contain the last item.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/multiline-no-flex.svg">
			<figcaption>An example rendering of the multi-line flex container.</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>

	Once content is broken into lines,
	each line is laid out independently;
	flexible lengths and the 'justify-content' and 'align-self' properties only consider the items on a single line at a time.

	In a <a>multi-line</a> <a>flex container</a> (even one with only a single line),
	the <a>cross size</a> of each line
	is the minimum size necessary to contain the <a>flex items</a> on the line
	(after alignment due to 'align-self'),
	and the lines are aligned within the flex container with the 'align-content' property.
	In a <a>single-line</a> <a>flex container</a>,
	the <a>cross size</a> of the line is the <a>cross size</a> of the flex container,
	and 'align-content' has no effect.
	The <a>main size</a> of a line is always the same as the <a>main size</a> of the flex container's content box.

		align-content-004.htm
		align-content-005.htm
		align-content-006.htm
	</wpt>

	<div class='example'>
		Here's the same example as the previous,
		except that the flex items have all been given ''flex: auto''.
		The first line has 60px of remaining space,
		and all of the items have the same flexibility,
		so each of the three items on that line will receive 20px of extra width,
		each ending up 100px wide.
		The remaining item is on a line of its own
		and will stretch to the entire width of the line, i.e. 300px.

Flexibility</h2>

	The defining aspect of flex layout is the ability to make the <a>flex items</a> “flex”,
	altering their width/height to fill the available space in the <a>main dimension</a>.
	This is done with the 'flex' property.
	A flex container distributes free space to its items (proportional to their <a>flex grow factor</a>) to fill the container,
	or shrinks them (proportional to their <a>flex shrink factor</a>) to prevent overflow.

	A <a>flex item</a> is <dfn>fully inflexible</dfn>
	if both its 'flex-grow' and 'flex-shrink' values are zero,
	and <dfn>flexible</dfn> otherwise.

<h3 id='flex-property'>
The 'flex' Shorthand</h3>

	<pre class='propdef shorthand'>
	Name: flex
	Value: none | [ <<'flex-grow'>> <<'flex-shrink'>>? || <<'flex-basis'>> ]
	Initial: 0 1 auto
	Applies to: <a>flex items</a>
	Inherited: no
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	The 'flex' property specifies the components of a flexible size:
	the <dfn lt="flex factor">flex factors</dfn>
	(<a lt="flex grow factor">grow</a> and <a lt="flex shrink factor">shrink</a>)
	and the <a>flex basis</a>.
	When a box is a <a>flex item</a>,
	'flex' is consulted <em>instead of</em> the <a>main size property</a>
	to determine the <a>main size</a> of the box.
	If a box is not a <a>flex item</a>,
	'flex' has no effect.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=flex>
		<dt><dfn><<'flex-grow'>></dfn>
		<dd>
			This <<number [0,&infin;]>> component sets 'flex-grow' <a href="#flex-components">longhand</a>
			and specifies the <dfn dfn>flex grow factor</dfn>,
			which determines how much the <a>flex item</a> will grow
			relative to the rest of the <a>flex items</a> in the flex container
			when positive free space is distributed.
			When omitted, it is set to ''1''.

			<details class=note>
				<summary>Flex values between 0 and 1 have a somewhat special behavior:
				when the sum of the flex values on the line is less than 1,
				they will take up less than 100% of the free space.</summary>

				An item’s 'flex-grow' value
				is effectively a request for some proportion of the free space,
				with ''1'' meaning “100% of the free space”;
				then if the items on the line are requesting more than 100% in total,
				the requests are rebalanced to keep the same ratio but use up exactly 100% of it.
				However, if the items request <em>less</em> than the full amount
				(such as three items that are each ''flex-grow: .25'')
				then they'll each get exactly what they request
				(25% of the free space to each,
				with the final 25% left unfilled).
				See [[#resolve-flexible-lengths]] for the exact details
				of how free space is distributed.

				This pattern is required for continuous behavior as 'flex-grow' approaches zero
				(which means the item wants <em>none</em> of the free space).
				Without this, a ''flex-grow: 1'' item would take all of the free space;
				but so would a ''flex-grow: 0.1'' item,
				and a ''flex-grow: 0.01'' item,
				etc.,
				until finally the value is small enough to underflow to zero
				and the item suddenly takes up none of the free space.
				With this behavior,
				the item instead gradually takes less of the free space
				as 'flex-grow' shrinks below ''1'',
				smoothly transitioning to taking none of the free space at zero.

				Unless this “partial fill” behavior is <em>specifically</em> what's desired,
				authors should stick to values &ge; 1;
				for example, using ''1'' and ''2'' is usually better
				than using ''.33'' and ''.67'',
				as they're more likely to behave as intended
				if items are added, removed, or line-wrapped.

		<dt><dfn><<'flex-shrink'>></dfn>
		<dd>
			This <<number [0,&infin;]>> component sets 'flex-shrink' <a href="#flex-components">longhand</a>
			and specifies the <dfn dfn>flex shrink factor</dfn>,
			which determines how much the <a>flex item</a> will shrink
			relative to the rest of the <a>flex items</a> in the flex container
			when negative free space is distributed.
			When omitted, it is set to ''1''.

			<wpt>
				flex-002.htm
				flex-004.htm
			</wpt>

			Note: The <a>flex shrink factor</a> is multiplied by the <a>flex base size</a> when distributing negative space.
			This distributes negative space in proportion to how much the item is able to shrink,
			so that e.g. a small item won't shrink to zero before a larger item has been noticeably reduced.

		<dt><dfn><<'flex-basis'>></dfn>
		<dd>
			This component sets the 'flex-basis' <a href="#flex-components">longhand</a>,
			which specifies the <dfn dfn>flex basis</dfn>:
			the initial <a>main size</a> of the <a>flex item</a>,
			before free space is distributed according to the flex factors.

			<<'flex-basis'>> accepts the same values as the 'width' and 'height' properties
			(except that ''flex-basis/auto'' is treated differently)
			plus the ''content'' keyword:

			<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=flex-basis>
				<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
				<dd>
					When specified on a <a>flex item</a>, the ''flex-basis/auto'' keyword
					retrieves the value of the <a>main size property</a> as the used 'flex-basis'.
					If that value is itself ''auto'', then the used value is ''flex-basis/content''.

				<dt><dfn>content</dfn>
				<dd>
					Indicates an [=automatic size=]
					based on the <a>flex item</a>’s content.
					(This is typically equivalent to the <a>max-content size</a>,
					but with adjustments to handle [=preferred aspect ratios=],
					intrinsic sizing constraints,
					and orthogonal flows;
					see <a href="#algo-main-item">details</a> in [[#layout-algorithm]].)

					Note: This value was not present in the initial release of Flexible Box Layout,
					and thus some older implementations will not support it.
					The equivalent effect can be achieved by using ''flex/auto''
					together with a main size ('width' or 'height') of ''width/auto''.

				<dt><<'width'>>
				<dd>
					For all other values,
					'flex-basis' is resolved the same way as for 'width' and 'height'.
			</dl>

			When omitted from the 'flex' shorthand, its specified value is ''0''.

		<dt><dfn>none</dfn>
		<dd>
			The keyword ''flex/none'' expands to ''0 0 auto''.

	The initial values of the 'flex' components are equivalent to <a class="css-code" href="#flex-initial">flex: 0 1 auto</a>.

	Note: The initial values of 'flex-grow' and 'flex-basis'
	are different from their defaults when omitted in the 'flex' shorthand.
	This is so that the 'flex' shorthand can better accommodate the most <a href="#flex-common">common cases</a>.

	A unitless zero that is not already preceded by two flex factors
	must be interpreted as a flex factor.
	To avoid misinterpretation or invalid declarations,
	authors must specify a zero <<'flex-basis'>> component
	with a unit or precede it by two flex factors.

<h4 id='flex-common'>
Basic Values of 'flex'</h4>

	<em>This section is informative.</em>

	The list below summarizes the effects of the four 'flex' values
	that represent most commonly-desired effects:

	<dl>
		<dt id="flex-initial">''flex: initial''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: 0 1 auto''. (This is the initial value.)
			Sizes the item based on the 'width'/'height' properties.
			(If the item's <a>main size property</a> computes to <a value for=width>auto</a>,
			this will size the flex item based on its contents.)
			Makes the flex item inflexible when there is positive free space,
			but allows it to shrink to its minimum size when there is insufficient space.
			The <a href="#alignment">alignment abilities</a> or <a href="#auto-margins"><span class=css>auto</span> margins</a>
			can be used to align flex items along the <a>main axis</a>.

		<dt>''flex: auto''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: 1 1 auto''.
			Sizes the item based on the 'width'/'height' properties,
			but makes them fully flexible, so that they absorb any free space along the <a>main axis</a>.
			If all items are either ''flex: auto'', ''flex: initial'', or ''flex: none'',
			any positive free space after the items have been sized will be distributed evenly to the items with ''flex: auto''.

		<dt>''flex: none''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: 0 0 auto''.
			This value sizes the item according to the 'width'/'height' properties,
			but makes the flex item <a>fully inflexible</a>.
			This is similar to ''initial'',
			except that flex items are not allowed to shrink,
			even in overflow situations.

		<dt>''flex: <<number [1,&infin;]>>''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: <<number [1,&infin;]>> 1 0''.
			Makes the flex item flexible and sets the <a>flex basis</a> to zero,
			resulting in an item that receives the specified proportion of the free space in the flex container.
			If all items in the flex container use this pattern,
			their sizes will be proportional to the specified flex factor.
	</dl>

	By default, flex items won't shrink below their minimum content size
	(the length of the longest word or fixed-size element).
	To change this, set the 'min-width' or 'min-height' property.
	(See [[#min-size-auto]].)

<h3 id='flex-components'>
Components of Flexibility</h3>

	Individual components of flexibility can be controlled by independent longhand properties.

	Advisement: Authors are encouraged to control flexibility using the 'flex' shorthand
	rather than with its longhand properties directly,
	as the shorthand correctly resets any unspecified components
	to accommodate <a href="#flex-common">common uses</a>.

<h4 id='flex-grow-property'>
The 'flex-grow' property</h4>

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: flex-grow
	Value: <<number [0,&infin;]>>
	Initial: 0
	Applies to: <a>flex items</a>
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: specified number
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	Advisement: Authors are encouraged to control flexibility using the 'flex' shorthand

	The 'flex-grow' property sets the <a>flex grow factor</a>
	to the provided <dfn value for=flex-grow><<number>></dfn>.
	Negative values are not allowed.

<h4 id='flex-shrink-property'>
The 'flex-shrink' property</h4>

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: flex-shrink
	Value: <<number [0,&infin;]>>
	Initial: 1
	Applies to: <a>flex items</a>
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: specified value
	Animation type: number
	</pre>

	Advisement: Authors are encouraged to control flexibility using the 'flex' shorthand
	rather than with 'flex-shrink' directly,
	as the shorthand correctly resets any unspecified components
	to accommodate <a href="#flex-common">common uses</a>.

	The 'flex-shrink' property sets the <a>flex shrink factor</a>
	to the provided <dfn value for=flex-shrink><<number>></dfn>.
	Negative values are not allowed.

<h4 id='flex-basis-property'>
The 'flex-basis' property</h4>

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: flex-basis
	Value: content | <<'width'>>
	Initial: auto
	Applies to: <a>flex items</a>
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: relative to the <a>flex container's</a> inner <a>main size</a>
	Computed value: specified keyword or a computed <<length-percentage>> value
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	Advisement: Authors are encouraged to control flexibility using the 'flex' shorthand
	rather than with 'flex-basis' directly,
	as the shorthand correctly resets any unspecified components
	to accommodate <a href="#flex-common">common uses</a>.

	The 'flex-basis' property sets the <a>flex basis</a>.
	It accepts the same values as the 'width' and 'height' property, plus ''content''.

	For all values other than ''flex-basis/auto'' and ''content'' (defined above),
	'flex-basis' is resolved the same way as 'width' in horizontal writing modes [[!CSS2]],
	except that if a value would resolve to ''width/auto'' for 'width',
	it instead resolves to ''content'' for 'flex-basis'.
	For example, percentage values of 'flex-basis' are resolved against
	the flex item's containing block (i.e. its <a>flex container</a>);
	and if that containing block's size is <a>indefinite</a>,
	the used value for 'flex-basis' is ''content''.
	As another corollary,
	'flex-basis' determines the size of the content box,
	unless otherwise specified
	such as by 'box-sizing' [[CSS3UI]].

<h2 id='alignment'>
Alignment</h2>

	After a flex container's contents have finished their flexing
	and the dimensions of all flex items are finalized,
	they can then be aligned within the flex container.

	The 'margin' properties can be used to align items in a manner similar to, but more powerful than, what margins can do in block layout.
	<a>Flex items</a> also respect the alignment properties from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-align/">CSS Box Alignment</a>,
	which allow easy keyword-based alignment of items in both the <a>main axis</a> and <a>cross axis</a>.
	These properties make many common types of alignment trivial,
	including some things that were very difficult in CSS 2.1,
	like horizontal and vertical centering.

	Note: While the alignment properties are defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-align/">CSS Box Alignment</a> [[!CSS-ALIGN-3]],
	Flexible Box Layout reproduces the definitions of the relevant ones here
	so as to not create a normative dependency that may slow down advancement of the spec.
	These properties apply only to flex layout
	until <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-align/">CSS Box Alignment Level 3</a> is finished
	and defines their effect for other layout modes.
	Additionally, any new values defined in the Box Alignment module
	will apply to Flexible Box Layout;
	in other words, the Box Alignment module, once completed,
	will supersede the definitions here.

<h3 id='auto-margins'>
Aligning with <a value for=margin>auto</a> margins</h3>

	<em>This section is non-normative.
		The normative definition of how margins affect flex items is in the <a href="#layout-algorithm">Flex Layout Algorithm</a> section.</em>

	Auto margins on flex items have an effect very similar to auto margins in block flow:

	* During calculations of flex bases and flexible lengths, auto margins are treated as ''0''.
	* Prior to alignment via 'justify-content' and 'align-self',
		any positive free space is distributed to auto margins in that dimension.
	* Overflowing boxes ignore their auto margins and overflow in the <a>end</a> direction.

	<wpt>
		auto-margins-001.html
	</wpt>

	Note: If free space is distributed to auto margins,
	the alignment properties will have no effect in that dimension
	because the margins will have stolen all the free space
	left over after flexing.

	<div class='example'>
		One use of ''margin/auto'' margins in the main axis is to separate flex items into distinct "groups".
		The following example shows how to use this to reproduce a common UI pattern -
		a single bar of actions with some aligned on the left and others aligned on the right.

		<figure>

				<li id='login'><a href=#>Login</a>
			</ul>
		</figure>

		<pre class="lang-css">

				display: flex;

			<figcaption>
				The items in the figure on the left are centered with margins,
				while those in the figure on the right are centered with 'align-self'.

	<a>Flex items</a> can be aligned in the <a>cross axis</a> of the current line of the flex container,
	similar to 'justify-content' but in the perpendicular direction.
	'align-items' sets the default alignment for all of the flex container's <a lt="flex items">items</a>,
	including anonymous <a>flex items</a>.
	'align-self' allows this default alignment to be overridden for individual <a>flex items</a>.
	(For anonymous flex items,
	'align-self' always matches the value of 'align-items' on their associated flex container.)

	If either of the <a>flex item's</a> cross-axis margins are <a value for=margin>auto</a>,
	'align-self' has no effect.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="align-items, align-self">

	The 'align-content' property aligns a flex container's lines within the flex container
	when there is extra space in the <a>cross-axis</a>,
	similar to how 'justify-content' aligns individual items within the <a>main-axis</a>.
	Note, this property has no effect on a <a>single-line</a> <a>flex container</a>.
	Values have the following meanings:

Flex Container Baselines</h3>

	In order for a <a>flex container</a> to itself <a href="#baseline-participation">participate in baseline alignment</a>
	(e.g. when the <a>flex container</a> is itself a <a>flex item</a> in an outer <a>flex container</a>),
	it needs to submit the position of the baselines that will best represent its contents.
	To this end,
	the baselines of a flex container are determined as follows
	(after reordering with 'order',
	and taking 'flex-direction' into account):

	<dl>
		<dt>first/last <dfn export id="main-axis-baseline"
		    lt="main-axis baseline set|first main-axis baseline set|last main-axis baseline set">
		    main-axis baseline set</dfn>
		<dd>
			When the <a>inline axis</a> of the <a>flex container</a>
			matches its <a>main axis</a>,
			its baselines are determined as follows:

			1. If any of the <a>flex items</a> on the flex container's startmost/endmost <a>flex line</a>
				<a href="#baseline-participation">participate in baseline alignment</a>,
				the flex container's first/last <a>main-axis baseline set</a>
				is <a lt="generate baselines">generated</a> from
				the shared <a>alignment baseline</a> of those <a>flex items</a>.

			2. Otherwise, if the flex container has at least one <a>flex item</a>,
				the flex container's first/last <a>main-axis baseline set</a>
				is <a lt="generate baselines">generated</a> from
				the <a>alignment baseline</a> of the startmost/endmost <a>flex item</a>.
				(If that item has no <a>alignment baseline</a>
				parallel to the flex container's <a>main axis</a>,
				then one is first <a lt="synthesized baseline">synthesized</a>
				from its border edges.)

			3. Otherwise, the flex container has no first/last main-axis <a>baseline set</a>,
				and one is <a lt="synthesize baselines">synthesized</a> if needed
				according to the rules of its <a>alignment context</a>.

		<dt>first/last <dfn export id="cross-axis-baseline"
			lt="cross-axis baseline set|first cross-axis baseline set|last cross-axis baseline set">
			cross-axis baseline set</dfn>
		<dd>
			When the <a>inline axis</a> of the <a>flex container</a>
			matches its <a>cross axis</a>,
			its baselines are determined as follows:

			1. If the flex container has at least one <a>flex item</a>,
				the flex container's first/last <a>cross-axis baseline set</a>
				is <a lt="generate baselines">generated</a> from

				and one is <a lt="synthesize baselines">synthesized</a> if needed
				according to the rules of its <a>alignment context</a>.

	</dl>

	When calculating the baseline according to the above rules,
	if the box contributing a baseline has an 'overflow' value that allows scrolling,
	the box must be treated as being in its initial scroll position
	for the purpose of determining its baseline.

	When <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#height-layout">determining the baseline of a table cell</a>,
	a flex container provides a baseline just as a line box or table-row does. [[!CSS2]]

	and [[css-align-3#baseline-rules]]

<h2 id='layout-algorithm'>
Flex Layout Algorithm</h2>

	This section contains normative algorithms
	detailing the exact layout behavior of a flex container and its contents.
	The algorithms here are written to optimize readability and theoretical simplicity,
	and may not necessarily be the most efficient.
	Implementations may use whatever actual algorithms they wish,
	but must produce the same results as the algorithms described here.

	Note: This section is mainly intended for implementors.
	Authors writing web pages should generally be served well by the individual property descriptions,
	and do not need to read this section unless they have a deep-seated urge to understand arcane details of CSS layout.

	The following sections define the algorithm for laying out a flex container and its contents.

	Note: Flex layout works with the <a>flex items</a> in <a>order-modified document order</a>,
	not their original document order.

<h3 id='box-manip'>
Initial Setup</h3>

	<ol start=1 class="layout-start">
		<li id='algo-anon-box'>
			<strong>Generate anonymous flex items</strong>
			as described in [[#flex-items]].
	</ol>

<h3 id='line-sizing'>
Line Length Determination</h3>

	<ol class=continue>
		<li id='algo-available'>
			<strong>Determine the available main and cross space for the flex items.</strong>
			For each dimension,
			if that dimension of the <a>flex container</a>’s content box is a <a>definite size</a>, use that;
			if that dimension of the <a>flex container</a> is being sized under a <a lt="min-content constraint">min</a> or <a>max-content constraint</a>,
			the available space in that dimension is that constraint;
			otherwise, subtract the <a>flex container</a>’s margin, border, and padding
			from the space available to the flex container in that dimension
			and use that value.
			<span class='note'>This might result in an infinite value.</span>
			<!-- Maybe???
			For this purpose,
			the block axis of a block container(?)
			always provides infinite available space.
			-->

			<div class='example'>
				<p>For example, the <a>available space</a> to a flex item in a
					<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#floats">floated</a> <a value for=width>auto</a>-sized <a>flex container</a> is:
				<ul>
					<li>the width of the <a>flex container</a>’s containing block minus the <a>flex container</a>’s margin, border, and padding in the horizontal dimension
					<li>infinite in the vertical dimension
				</ul>

		<li id='algo-main-item'>
			<strong>Determine the <dfn>flex base size</dfn> and <dfn>hypothetical main size</dfn> of each item:</strong>

			<ol type=A>
				<li>
					If the item has a <a>definite</a> used <a>flex basis</a>,
					that's the <a>flex base size</a>.

				<li>
					If the flex item has ...

						<li>a [=preferred aspect ratio=],
						<li>a used <a>flex basis</a> of ''content'', and
						<li>a <a>definite</a> <a>cross size</a>,
					</ul>
					then the <a>flex base size</a> is calculated from
					its <a lt="used value">used</a> <a>cross size</a>
					and the <a>flex item</a>’s aspect ratio.

				<li>
					If the used <a>flex basis</a> is ''content'' or depends on its <a>available space</a>,

					(e.g. when performing <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#auto-table-layout">automatic table layout</a> [[!CSS2]]),
					size the item under that constraint.
					The <a>flex base size</a> is the item's resulting <a>main size</a>.

				<li>
					Otherwise,
					if the used <a>flex basis</a> is ''content'' or depends on its <a>available space</a>,
					the available main size is infinite,

					<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#orthogonal-flows">the rules for a box in an orthogonal flow</a> [[!CSS3-WRITING-MODES]].
					The <a>flex base size</a> is the item's max-content <a>main size</a>.

					Note: This case occurs, for example,
					in an English document (horizontal <a>writing mode</a>)
					containing a column flex container
					containing a vertical Japanese (vertical <a>writing mode</a>) <a>flex item</a>.

				<li>
					Otherwise,
					size the item into the <a>available space</a>
					using its used <a>flex basis</a> in place of its <a>main size</a>,
					treating a value of ''content'' as ''width/max-content''.
					If a <a>cross size</a> is needed to determine the <a>main size</a>
					(e.g. when the <a>flex item</a>’s <a>main size</a> is in its block axis)
					and the <a>flex item</a>’s cross size is ''auto'' and not <a>definite</a>,
					in this calculation use ''width/fit-content'' as the <a>flex item</a>’s <a>cross size</a>.
					The <a>flex base size</a> is the item's resulting <a>main size</a>.

					<wpt>
						css-flexbox-img-expand-evenly.html
					</wpt>
			</ol>

			When determining the <a>flex base size</a>,
			the item’s min and max <a>main sizes</a> are ignored
			(no clamping occurs).
			Furthermore, the sizing calculations that floor the content box size at zero
			when applying 'box-sizing' are also ignored.
			(For example, an item with a specified size of zero,
			positive padding, and ''box-sizing: border-box''
			will have an outer <a>flex base size</a> of zero--
			and hence a negative inner <a>flex base size</a>.)

			The <a>hypothetical main size</a> is the item's <a>flex base size</a>

			(and flooring the content box size at zero).

	Although CSS Sizing [[!CSS-SIZING-3]] defines <a spec=css-sizing>definite</a> and <a spec=css-sizing>indefinite</a> lengths,

Intrinsic Sizes</h3>

	The <a>intrinsic sizing</a> of a <a>flex container</a> is used
	to produce various types of content-based automatic sizing,
	such as shrink-to-fit logical widths (which use the ''fit-content'' formula)
	and content-based logical heights (which use the <a>max-content size</a>).
	For these computations, <a value for=margin>auto</a> margins on flex items are treated as ''0''.

	See [[!CSS-SIZING-3]] for a definition of the terms in this section.

<h4 id='intrinsic-main-sizes'>
Flex Container Intrinsic Main Sizes</h4>

	The <strong><a>max-content</a> <a>main size</a> of a <a>flex container</a></strong>
	is the smallest size the <a>flex container</a> can take
	while maintaining the [[#intrinsic-item-contributions|max-content contributions]] of its <a>flex items</a>,
	insofar as allowed by the items’ own flexibility:

	<ol>
		<li>
			For each <a>flex item</a>,
			subtract its outer <a>flex base size</a> from its [[#intrinsic-item-contributions|max-content contribution]] size.
			If that result is positive,
			divide by its <a>flex grow factor</a> floored at 1;
			if negative,
			divide by its <a>scaled flex shrink factor</a>
			having floored the <a>flex shrink factor</a> at 1.
			This is the item's <var>max-content flex fraction</var>.

		<li>
			Place all <a>flex items</a> into lines of infinite length.

		<li>
			Within each line,
			find the largest <var>max-content flex fraction</var>
			among all the <a>flex items</a>.
			Add each item’s <a>flex base size</a>
			to the product of its <a>flex grow factor</a>
			(or <a>scaled flex shrink factor</a>, if the chosen <var>max-content flex fraction</var> was negative)
			and the chosen <var>max-content flex fraction</var>,
			then clamp that result by the <a>max main size</a>
			floored by the <a>min main size</a>.

		<li>
			The <a>flex container</a>’s <a>max-content size</a> is the
			largest sum of the afore-calculated sizes of all items within a single line.
	</ol>

	The <strong><a>min-content</a> <a>main size</a></strong> of a <em><a>single-line</a></em> flex container
	is calculated identically to the <a>max-content</a> <a>main size</a>,
	except that the <a>flex item’s</a> [[#intrinsic-item-contributions|min-content contribution]] is used
	instead of its [[#intrinsic-item-contributions|max-content contribution]].
	However, for a <em><a>multi-line</a></em> container,
	it is simply the largest [[#intrinsic-item-contributions|min-content contribution]]
	of all the <a>flex items</a> in the <a>flex container</a>.

	<details class=note>
		<summary>Implications of this algorithm when the sum of flex is less than 1</summary>

		The above algorithm is designed to give the correct behavior for two cases in particular,
		and make the <a>flex container’s</a> size continuous as you transition between the two:

		1. If all items are inflexible,
			the <a>flex container</a> is sized to the sum of their <a>flex base size</a>.
			(An inflexible <a>flex base size</a> basically substitutes for a 'width'/'height',
			which, when specified, is what a <a>max-content contribution</a> is based on in Block Layout.)

		2. When all items are flexible with <a>flex factors</a> ≥ 1,
			the <a>flex container</a> is sized to the sum of the <a>max-content contributions</a> of its items
			(or perhaps a slightly larger size,
			so that every flex item is <em>at least</em> the size of its <a>max-content contribution</a>,
			but also has the correct ratio of its size to the size of the other items,
			as determined by its flexibility).

		For example, if a <a>flex container</a> has a single <a>flex item</a>
		with ''flex-basis: 100px;'' but a max-content size of ''200px'',
		then when the item is ''flex-grow: 0'', the <a>flex container</a> (and <a>flex item</a>) is ''100px'' wide,
		but when the item is ''flex-grow: 1'' or higher, the <a>flex container</a> (and flex item) is ''200px'' wide.

		There are several possible ways to make the overall behavior continuous between these two cases,
		particularly when the sum of flexibilities on a line is between 0 and 1,
		but all of them have drawbacks.
		We chose one we feel has the least bad implications;
		unfortunately, it "double-applies" the flexibility when the sum of the flexibilities is less than 1.
		In the above example, if the item has ''flex-grow: .5'',
		then the <a>flex container</a> ends up ''150px'' wide,
		but the item then sizes normally into that available space,
		ending up ''125px'' wide.
	</details>

<h4 id='intrinsic-cross-sizes'>
Flex Container Intrinsic Cross Sizes</h4>

	The <strong><a>min-content</a>/<a>max-content</a> <a>cross size</a></strong> of a <em><a>single-line</a></em> <a>flex container</a>
	is the largest <a>min-content contribution</a>/<a>max-content contribution</a> (respectively)
	of its <a>flex items</a>.

	For a <em><a>multi-line</a></em> <a>flex container</a>,
	the <a>min-content</a>/<a>max-content</a> <a>cross size</a>
	is the sum of the flex line cross sizes
	resulting from sizing the flex container under a <a>cross-axis</a> <a>min-content constraint</a>/<a>max-content constraint</a> (respectively).
	However, if the <a>flex container</a> is ''flex-flow: column wrap;'',
	then it's sized by first finding the largest
	<a lt="min-content contribution">min-content</a>/<a lt="min-content contribution">max-content</a>
	<a>cross-size</a> contribution among the <a>flex items</a> (respectively),
	then using that size as the <a>available space</a> in the <a>cross axis</a>
	for each of the <a>flex items</a> during layout.

	Note: This heuristic for ''column wrap'' <a>flex containers</a>
	gives a reasonable approximation of the size that the <a>flex container</a> should be,
	with each flex item ending up as min(<var>item’s own max-content</var>, <var>maximum min-content among all items</var>),
	and each <a>flex line</a> no larger than its largest <a>flex item</a>.
	It's not a <em>perfect</em> fit in some cases,
	but doing it completely correct is insanely expensive,
	and this works reasonably well.

<h4 id='intrinsic-item-contributions'>
Flex Item Intrinsic Size Contributions</h4>

	The <strong>main-size <a>min-content contribution</a> of a <a>flex item</a></strong>
	is the larger of its <em>outer</em> <a>min-content size</a>

	if that is not ''width/auto'',
	clamped by its <a>flex base size</a> as a maximum (if it is not growable)

<h2 id="pagination">
Fragmenting Flex Layout</h2>

	<p>
		Flex containers can break across pages
		between items,
		between lines of items (in <a>multi-line</a> mode),
		and inside items.
		The <a property lt="break-before">break-*</a> properties apply to flex containers as normal for block-level or inline-level boxes.
		This section defines how they apply to flex items
		and the contents of flex items.
		See the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-break/">CSS Fragmentation Module</a>
		for more context [[!CSS3-BREAK]].

	<p>
		The following breaking rules refer to the <a>fragmentation container</a> as the “page”.
		The same rules apply in any other <a>fragmentation context</a>.
		(Substitute “page” with the appropriate <a>fragmentation container</a> type as needed.)
		For readability, in this section the terms "row" and "column" refer to the relative orientation
		of the <a>flex container</a> with respect to the block flow direction of the <a>fragmentation context</a>,
		rather than to that of the <a>flex container</a> itself.

	<p>
		The exact layout of a fragmented flex container
		is not defined in this level of Flexible Box Layout.
		However, breaks inside a flex container are subject to the following rules
		(interpreted using <a>order-modified document order</a>):

	<ul>
		<li>
			In a row flex container,
			the 'break-before' and 'break-after' values on flex items
			are propagated to the flex line.
			The 'break-before' values on the first line
			and the 'break-after' values on the last line
			are propagated to the flex container.

			Note: Break propagation
			(like 'text-decoration' propagation)
			does not affect <a>computed values</a>.

		<li>
			In a column flex container,
			the 'break-before' values on the first item
			and the 'break-after' values on the last item
			are propagated to the flex container.
			Forced breaks on other items are applied to the item itself.

		<li>
			A forced break inside a flex item effectively increases the size of its contents;
			it does not trigger a forced break inside sibling items.

		<li>
			In a row flex container,
			<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#btw-blocks">Class A break opportunities</a> occur between sibling flex lines,
			and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#end-block">Class C break opportunities</a> occur between the first/last flex line and the flex container's content edges.
			In a column flex container,
			<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#btw-blocks">Class A break opportunities</a> occur between sibling flex items,
			and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#end-block">Class C break opportunities</a> occur between the first/last flex items on a line and the flex container's content edges.
			[[!CSS3-BREAK]]

		<li>
			When a flex container is continued after a break,
			the space available to its <a>flex items</a>
			(in the block flow direction of the fragmentation context)
			is reduced by the space consumed by flex container fragments on previous pages.
			The space consumed by a flex container fragment is
			the size of its content box on that page.
			If as a result of this adjustment the available space becomes negative,
			it is set to zero.

		<li>
			If the first fragment of the flex container is not at the top of the page,
			and none of its flex items fit in the remaining space on the page,
			the entire fragment is moved to the next page.

		<li>
			When a <a>multi-line</a> column flex container breaks,
			each fragment has its own "stack" of flex lines,
			just like each fragment of a multi-column container
			has its own row of column boxes.

		<li>
			Aside from the rearrangement of items imposed by the previous point,
			UAs should attempt to minimize distortion of the flex container
			with respect to unfragmented flow.
	</ul>

<div class='example'>

	<p class='note'>
		This algorithm assumes that pagination always proceeds only in the forward direction;
		therefore, in the algorithms below, alignment is mostly ignored prior to pagination.
		Advanced layout engines may be able to honor alignment across fragments.

	<dl>
		<dt><a>single-line</a> column flex container
		<dd>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Run the flex layout algorithm (without regards to pagination)
					through <a href="#cross-sizing">Cross Sizing Determination</a>.

				<li>
					Lay out as many consecutive flex items or item fragments as possible
					(but at least one or a fragment thereof),
					starting from the first,
					until there is no more room on the page
					or a forced break is encountered.

				<li>
					If the previous step ran out of room
					and the free space is positive,
					the UA may reduce the distributed free space on this page
					(down to, but not past, zero)
					in order to make room for the next unbreakable flex item or fragment.
					Otherwise,
					the item or fragment that does not fit is pushed to the next page.
					The UA should pull up if more than 50% of the fragment would have fit in the remaining space
					and should push otherwise.

				<li>
					If there are any flex items or fragments not laid out by the previous steps,
					rerun the flex layout algorithm
					from <a href="#line-sizing">Line Length Determination</a>
					through <a href="#cross-sizing">Cross Sizing Determination</a>
					with the next page's size
					and <em>all</em> the contents (including those already laid out),
					and return to the previous step,
					but starting from the first item or fragment not already laid out.

				<li>
					For each fragment of the flex container,
					continue the flex layout algorithm
					from <a href="#main-alignment">Main-Axis Alignment</a>
					to its finish.
			</ol>

			<p class="note">
				It is the intent of this algorithm that column-direction <a>single-line</a> flex containers
				paginate very similarly to block flow.
				As a test of the intent,
				a flex container with ''justify-content:start''
				and no flexible items
				should paginate identically to
				a block with in-flow children with same content,
				same used size and same used margins.

		<dt><a>multi-line</a> column flex container

			<ol>
				<li>
					Run the flex layout algorithm
					<em>with</em> regards to pagination
					(limiting the flex container's maximum line length to the space left on the page)

				<li>
					Lay out as many flex lines as possible
					(but at least one)
					until there is no more room in the flex container
					in the cross dimension

							that is larger than the space left on the page,
							and the flex container is not at the top of the page already,
							move the flex container to the next page
							and restart flex container layout entirely.

						<li>
							If there are any flex items not laid out by the first step,
							rerun the flex layout algorithm
							from <a href="#main-sizing">Main Sizing Determination</a>

					For each fragment of the flex container,

			<p class='note'>

				<li>
					If an unbreakable item doesn't fit within the space left on the page,

					and restart flex container layout entirely.

				<li>
					For each item,

					rerunning the flex layout algorithm
					from <a href="#line-sizing">Line Length Determination</a>
					through <a href="#main-alignment">Main-Axis Alignment</a>
					into the new page size
					using <em>all</em> the contents (including items completed on previous pages).

					<p class='note'>
						Any flex items that fit entirely into previous fragments

	<ul>
		<li id="change-2018-bracket-range-notation">
			Changed syntax to use <a>CSS bracketed range notation</a> to reflect the prose restrictions on negative values.

		<li id="change-2018-preferred-aspect-ratio">
			Update aspect ratio terminology to use the term [=preferred aspect ratio=].

		<li id="change-2018-used-cross-size">
			Clarified that the [=flex base size=] calculations
			rely on the <em>used</em> [=cross size=].
			(<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3736">Issue 3736</a>)
			<blockquote>
				<p>&hellip; then the flex base size is calculated from
				its <ins>used</ins> inner cross size
				and the flex item’s intrinsic aspect ratio.
			</blockquote>

		<li id="change-2018-flexible-length-text">
			Slightly restructured the prose in [[#resolve-flexible-lengths]]
			to resolve <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5179">Issue 5179</a>.

		<li id="change-2018-cross-layout">
			Clarified that “performing layout” means using the block-level layout rules.
			(<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5188">Issue 5188</a>)

			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>Determine the hypothetical cross size of each item</strong>
				by performing layout <ins>as if it were an [=in-flow=] [=block-level box=]
				with the used <a>main size</a> and the <ins>given</ins> available space &hellip;
			</blockquote>

		<li id="change-2018-cross-sizing">
			Rewrote flex-contain cross-sizing step
			to depend on the rules of whatever formatting context it's in,
			rather than assuming block-layout rules.
			(<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5190">Issue 5190</a>)

			<blockquote>
				<strong>Determine the flex container's used cross size</strong>
				<ins>using the rules of the [=formatting context=] in which it participates.
				If a content-based [=cross size=] is needed,
				use the sum of the [=flex lines=]' [=cross sizes=].</ins>

				<del>
					<ul>
						<li>
							If the cross size property is a <a>definite</a> size,
							use that,
							clamped by the used min and max <a>cross sizes</a>
							of the <a>flex container</a>.

						<li>
							Otherwise,
							use the sum of the flex lines' cross sizes,
							clamped by the used min and max <a>cross sizes</a>
							of the <a>flex container</a>.
					</ul>
				</del>
			</blockquote>

		<li id="change-2018-aspect-ratio-box">
			Removed explicit mention of which box to use for calculating aspect-ratio,
			to allow for behavior introduced by the new 'aspect-ratio' property in [[css-sizing-4]].
			(<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5246/">Issue 5246</a>)

Changes since the 26 May 2016 CR</h3>

<h4 id="change-201605-substantive">
Substantive Changes and Bugfixes</h4>

	<ul>
		<li id="change-2016-box-sizing-basis">
			To allow flex factors to actually represent absolute ratios of flex item sizes
			as was originally intended (see various examples),
			removed the flooring of content-box sizes at zero
			for the purpose of finding the item’s <a>flex base size</a>,
			since this type of ratio requires a <a>flex base size</a> of zero,
			which would otherwise only be possible if margins, borders, and padding are also all zero.
			(The flooring remains in effect,
			alongside the min and max size constraints,
			in calculating the hypothetical and final sizes of the item.)
			(<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/316">Issue 316</a>)
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					When determining the <a>flex base size</a>,
					the item’s min and max main size properties are ignored
					(no clamping occurs).
					<ins>Furthermore, the sizing calculations that floor the content box size at zero
					when applying 'box-sizing' are also ignored.
					(For example, an item with a specified size of zero,
					positive padding, and ''box-sizing: border-box''
					will have an outer <a>flex base size</a> of zero--
					and hence a negative inner <a>flex base size</a>.)</ins>
				</p>
				<p>
					The <a>hypothetical main size</a> is the item's <a>flex base size</a>
					clamped according to its min and max main size properties
					<ins>(and flooring the content box size at zero)</ins>.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
					<strong>Fix min/max violations.</strong>
					Clamp each non-frozen item's <a>target main size</a> by its min and max main size properties
					<ins>and floor its content-box size at zero</ins>.
					If the item's <a>target main size</a> was made smaller by this,
					it's a max violation.

					<p>In order to preserve the author's intended ordering in all presentation modes,

					and not use 'order' to perform reordering
					unless the author has explicitly indicated that the underlying
					document order (which determines speech and navigation order) should be
					<em>out-of-sync</em> with the visual order.</p>

					<div class="example" id="example-a11y-tools">
						For example, a tool might offer both drag-and-drop reordering of flex items
						as well as handling of media queries for alternate layouts per screen size range.

						Since most of the time, reordering should affect all screen ranges
						as well as navigation and speech order,
						the tool would perform drag-and-drop reordering at the DOM layer.
						In some cases, however, the author may want different visual orderings per screen size.
						The tool could offer this functionality by using 'order' together with media queries,
						but also tie the smallest screen size's ordering to the underlying DOM order
						(since this is most likely to be a logical linear presentation order)
						while using 'order' to determine the visual presentation order in other size ranges.

						This tool would be conformant, whereas a tool that only ever used 'order'

Substantive Changes and Bugfixes</h4>

	The following significant changes were made since the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-css3-flexbox-20120918/">18 September 2012 Candidate Recommendation</a>:

	<ul>
	<!-- Apparently we forgot to actually edit in this change. See above.
		<li id="change-2012-flex-grow-animation">
			Removed the restriction on animating between 0 and non-0 values in 'flex-grow' and 'flex-shrink',
			as the layout algo no longer has a discontinuity in behavior there.
	-->
		<li id="change-2012-min-width">
			Changed the behavior of the new ''min-width/auto'' initial value of 'min-width'/'min-height' to
			<ul>
				<li>Take into account whether 'overflow' is ''overflow/visible'',
					since when 'overflow' is explicitly handled, it is confusing (and unnecessary)
					to force enough size to show all the content.
				<li>Take into account the specified 'width'/'height',
					so that the implied minimum is never greater than the specified size.
				<li>Compute to itself (not to ''width/min-content'') on flex items,
					since they are no longer equivalent (due to above changes).
			</ul>

							<p class='note'>
								It is intended that this will compute to the ''width/min-content'' keyword
								when the specification defining it ([[CSS-SIZING-3]]) is sufficiently mature.
							</p>

				<del>
					<p>
						However, if both 'left' and 'right' or both 'top' and 'bottom' are ''auto'',
						then the used value of those properties
						are computed from its static position, as follows:

					<p>
						If both 'left' and 'right' are ''auto'',
						the <a>flex item</a> must be positioned so that
						its <a>main-start</a> or <a>cross-start</a> edge
						(whichever is in the horizontal axis)
						is aligned with the <a>static position</a>.
						If both 'top' and 'bottom' are ''auto'',
						the <a>flex item</a> must be positioned so that
						its <a>main-start</a> or <a>cross-start</a> edge
						(whichever is in the vertical axis)
						is aligned with the <a>static position</a>.

					<p>
						In the <a>main axis</a>,

					<ol>
						<li>
							If there is a subsequent in-flow <a>flex item</a> on the same <a>flex line</a>,
							the <a>static position</a> is the outer <a>main-start</a> edge of that <a>flex item</a>.

						<li>
							Otherwise, if there is a preceding in-flow <a>flex item</a> on the same <a>flex line</a>,
							the <a>static position</a> is the outer <a>main-end</a> edge of that <a>flex item</a>.

						<li>
							Otherwise, the <a>static position</a> is determined
							by the value of 'justify-content' on the <a>flex container</a>

					<p class='note'>
						The static position is intended to more-or-less match the position of
						an anonymous 0&times;0 in-flow ''align-self/flex-start''-aligned
						flex item that participates in flex layout,
						the primary difference being that any packing spaces due to
						''justify-content: space-around'' or ''justify-content: space-between''

						else between it and the previous item (if any) if there isn't.</p>

					assuming both the child and the <a>flex container</a>
					were fixed size boxes of their used size.
					<div class='example'>
						For example, by default, the static position of
						an absolutely positioned child aligns it to the main-start/cross-start corner,
						corresponding to the default values of 'justify-content' and 'align-content' on the <a>flex container</a>.
						Setting ''justify-content:center'' on the <a>flex container</a>, however,

Privacy and Security Considerations {#priv-sec}

	Flexbox introduces no new privacy leaks,
