Introduction</h2>

<div class=non-normative>
<em>This section is not normative.</em>

CSS 2.1 [[!CSS21]] specifies an
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#containing-block-details">
initial containing block</a> for [=continuous media=] that has the dimensions
of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#viewport">
viewport</a>. Since the viewport is generally no larger than the display,
devices with smaller displays such as phones or tablets typically present
a smaller viewport than larger devices like desktop or laptops.

Unfortunately, many documents have historically been designed against larger
viewports and exhibit a variety of bugs when viewed in smaller viewports.
These include unintended layout wrapping, clipped content, awkward scrollable
bounds, and script errors. To avoid these issues, mobile browsers generally
use a fixed initial containing block width that mimics common desktop browser
window size (typically 980-1024px). The resulting layout is then scaled down
to fit in the available screen space.

Although this approach mitigates the issues mentioned above, the downscaling
means the CSS pixel size will be smaller than
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#length-units">recommended</a>
by CSS 2.1. Users will likely need to zoom on the content to view it
comfortably.

This mitigation is unnecessary for sites that have been designed to work
well on small viewports.

Issue: This specification is written from an implementation-centric point of view,
making it arguably difficult to read.
Significant editorial work may be needed
to make it more understandable to different audiences.
It also should clarify which viewport is referred to by various js APIs.
See <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/09/a_new_device_ad.html">this blog post by ppk</a>
for a good discussion of these issues.

Issue: Various issues about this specification and related specifications
are listed in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/Proposals/Investigation_of_APIs_for_Level_of_detail#The_issues_on_existing_APIs">this report</a>.
</div>

<h2 id="the-viewport">
The viewport</h2>

In CSS 2.1 a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#viewport">viewport</a>
is a feature of a user agent for [=continuous media=] and used to
establish the initial containing block for [=continuous media=].
For [=paged media=], the initial containing block is based on the page area.
The page area can be set through ''@page'' rules.

This specification introduces a way of overriding the size of the viewport
provided by the user agent (UA). Because of this, we need to introduce the
difference between the ''initial viewport'' and the ''actual viewport''.

<dl>
	<dt><dfn>initial viewport</dfn></dt>
	<dd>
		This refers to the viewport before any UA or author styles have
		overridden the viewport given by the window or viewing area of the UA.
		Note that the ''initial viewport'' size will change with the
		size of the window or viewing area.</dd>
	<dt><dfn>actual viewport</dfn></dt>
	<dd>
		This is the viewport you get after processing the viewport
		<code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag.
	</dd>
</dl>

ISSUE: Make ''actual viewport'' the layout viewport, define visual viewport.

When the ''actual viewport'' cannot fit inside the window or
viewing area, either because the ''actual viewport'' is
larger than the ''initial viewport'' or the zoom factor
causes only parts of the ''actual viewport'' to be visible,
the UA should offer a scrolling or panning mechanism.

It is recommended that initially the upper-left corners of the
''actual viewport'' and the window or viewing area are aligned if the
base direction of the document is ltr. Similarly, that the upper-right
corners are aligned when the base direction is rtl. The base direction
for a document is defined as the computed value of the 'direction'
property for the first <code class=html>&lt;BODY&gt;</code> element of
an HTML or XHTML document. For other document types, it is the
computed 'direction' for the root element.

Viewport <code class=html>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element</h2>

Issue: Specify me

<h3 id="meta-properties">
Properties</h3>

The recognized properties in the viewport
<code class=html>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element are:

<ul>
	<li><code class="index" lt="width!!viewport meta">width</code></li>
	<li><code class="index" lt="height!!viewport meta">height</code></li>
	<li><code class="index">initial-scale</code></li>
	<li><code class="index">minimum-scale</code></li>
	<li><code class="index">maximum-scale</code></li>
	<li><code class="index">user-scalable</code></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="parsing-algorithm">
Parsing algorithm</h3>

Below is an algorithm for parsing the <code class=html>content</code>
attribute of the <code class=html>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag produced
from testing Safari on the iPhone. <span class="note"> The testing was
done on an iPod touch running iPhone OS 4. The UA string of the
browser: <code>"Mozilla/5.0 (iPod; U; CPU iPhone OS 4_0 like Mac OS X;
en-us) AppleWebKit/532.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.5
Mobile/8A293 Safari/6531.22.7"</code>.</span> The pseudo code notation
used is based on the notation used in [[Algorithms]].

The whitespace class contains the following characters (ascii):

<ul>
	<li>Horizontal tab (0x09)</li>
	<li>Line feed (0x0a)</li>
	<li>Carriage return (0x0d)</li>
	<li>Space (0x20)</li>
</ul>

The recognized separator between property/value pairs is comma for the
Safari implementation. Some implementations have supported both commas
and semicolons. Because of that, existing content use semicolons instead
of commas. Authors should be using comma in order to ensure content works
as expected in all UAs, but implementors may add support for both to ensure
interoperability for existing content.

The separator class contains the following characters (ascii), with
comma as the preferred separator and semicolon as optional:

<ul>
	<li>Comma (0x2c)</li>
	<li>Semicolon (0x3b)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="extend-to-zoom">''extend-to-zoom''</h3>

Issue: Specify extend-to-zoom behavior by the viewport meta tag

<h3 id="interactive-widget-section">''interactive-widget''</h3>

Issue: Move the definition of ''visual viewport'' from CSSOM-View to this spec.

The <dfn export><code>interactive-widget</code></dfn> property specifies the effect that interactive UI
widgets have on the page's viewports. It defines whether widgets overlay a given viewport or whether
the viewport is shrunken so that it remains fully visible while the widget is showing. Interactive
UI widgets are transient user agent or operating system UI through which a user can provide input.

<div class="note">The most common such UI widget is a virtual keyboard.</div>

The following is a list of valid values for [=interactive-widget=] and the associated
viewport-resizing behavior:

<dl>
	<dt><dfn><code>overlays-content</code></dfn></dt>
	<dd>
		Interactive UI widgets MUST NOT [=resize=] the [=initial viewport=] nor
		the <a spec="CSSOM-VIEW">visual viewport</a>. The user agent must perform the same steps
		as when {{VirtualKeyboard/overlaysContent|VirtualKeyboard.overlaysContent}} is set to
		<code>true</code>.
	</dd>
	<dt><dfn><code>resizes-content</code></dfn></dt>
	<dd>
		Interactive UI widgets MUST [=resize=] the [=initial viewport=] by the interactive widget.
	<div class="note">
		Since the <a spec="CSSOM-VIEW">visual viewport</a>'s size is derived from the
		[=initial viewport=], [=resizes-content=] will cause a resize of both the initial and visual
		viewports.
	</div>
	</dd>
	<dt><dfn><code>resizes-visual</code></dfn></dt>
	<dd>
		Interactive UI widgets MUST [=resize=] the <a spec="CSSOM-VIEW">visual viewport</a> but MUST
		NOT [=resize=] the <a spec="CSS-VIEWPORT">initial viewport</a>.
	</dd>
</dl>

If no value, or an invalid value, is set for [=interactive-widget=], the behavior implied by
[=resizes-visual=] is used as the default.

To <dfn lt="resize">resize a viewport by an interactive widget</dfn>, subtract from it the
intersection of the viewport rect with the widget's OS reported bounding rect. In cases where this
would result in a non-rectangular viewport, the behavior is user agent defined.

<div class="note">
	Some examples where the result would non rectangular: a
	<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT207521">floating or split keyboard</a>, or a keyboard that
	<a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/VirtualKeyboardAPI/explainer.md#motivation">
	occupies only part</a> of the viewport.
</div>

<h4 id="interaction-with-virtualkeyboard-overlayscontent">
	Interaction with virtualKeyboard.overlaysContent
</h4>

[[!VIRTUAL-KEYBOARD]] provides an imperative API to apply the [=overlays-content=] behavior via
the {{VirtualKeyboard/overlaysContent|VirtualKeyboard.overlaysContent}} attribute. This attribute
shadows the value set to [=interactive-widget=], namely:

When {{VirtualKeyboard/overlaysContent|VirtualKeyboard.overlaysContent}} is set to
<code>true</code>, the UA MUST ignore any value set to [=interactive-widget=] when determining the
resizing behavior of interactive widgets.

When {{VirtualKeyboard/overlaysContent|VirtualKeyboard.overlaysContent}} is set to
<code>false</code>, the UA MUST use the value set to [=interactive-widget=], or the default behavior
if a value is not set, when determining the resizing behavior of interactive widgets.

Getting the value of {{VirtualKeyboard/overlaysContent|VirtualKeyboard.overlaysContent}} MUST return
only the value previously set to it.

<div class="note">
	That is, unless previously set, <code>VirtualKeyboard.overlaysContent</code> returns false
	even if <code>interactive-widget=overlays-content</code> is set via the <code>&ltmeta&gt</code>
	tag.

<h2 id='zoom-property'>
	The 'zoom' property
</h2>

An element becomes zoomed when the 'zoom' property has a positive computed value different than 1
(or when a flat tree ancestor has zoom).

To apply zoom, the [=used value=] of a CSS property is pre-multiplied
(before any other steps in the [=used value=] stage)
by the [=used value=] of 'zoom' for the element.
It also multiplies the [=natural size=] of all replaced elements,
background images,
and nested frames
(except for fenced frames [[!FENCED-FRAME]])
by the [=used value=] of 'zoom'.

Note: This results in a magnification or minification effect.

Note: Since this multiplication is on [=computed value=]s, it applies to
all inherited properties such as 'line-height' and 'font-size'.

Nested values of 'zoom' multiply, resulting in additional scaling of <<length>> values.
The [=used value=] for zoom is always its [=effective zoom=].

The 'zoom' property has no effect on <<length>> property values with computed values that are 'auto' or <<percentage>>.

Note: Unlike 'transform',
scaling the 'zoom' property affects layout.

Note: The computed value of 'font-size' is never <<percentage>>;
thus 'zoom' always applies.

Note: 'zoom' does not affect or prevent 'transform' scaling.

<pre class="propdef">
	Name: zoom
	Value: <<number [0,∞]>> || <<percentage [0,∞]>>
	Initial: 1
	Applies to: all <<length>> property values of all elements
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: Converted to <<number>>
	Media: visual
	Computed value: as specified, but with <<percentage>> converted to the equivalent <<number>>
	Animation type: not animatable
</pre>

The values of this property have the following meanings:

<dl dfn-for="zoom" dfn-type=value>
	<dt><dfn><<number>></dfn>
	<dd>
		Positive floating point number indicating a zoom factor.
		Numbers smaller than 1.0 indicate a "zoom out" or minification effect,
		while numbers greater than 1.0 indicate a "zoom in" or magnification effect.
		A 0 value is treated as if it was 1.

		Note: The treatment of 0 is a web compatibility quirk.

	<dt><dfn><<percentage>></dfn>
	<dd>
		Positive floating point number,
		followed by a percentage character ("%") which indicates a zoom factor multiplied by 100.
		A 0 percentage is treated as if it was 100%.

		Note: The treatment of 0 is a web compatibility quirk.

</dl>

Negative values for 'zoom' are illegal.

<div class="example">
	Example of the 'zoom' property applied during hover for magnification effect.

	<pre>
		&lt;div class="messageBox"&gt;
			&lt;div class="label"&gt;Text of the label&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;style&gt;

</div>

The <dfn>effective zoom</dfn> of an element is the product of its computed
value of 'zoom' and all flat tree ancestors' computed values of 'zoom'.

The <dfn export>scaled</dfn> value of a CSS length is the [=used value=] of that length;
in particular it includes zoom.

The <dfn export>unscaled</dfn> value of a CSS length relative to an element is the [=scaled=] value divided by the element's [=effective zoom=].

<div class="note">
	The [=effective zoom=] of an element in a nested frame may be a value other than 1 even if 'zoom' is never set on an element in that frame. This can be observed by authors via APIs such as {{Window/devicePixelRatio}} and {{Element/getBoundingClientRect}}.
</div>

<h3 id='zoom-om'>
	DOM and CSSOM interaction
</h3>

	Computed style APIs (i.e., all values returned by {{getComputedStyle()}}) that are non-auto and non-percentage lengths must be [=unscaled=].

	The {{Element/getBoundingClientRect}},
	{{Element/getClientRects}},
	and {{IntersectionObserver}} APIs must return rects with [=scaled=]
	lengths.

	All other APIs related to element geometries must return [=unscaled=] lengths.
	This is explained in detail in [[cssom-view#extensions-to-the-htmlelement-interface]].

	The {{Window/devicePixelRatio}} of a frame is multiplied by the [=effective zoom=] inherited by its parent frame.
