Introduction {#introduction}
============================

This document formally specifies the core features of the CSS Object Model (CSSOM). Other documents in the CSSOM family of specifications
as well as other CSS related specifications define extensions to these core features.

The core features of the CSSOM are oriented towards providing basic capabilities to author-defined scripts to permit access to
and manipulation of style related state information and processes.

The features defined below are fundamentally based on prior specifications of the W3C DOM Working Group, primarily
[[DOM-LEVEL-2-STYLE]]. The purposes of the present document are (1) to improve on that prior work by providing
more technical specificity (so as to improve testability and interoperability), (2) to deprecate or remove certain less-widely implemented
features no longer considered to be essential in this context, and (3) to newly specify certain extensions that have been
or expected to be widely implemented.


Terminology {#terminology}
==========================

This specification employs certain terminology from the following documents:
<cite>DOM</cite>,
<cite>HTML</cite>,
<cite>CSS Syntax</cite>,
<cite>Encoding</cite>,
<cite>URL</cite>,
<cite>Fetch</cite>,
<cite>Associating Style Sheets with XML documents</cite>
and
<cite>XML</cite>.
[[!DOM]]
[[!HTML]]
[[!CSS3SYN]]
[[!ENCODING]]
[[!URL]]
[[!FETCH]]
[[!XML-STYLESHEET]]
[[!XML]]

When this specification talks about object
<code><var>A</var></code> where <code><var>A</var></code> is actually an interface, it generally means an object implementing interface
<code><var>A</var></code>.

The terms <dfn>set</dfn> and <dfn>unset</dfn> to refer to the true and
false values of binary flags or variables, respectively. These terms are also used as verbs in which case they refer to
mutating some value to make it true or false, respectively.

The term <dfn export>supported styling language</dfn> refers to CSS.

Note: If another styling language becomes supported in user agents, this specification is expected to be updated as necessary.

The term <dfn export>supported CSS property</dfn> refers to a CSS property that the user agent
implements, including any vendor-prefixed properties, but excluding <a>custom properties</a>. A
<a>supported CSS property</a> must be in its lowercase form for the purpose of comparisons in this
specification.

In this specification the ''::before'' and ''::after'' pseudo-elements
are assumed to exist for all elements even if no box is generated for them.

When a method or an attribute is said to call another method or attribute, the user agent must invoke its internal API for that attribute or method so that
e.g. the author can't change the behavior by overriding attributes or methods with custom properties or functions in ECMAScript.

Unless otherwise stated, string comparisons are done in a <a>case-sensitive</a> manner.


Common Serializing Idioms {#common-serializing-idioms}
------------------------------------------------------

To <dfn>escape a character</dfn> means to create a string of
"<code>\</code>" (U+005C), followed by the character.

To <dfn lt="escape a character as code point|escaped as code point">escape a character as code point</dfn> means to create a
string of "<code>\</code>" (U+005C), followed by the Unicode code point as
the smallest possible number of hexadecimal digits in the range 0-9 a-f
(U+0030 to U+0039 and U+0061 to U+0066) to represent the code point in
base 16, followed by a single SPACE (U+0020).

To <dfn export>serialize an identifier</dfn> means to create a string represented
by the concatenation of, for each character of the identifier:

<ul>
 <li>If the character is NULL (U+0000), then the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD).
 <li>If the character is in the range [\1-\1f] (U+0001 to U+001F) or is U+007F, then the character
 <a>escaped as code point</a>.
 <li>If the character is the first character and is in the range \[0-9]
 (U+0030 to U+0039), then the character
 <a>escaped as code point</a>.
 <li>If the character is the second character and is in the range \[0-9]
 (U+0030 to U+0039) and the first character is a "<code>-</code>"
 (U+002D), then the character
 <a>escaped as code point</a>.
 <li>If the character is the first character and is a "<code>-</code>" (U+002D),
 and there is no second character,
 then the <a lt="escape a character">escaped</a> character.
 <li>If the character is not handled by one of the above rules and is
 greater than or equal to U+0080, is "<code>-</code>" (U+002D) or
 "<code>_</code>" (U+005F), or is in one of the ranges \[0-9] (U+0030 to
 U+0039), \[A-Z] (U+0041 to U+005A), or \[a-z] (U+0061 to U+007A), then the character
 itself.
 <li>Otherwise, the <a lt="escape a character">escaped</a>
 character.
</ul>

To <dfn export>serialize a string</dfn> means to create a string represented
by '"' (U+0022), followed by the result of applying the rules
below to each character of the given string, followed by
'"' (U+0022):

<ul>
 <li>If the character is NULL (U+0000), then the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD)
 <a>escaped as code point</a>.
 <li>If the character is in the range [\1-\1f] (U+0001 to U+001F) or is U+007F, the character
 <a>escaped as code point</a>.
 <li>If the character is '"' (U+0022) or "<code>\</code>"
 (U+005C), the <a lt="escape a character">escaped</a> character.
 <li>Otherwise, the character itself.
</ul>

Note: "<code>'</code>" (U+0027) is not escaped because strings
are always serialized with '"' (U+0022).

To <dfn export>serialize a URL</dfn> means to create a string represented by
"<code>url(</code>", followed by the
<a lt="serialize a string">serialization</a> of the URL as a
string, followed by "<code>)</code>".

To <dfn export>serialize a comma-separated list</dfn> concatenate all items of
the list in list order while separating them by "<code>, </code>", i.e.,
COMMA (U+002C) followed by a single SPACE (U+0020).

To <dfn export>serialize a whitespace-separated list</dfn> concatenate all
items of the list in list order while separating them by "<code> </code>", i.e.,
a single SPACE (U+0020).

Note: When serializing a list according to the above rules,
extraneous whitespace is not inserted prior to the first item or subsequent to
the last item. Unless otherwise specified, an empty list is serialized as the
empty string.


Media Queries {#media-queries}
==============================

Media queries are defined by the Media Queries specification. This
section defines various concepts around media queries, including their API
and serialization form.

<!-- XXX ref -->


Parsing Media Queries {#parsing-media-queries}
----------------------------------------------

To <dfn export>parse a media query list</dfn> for a
given string <var>s</var> into a media query list is defined in
the Media Queries specification. Return the list of one or more media
queries that the algorithm defined there gives. <!-- XXX ref -->

Note: A media query that ends up being "ignored" will turn
into "<code>not all</code>".

To <dfn export>parse a media query</dfn> for a given string
<var>s</var> means to follow the
<a>parse a media query list</a> steps and return null if more
than one media query is returned or a media query if a
single media query is returned.

Note: Again, a media query that ends up being "ignored" will
turn into "<code>not all</code>".


Serializing Media Queries {#serializing-media-queries}
------------------------------------------------------

To
<dfn export>serialize a media query list</dfn>
run these steps:

<ol>
 <li>If the media query list is empty return the empty string and
 terminate these steps.

 <li><a lt="serialize a media query">Serialize</a> each media query in the list of media queries, in the same order as they appear in the list of
 media queries, and then <a lt="serialize a comma-separated list">serialize</a> the list.
</ol>

To
<dfn export>serialize a media query</dfn> let
<var>s</var> be the empty string, run the steps below, and
finally return <var>s</var>:

<ol>
 <li>If the media query is negated append "<code>not</code>", followed
 by a single SPACE (U+0020), to <var>s</var>.

 <li>Let <var>type</var> be the <a lt="serialize an identifier">serialization
 as an identifier</a> of the media type of the media query,
 <a>converted to ASCII lowercase</a>.

 <li>If the media query does not contain media features append
 <var>type</var>, to <var>s</var>,
 then return <var>s</var> and terminate this algorithm.

 <li>If <var>type</var> is not "<code>all</code>" or if the
 media query is negated append <var>type</var>, followed by a
 single SPACE (U+0020), followed by "<code>and</code>", followed by a single SPACE
 (U+0020), to <var>s</var>.

 <li>Sort the media features in lexicographical order.

 <li>
  Then, for each media feature:

  <ol>
   <li>Append a "<code>(</code>" (U+0028), followed by the media feature
   name, <a>converted to ASCII lowercase</a>,
   to <var>s</var>.

   <li>If a value is given append a "<code>:</code>" (U+003A), followed
   by a single SPACE (U+0020), followed by the
   <a lt="serialize a media feature value">serialized media feature value</a>,
   to <var>s</var>.

   <li>Append a "<code>)</code>" (U+0029) to
   <var>s</var>.

   <li>If this is not the last media feature append a single SPACE (U+0020),
   followed by "<code>and</code>", followed by a single SPACE (U+0020), to
   <var>s</var>.
  </ol>

</ol>

<div class="example">
 Here are some examples of input (first column) and output (second
 column):

 <table class="complex data">
  <thead>
   <tr><th>Input<th>Output
  <tbody>
   <tr>
    <td><pre>not screen and (min-WIDTH:5px) AND (max-width:40px)</pre>
    <td><pre>not screen and (max-width: 40px) and (min-width: 5px)</pre>
   <tr>
    <td><pre>all and (color) and (color)</pre>
    <td><pre>(color)</pre>
 </table>
</div>



### Serializing Media Feature Values ### {#serializing-media-feature-values}

Issue: This should probably be done in terms of mapping it to
serializing CSS values as media features are defined in terms of CSS
values after all.

To <dfn export>serialize a media feature value</dfn>
named <var>v</var> locate <var>v</var> in the first
column of the table below and use the serialization format described in
the second column:

<table class="complex data" spec=mediaqueries-4>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Media Feature
   <th>Serialization
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>'width'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'height'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'device-width'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'device-height'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'orientation'
   <td>
    If the value is ''portrait'': "<code>portrait</code>".
    If the value is ''landscape'': "<code>landscape</code>".
  <tr>
   <td>'aspect-ratio'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'device-aspect-ratio'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'color'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'color-index'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'monochrome'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'resolution'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'scan'
   <td>
    If the value is ''progressive'': "<code>progressive</code>".
    If the value is ''interlace'': "<code>interlace</code>".
  <tr>
   <td>'grid'
   <td>...
</table>

Other specifications can extend this table and vendor-prefixed media
features can have custom serialization formats as well.


Comparing Media Queries {#comparing-media-queries}
--------------------------------------------------

To
<dfn export>compare media queries</dfn>
<var>m1</var> and <var>m2</var> means to
<a lt="serialize a media query">serialize</a> them both and
return true if they are a
<a>case-sensitive</a> match and false if they
are not.


The {{MediaList}} Interface {#the-medialist-interface}
------------------------------------------------------

An object that implements the <code>MediaList</code> interface has an associated <dfn export for=MediaList>collection of media queries</dfn>.

<pre class=idl>
[ArrayClass]
interface MediaList {
  [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] stringifier attribute DOMString mediaText;
  readonly attribute unsigned long length;
  getter DOMString? item(unsigned long index);
  void appendMedium(DOMString medium);
  void deleteMedium(DOMString medium);
};
</pre>

The object's <a>supported property indices</a> are the numbers in the range zero to one less than the number of media queries
in the <a>collection of media queries</a> represented by the collection. If there are no such media queries, then there are no
<a>supported property indices</a>.

To <dfn export>create a <code>MediaList</code> object</dfn> with a string <var>text</var>, run the following steps:
<ol>
 <li>Create a new <code>MediaList</code> object.
 <li>Set its {{MediaList/mediaText}} attribute to <var>text</var>.
 <li>Return the newly created <code>MediaList</code> object.
</ol>

The <dfn attribute for=MediaList>mediaText</dfn> attribute, on getting, must return a
<a lt="serialize a media query list">serialization</a> of the <a>collection of media queries</a>.
Setting the {{MediaList/mediaText}} attribute must run these steps:
<ol>
 <li>Empty the <a>collection of media queries</a>.
 <li>If the given value is the empty string terminate these steps.
 <li>Append all the media queries as a result of <a lt="parse a media query list">parsing</a> the given
 value to the <a>collection of media queries</a>.
</ol>

The <dfn method for=MediaList>item(<var>index</var>)</dfn> method must return a
<a lt="serialize a media query">serialization</a> of the media query in the <a>collection of media queries</a>
given by <var>index</var>, or null, if <var>index</var> is greater than or equal to the number of media queries
in the <a>collection of media queries</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=MediaList>length</dfn> attribute must return the number of media queries in the <a>collection of media
queries</a>.

The <dfn method for=MediaList>appendMedium(<var>medium</var>)</dfn> method must run these steps:
<ol>
 <li>Let <var>m</var> be the result of <a lt="parse a media query">parsing</a> the given value.
 <li>If <var>m</var> is null terminate these steps.
 <li>If <a lt="compare media queries">comparing</a> <var>m</var> with any of the media queries in the
 <a>collection of media queries</a> returns true terminate these steps.
 <li>Append <var>m</var> to the <a>collection of media queries</a>.
</ol>

The <dfn method for=MediaList>deleteMedium(<var>medium</var>)</dfn> method must run these steps:
<ol>
 <li>Let <var>m</var> be the result of <a lt="parse a media query">parsing</a> the given value.
 <li>If <var>m</var> is null terminate these steps.
 <li>Remove any media query from the <a>collection of media queries</a> for which
 <a lt="compare media queries">comparing</a> the media query with <var>m</var> returns true.
</ol>

Selectors {#selectors}
======================

Selectors are defined in the Selectors specification. This section
mainly defines how to serialize them. <!-- XXX ref -->

<!-- XXX ref universal selector etc? some are in A some not -->


Parsing Selectors {#parsing-selectors}
--------------------------------------

To
<dfn export>parse a group of selectors</dfn>
means to parse the value using the <code>selectors_group</code>
production defined in the Selectors specification and return either a
group of selectors if parsing did not fail or null if parsing did
fail. <!-- XXX ref -->


Serializing Selectors {#serializing-selectors}
----------------------------------------------

<!-- http://dump.testsuite.org/2009/cssom/serializing-selectors.htm -->

To
<dfn export>serialize a group of selectors</dfn>
<a lt="serialize a selector">serialize</a> each selector in the
group of selectors and then
<a lt="serialize a comma-separated list">serialize</a> a
comma-separated list of these serializations.

To <dfn export>serialize a selector</dfn> let
<var>s</var> be the empty string, run the steps below for each
part of the chain of the selector, and finally return
<var>s</var>:

<ol>
 <li>If there is only one <a>simple selector</a> in the
 <a>compound selectors</a> which is a
 <a>universal selector</a>, append the result of
 <a lt="serialize a simple selector">serializing</a> the
 <a>universal selector</a> to <var>s</var>.

 <li>Otherwise, for each <a>simple selector</a> in the
 <a>compound selectors</a> that is not a
 universal selector of which the
 <a>namespace prefix</a> maps to a namespace that is not the
 <a>default namespace</a>
 <a lt="serialize a simple selector">serialize</a> the
 <a>simple selector</a> and append the result to
 <var>s</var>.

 <li>If this is not the last part of the chain of the selector append a
 single SPACE (U+0020), followed by the combinator
 "<code>></code>",
 "<code>+</code>",
 "<code>~</code>",
 "<code>>></code>",
 "<code>||</code>",
 as appropriate, followed by another single SPACE (U+0020) if the combinator was
 not whitespace, to <var>s</var>.

 <li>If this is the last part of the chain of the selector and there is
 a pseudo-element, append "<code>::</code>" followed by the name of the
 pseudo-element, to <var>s</var>.
</ol>


To
<dfn export>serialize a simple selector</dfn>
let <var>s</var> be the empty string, run the steps below, and
finally return <var>s</var>:

<dl class="switch">
 <dt>type selector
 <dt>universal selector
 <dd>
  <ol>
   <li>If the <a>namespace prefix</a> maps to a namespace that is
   not the <a>default namespace</a> and is not the
   null namespace (not in a namespace) append the
   <a lt="serialize an identifier">serialization</a> of the
   <a>namespace prefix</a> as an identifier, followed by a
   "<code>|</code>" (U+007C) to <var>s</var>.

   <li>If the <a>namespace prefix</a> maps to a namespace that is
   the null namespace (not in a namespace) append
   "<code>|</code>" (U+007C) to <var>s</var>.
   <!-- This includes |* -->

   <li>If this is a type selector append the
   <a lt="serialize an identifier">serialization</a> of the element name
   as an identifier to <var>s</var>.

   <li>If this is a universal selector append "<code>*</code>" (U+002A)
   to <var>s</var>.
  </ol>


 <dt>attribute selector
 <dd>
  <ol>
   <li>Append "<code>[</code>" (U+005B) to
   <var>s</var>.

   <li>If the <a>namespace prefix</a> maps to a namespace that is
   not the null namespace (not in a namespace) append the
   <a lt="serialize an identifier">serialization</a> of the
   <a>namespace prefix</a> as an identifier, followed by a
   "<code>|</code>" (U+007C) to <var>s</var>.

   <li>Append the <a lt="serialize an identifier">serialization</a>
   of the attribute name as an identifier to <var>s</var>.

   <li>If there is an attribute value specified, append
   "<code>=</code>",
   "<code>~=</code>",
   "<code>|=</code>",
   "<code>^=</code>",
   "<code>$=</code>", or
   "<code>*=</code>"
   as appropriate (depending on the type of attribute selector), followed
   by the <a lt="serialize a string">serialization</a> of the
   attribute value as a string, to <var>s</var>.

   <li>If the attribute selector has the case-sensitivity flag present,
   append "<code> i</code>" (U+0020 U+0069) to <var>s</var>.

   <li>Append "<code>]</code>" (U+005D) to
   <var>s</var>.
  </ol>


 <dt>class selector
 <dd>Append a "<code>.</code>" (U+002E), followed by the
 <a lt="serialize an identifier">serialization</a> of the class name
 as an identifier to <var>s</var>.

 <dt>ID selector
 <dd>Append a "<code>#</code>" (U+0023), followed by the

CSS {#css-object-model}
=======================


CSS Style Sheets {#css-style-sheets}
------------------------------------

A <dfn export>CSS style sheet</dfn> is an abstract concept that
represents a style sheet as defined by the CSS specification. In the CSSOM a
<a>CSS style sheet</a> is represented as a {{CSSStyleSheet}} object. A
<a>CSS style sheet</a> has a number of associated state items:

<dl dfn-for="CSSStyleSheet">
 <dt><dfn id=concept-css-style-sheet-type>type</dfn>
 <dd>The literal string "<code>text/css</code>".

 <dt><dfn id=concept-css-style-sheet-location>location</dfn>
 <dd>Specified when created. The <a>absolute URL</a> of the first request of the
 <a>CSS style sheet</a> or null if the <a>CSS style sheet</a> was
 embedded. Does not change during the lifetime of the <a>CSS style sheet</a>.

 <dt><dfn id=concept-css-style-sheet-parent-css-style-sheet>parent CSS style sheet</dfn>
 <dd>Specified when created. The <a>CSS style sheet</a> that is the parent of the
 <a>CSS style sheet</a> or null if there is no associated parent.

 <dt><dfn id=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-node>owner node</dfn>
 <dd>Specified when created. The DOM node associated with the <a>CSS style sheet</a> or
 null if there is no associated DOM node.

 <dt><dfn id=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-css-rule>owner CSS rule</dfn>
 <dd>Specified when created. The <a for=/>CSS rule</a>
 in the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>parent CSS style sheet</a>
 that caused the inclusion of the <a>CSS style sheet</a> or null if
 there is no associated rule.

 <dt><dfn id=concept-css-style-sheet-media>media</dfn>
 <dd>
  Specified when created. The {{MediaList}} object associated with the
  <a>CSS style sheet</a>.

  If this property is specified to a string, the <a>media</a> must be set to the return value of invoking
  <a>create a <code>MediaList</code> object</a> steps for that string.

  If this property is specified to an attribute of the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner node</a>, the
  <a>media</a> must be set to the return value of invoking <a>create a <code>MediaList</code> object</a> steps
  for the value of that attribute. Whenever the attribute is set, changed or removed, the <a>media</a>'s
  {{MediaList/mediaText}} attribute must be set to the new value of the attribute, or to null if the attribute is absent.

  Note: Changing the <a>media</a>'s {{MediaList/mediaText}} attribute does not
  change the corresponding attribute on the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner node</a>.


 <dt><dfn id=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</dfn>
 <dd>
  Specified when created. The title of the <a>CSS style sheet</a>, which can be the empty string.

  <div class="example">
   In the following, the <a>title</a> is non-empty
   for the first style sheet, but is empty for the second and third style sheets.

   <pre>
   &lt;style title="papaya whip">
     body { background: #ffefd5; }
   &lt;/style>
   </pre>

   <pre>
   &lt;style title="">
     body { background: orange; }
   &lt;/style>
   </pre>

   <pre>
   &lt;style>
     body { background: brown; }
   &lt;/style>
   </pre>
  </div>

  If this property is specified to an attribute of the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner node</a>, the
  <a>title</a> must be set to the value of that attribute. Whenever the attribute is set, changed or removed, the
  <a>title</a> must be set to the new value of the attribute, or to the empty string if the attribute is absent.



 <dt><dfn id=concept-css-style-sheet-alternate-flag>alternate flag</dfn>
 <dd>
  Specified when created. Either set or unset. Unset by default.

  <div class="example">
   The following <a>CSS style sheets</a> have
   their <a>alternate flag</a> set:

   <pre>&lt;?xml-stylesheet alternate="yes" title="x" href="data:text/css,&hellip;"?></pre>

   <pre>&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="x" href="data:text/css,&hellip;"></pre>
  </div>


 <dt><dfn id=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</dfn>
 <dd>
  Either set or unset. Unset by default.

  Note: Even when unset it does not necessarily mean that the
  <a>CSS style sheet</a> is actually used for rendering.



 <dt><dfn id=concept-css-style-sheet-css-rules>CSS rules</dfn>
 <dd>The CSS rules associated with the
 <a>CSS style sheet</a>.

 <dt><dfn id=concept-css-style-sheet-origin-clean-flag>origin-clean flag</dfn>
 <dd>Specified when created. Either set or unset. If it is set, the API allows reading and modifying of the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>CSS rules</a>.
</dl>


### The {{StyleSheet}} Interface ### {#the-stylesheet-interface}

The {{StyleSheet}} interface represents an abstract, base style sheet.

<pre class=idl>
interface StyleSheet {
  readonly attribute DOMString type;
  readonly attribute DOMString? href;
  readonly attribute (Element or ProcessingInstruction)? ownerNode;
  readonly attribute StyleSheet? parentStyleSheet;
  readonly attribute DOMString? title;
  [SameObject, PutForwards=mediaText] readonly attribute MediaList media;
  attribute boolean disabled;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=StyleSheet>type</dfn> attribute must return the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>type</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=StyleSheet>href</dfn> attribute must return the <a>location</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=StyleSheet>ownerNode</dfn> attribute must return the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner node</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=StyleSheet>parentStyleSheet</dfn> attribute must return the
<a for=CSSStyleSheet>parent CSS style sheet</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=StyleSheet>title</dfn> attribute must return the <a>title</a> or null if
<a>title</a> is the empty string.

The <dfn attribute for=StyleSheet>media</dfn> attribute must return the <a>media</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=StyleSheet>disabled</dfn> attribute, on getting, must return true if the
<a>disabled flag</a>
is set, or false otherwise. On setting, the {{StyleSheet/disabled}} attribute must set the
<a>disabled flag</a> if the new value is true, or unset the
<a>disabled flag</a> otherwise.


### The {{CSSStyleSheet}} Interface ### {#the-cssstylesheet-interface}

The {{CSSStyleSheet}} interface represents a <a>CSS style sheet</a>.

<pre class=idl>
interface CSSStyleSheet : StyleSheet {
  readonly attribute CSSRule? ownerRule;
  [SameObject] readonly attribute CSSRuleList cssRules;
  unsigned long insertRule(DOMString rule, unsigned long index);
  void deleteRule(unsigned long index);
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=CSSStyleSheet>ownerRule</dfn> attribute must return the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner CSS rule</a>.
If a value other than null is ever returned, then that same value must always be returned on each get access.

The <dfn attribute for=CSSStyleSheet>cssRules</dfn> attribute must follow these steps:

<ol>
 <li>If the <a>origin-clean flag</a> is unset,
 <a>throw</a> a {{SecurityError}} exception.
 <li>Return a read-only, live {{CSSRuleList}} object representing
 the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>CSS rules</a>.

 Note: Even though the returned {{CSSRuleList}} object is read-only (from the perspective of
 client-authored script), it can nevertheless change over time due to its liveness status. For example, invoking
 the {{CSSStyleSheet/insertRule()}} or {{CSSStyleSheet/deleteRule()}} methods can result in
 mutations reflected in the returned object.

</ol>

The <dfn method for=CSSStyleSheet>insertRule(<var>rule</var>, <var>index</var>)</dfn> method must run the following steps:

<ol>
 <li>If the <a>origin-clean flag</a> is unset,
 <a>throw</a> a {{SecurityError}} exception.
 <li>Return the result of invoking <a>insert a CSS rule</a> <var>rule</var> in the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>CSS rules</a>
 at <var>index</var>.
</ol>

The <dfn method for=CSSStyleSheet>deleteRule(<var>index</var>)</dfn> method must run the following steps:

<ol>
 <li>If the <a>origin-clean flag</a> is unset,
 <a>throw</a> a {{SecurityError}} exception.
 <li><a>Remove a CSS rule</a> in the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>CSS rules</a> at <var>index</var>.
</ol>

CSS Style Sheet Collections {#css-style-sheet-collections}
----------------------------------------------------------

Below various new concepts are defined that are associated with each
{{Document}} object.

Each {{Document}} has an associated list of zero or more
<a>CSS style sheets</a>, named the
<dfn>document CSS style sheets</dfn>. This is
an ordered list that contains all
<a>CSS style sheets</a> associated with the
{{Document}}, in
<a>tree order</a>, with
<a>CSS style sheets</a> created from HTTP
<code>Link</code> headers first, if any, in header
order.

To <dfn>create a CSS style sheet</dfn>, run these
steps:

<ol>
 <li>Create a new <a>CSS style sheet</a> object and set its
 properties as specified.

 <li>
  Then run the <a>add a CSS style sheet</a> steps for the newly created <a>CSS style sheet</a>.

  <p class=warning>If the <a>origin-clean flag</a> is unset, this can expose information from the user's
  intranet.
</ol>

To <dfn>add a CSS style sheet</dfn>, run these
steps:

<ol>
 <li>Add the <a>CSS style sheet</a> to the list of
 <a>document CSS style sheets</a> at the appropriate location. The
 remainder of these steps deal with the
 <a>disabled flag</a>.

 <li>If the <a>disabled flag</a> is set, terminate
 these steps.

 <li>If the <a>title</a> is not the empty string, the
 <a>alternate flag</a> is unset, and
 <a>preferred CSS style sheet set name</a> is the empty string
 <a>change the preferred CSS style sheet set name</a> to the
 <a>title</a>.

 <li>
  If any of the following is true unset the
  <a>disabled flag</a> and terminate these steps:

  <ul>
   <li>The <a>title</a> is the empty string.
   <li>The <a>last CSS style sheet set name</a> is null and the
   <a>title</a> is a
   <a>case-sensitive</a> match
   for the <a>preferred CSS style sheet set name</a>.
   <li>The <a>title</a> is a
   <a>case-sensitive</a> match for the
   <a>last CSS style sheet set name</a>.
  </ul>


 <li>Set the <a>disabled flag</a>.
</ol>

To <dfn>remove a CSS style sheet</dfn>, run these steps:

<ol>
 <li>Remove the <a>CSS style sheet</a> from the list of <a>document CSS style sheets</a>.

 <li>Set the <a>CSS style sheet</a>'s <a for=CSSStyleSheet>parent CSS style sheet</a>,
 <a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner node</a> and <a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner CSS rule</a> to null.

 <!-- "associated CSS style sheet" is defined in terms of owner node, so we don't need to set it to null explicitly -->

 <!-- XXX does anything need to happen wrt alternate style sheets? what if the last style sheet with the preferred style sheet set name is removed? -->
</ol>

A <dfn>persistent CSS style sheet</dfn> is a
<a>CSS style sheet</a> from the <a>document CSS style sheets</a>
whose <a>title</a> is the empty string and whose
<a>alternate flag</a> is unset.

A <dfn>CSS style sheet set</dfn> is an ordered
collection of one or more <a>CSS style sheets</a>
from the <a>document CSS style sheets</a> which have an identical
<a>title</a> that is not the empty string.

A <dfn>CSS style sheet set name</dfn> is the
<a>title</a> the <a>CSS style sheet set</a> has in
common.

An <dfn>enabled CSS style sheet set</dfn> is a
<a>CSS style sheet set</a> of which each <a>CSS style sheet</a> has
its <a>disabled flag</a> unset.

To <dfn>enable a CSS style sheet set</dfn>
with name <var>name</var>, run these steps:

<ol>
 <li>If <var>name</var> is the empty string, set the
 <a>disabled flag</a> for each <a>CSS style sheet</a>
 that is in a <a>CSS style sheet set</a> and terminate these steps.

 <li>Unset the <a>disabled flag</a> for each
 <a>CSS style sheet</a> in a <a>CSS style sheet set</a> whose
 <a>CSS style sheet set name</a> is a
 <a>case-sensitive</a> match for
 <var>name</var> and set it for all other
 <a>CSS style sheets</a> in a
 <a>CSS style sheet set</a>.
</ol>

To <dfn>select a CSS style sheet set</dfn>
with name <var>name</var>, run these steps:

<ol>
 <li><a>enable a CSS style sheet set</a> with name
 <var>name</var>.

 <li>Set <a>last CSS style sheet set name</a> to
 <var>name</var>.
</ol>

A <dfn>last CSS style sheet set name</dfn>
is a concept to determine what <a>CSS style sheet set</a> was last
<a lt="select a CSS style sheet set">selected</a>. Initially its
value is null.

A
<dfn>preferred CSS style sheet set name</dfn>
is a concept to determine which
<a>CSS style sheets</a> need to have their
<a>disabled flag</a> unset. Initially its value
is the empty string.

To
<dfn>change the preferred CSS style sheet set name</dfn>
with name <var>name</var>, run these steps:

<ol>
 <li>Let <var>current</var> be the <a>preferred CSS style sheet set name</a>.

 <li>Set <a>preferred CSS style sheet set name</a> to
 <var>name</var>.

 <li>If <var>name</var> is not a
 <a>case-sensitive</a> match for
 <var>current</var> and
 <a>last CSS style sheet set name</a> is null
 <a>enable a CSS style sheet set</a> with name
 <var>name</var>.
</ol>

<!-- XXX ought to define "applied"

thoughts:
  depends on disabled flag, alternate flag, media queries, sheesh
 -->


### The HTTP Default-Style Header ### {#the-http-default-style-header}

The HTTP <a lt="http-default-style">Default-Style</a> header
can be used to set the <a>preferred CSS style sheet set name</a>
influencing which <a>CSS style sheet set</a> is (initially) the
<a>enabled CSS style sheet set</a>.

For each HTTP <a lt="http-default-style">Default-Style</a>
header, in header order, the user agent must
<a>change the preferred CSS style sheet set name</a> with name being the
value of the header.


### The {{StyleSheetList}} Interface ### {#the-stylesheetlist-interface}

The {{StyleSheetList}} interface represents an ordered collection of <a>CSS style sheets</a>.

<pre class=idl>
[ArrayClass]
interface StyleSheetList {
  getter StyleSheet? item(unsigned long index);
  readonly attribute unsigned long length;
};
</pre>

The object's <a>supported property indices</a> are the numbers in the range zero to one less than the number of
<a>CSS style sheets</a> represented by the collection. If there are no such <a>CSS style sheets</a>,
then there are no <a>supported property indices</a>.

The <dfn method for=StyleSheetList>item(<var>index</var>)</dfn> method must return the <var>index</var>th <a>CSS style
sheet</a> in the collection. If there is no <var>index</var>th object in the collection, then the method must return null.

The <dfn attribute for=StyleSheetList>length</dfn> attribute must return the number of <a>CSS style sheets</a>
represented by the collection.

### Extensions to the {{Document}} Interface ### {#extensions-to-the-document-interface}

<pre class=idl>
partial interface Document {
  [SameObject] readonly attribute StyleSheetList styleSheets;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=Document>styleSheets</dfn> attribute must return a {{StyleSheetList}} collection representing
the <a>document CSS style sheets</a>.


Style Sheet Association {#style-sheet-association}
--------------------------------------------------

This section defines the interface an
<a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner node</a> of a <a>CSS style sheet</a> has to
implement and defines the requirements for
<a>xml-stylesheet processing instructions</a>
and HTTP <code>Link</code> headers when the link
relation type is an
<a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for
"<code>stylesheet</code>".


### Fetching CSS style sheets ### {#fetching-css-style-sheets}

To <dfn>fetch a CSS style sheet</dfn> with parsed URL <var>parsed URL</var>, referrer <var>referrer</var>, document
<var>document</var>, optionally a set of parameters <var>parameters</var> (used as input to creating a
<a>request</a>), follow these steps:

<ol>
 <li>Let <var>origin</var> be <var>document</var>'s <a>origin</a>.

 <li>Let <var>request</var> be a new <a>request</a>, with the
 <a for=request>url</a> <var>parsed URL</var>,
 <a for=request>origin</a> <var>origin</var>,
 <a for=request>referrer</a> <var>referrer</var>, and if specified the set of parameters <var>parameters</var>.

 <li>Let <var>response</var> be the result of <a>fetching</a> <var>request</var>.

 <li>Wait until <var>response</var> is available.

 <li>If <var>response</var> is a <a>network error</a>, return an error.

 <li>If <var>document</var> is in <a>quirks mode</a>, <var>response</var> is
 <a>CORS-same-origin</a><!--XXX xref--> and the <a>Content-Type metadata</a> of <var>response</var> is not a
 <a>supported styling language</a> change the <a>Content-Type metadata</a> of <var>response</var> to
 <code>text/css</code>.

 <li>If <var>response</var> is not in a <a>supported styling language</a> return an error.

 <li>Return <var>response</var>.
</ol>

### The {{LinkStyle}} Interface ### {#the-linkstyle-interface}

The <dfn>associated CSS style sheet</dfn> of a node is the <a>CSS style sheet</a> in the list of
<a>document CSS style sheets</a> of which the <a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner node</a> implements the {{LinkStyle}}
interface.

<pre class=idl>
[NoInterfaceObject]
interface LinkStyle {
  readonly attribute StyleSheet? sheet;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=LinkStyle>sheet</dfn> attribute must return the <a>associated CSS style sheet</a> for the node or null
if there is no <a>associated CSS style sheet</a>.

<div class="example">
 In the following fragment, the first <{style}>
 element has a {{LinkStyle/sheet}} attribute that returns a
 {{StyleSheet}} object representing the style sheet, but for
 the second <{style}> element, the {{LinkStyle/sheet}} attribute returns null,
 assuming the user agent supports CSS (<code>text/css</code>), but does
 not support the (hypothetical) ExampleSheets (<code>text/example-sheets</code>).

 <pre>
 &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
   body { background:lime }
 &lt;/style&gt;
 </pre>
 <pre>
 &lt;style type="text/example-sheets"&gt;
   $(body).background := lime
 &lt;/style&gt;
 </pre>
</div>

Note: Whether or not the node refers to a style sheet is defined
by the specification that defines the semantics of said node.


### Requirements on specifications ### {#requirements-on-specifications}

Specifications introducing new ways of associating style sheets through
the DOM should define which nodes implement the
{{LinkStyle}} interface. When doing so, they
must also define when a <a>CSS style sheet</a> is
<a lt="create a CSS style sheet">created</a>.


### Requirements on User Agents Implementing the xml-stylesheet processing instruction ### {#requirements-on-user-agents-implementing-the-xml-stylesheet-processing-instruction}

<!-- XXX load/error events -->

<pre class="idl">ProcessingInstruction implements LinkStyle;</pre>

The <dfn>prolog</dfn> refers to <a>nodes</a> that are children of the
<a>document</a> and are not <a>following</a> the
{{Element}} child of the <a>document</a>, if any.

When a <code>ProcessingInstruction</code> <a>node</a> <var>node</var> becomes part of the
<a>prolog</a>, is no longer part of the <a>prolog</a>, or has its <a>data</a> changed, these steps
must be run:

<ol>
 <li>If an instance of this algorithm is currently running for <var>node</var>, abort that instance, and stop the associated
 <a>fetching</a> if applicable.

 <li>If <var>node</var> has an <a>associated CSS style sheet</a>, <a lt="remove a CSS style sheet">remove</a> it.

 <li>If <var>node</var> is not an <a>xml-stylesheet processing instruction</a>, terminate these steps.

 <li>If <var>node</var> does not have an <code>href</code> <a>pseudo-attribute</a>, terminate these steps.

 <li>Let <var>title</var> be the value of the
 <code>title</code> <a>pseudo-attribute</a> or the empty string if the
 <code>title</code> <a>pseudo-attribute</a> is not specified.

 <li>If there is an <code>alternate</code> <a>pseudo-attribute</a>
 whose value is a <a>case-sensitive</a> match
 for "<code>yes</code>" and <var>title</var> is the
 empty string terminate these steps.

 <li>If there is a <code>type</code> <a>pseudo-attribute</a> whose
 value is not a <a>supported styling language</a> the user agent
 may terminate these steps.

 <li>Let <var>input URL</var> be the value specified by the
 <code>href</code> <a>pseudo-attribute</a>.

 <li>Let <var>document</var> be <var>node</var>'s <a>node document</a>

 <li>Let <var>base URL</var> be <var>document</var>'s <a>document base URL</a>.

 <li>Let <var>referrer</var> be <var>document</var>'s <a lt="document URL">address</a>.

 <li>Let <var>parsed URL</var> be the return value of invoking the <a>URL parser</a> with the
 string <var>input URL</var> and the base URL <var>base URL</var>.

 <li>If <var>parsed URL</var> is failure, terminate these steps.

 <li>Let <var>response</var> be the result of <a lt="fetch a CSS style sheet">fetching a CSS style sheet</a> with parsed URL <var>parsed URL</var>,
 referrer <var>referrer</var> and document <var>document</var>.

 <li>If <var>response</var> is an error, terminate these steps.

 <li>
  <a>Create a CSS style sheet</a> with the following properties:

  <dl>
   <dt><a>location</a>
   <dd>The result of invoking the <a>URL serializer</a> with <var>parsed URL</var>.

   <dt><a for=CSSStyleSheet>parent CSS style sheet</a>
   <dd>null.

   <dt><a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner node</a>
   <dd><var>node</var>.

   <dt><a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner CSS rule</a>
   <dd>null.

   <dt><a>media</a>
   <dd>The value of the <code>media</code> <a>pseudo-attribute</a>
   if any, or the empty string otherwise.

   <dt><a>title</a>
   <dd><var>title</var>.

   <dt><a>alternate flag</a>
   <dd>Set if the <code>alternate</code> <a>pseudo-attribute</a>
   value is a <a>case-sensitive</a> match for
   "<code>yes</code>", or unset otherwise.

   <dt><a>origin-clean flag</a>
   <dd>Set if <var>response</var> is <a>CORS-same-origin</a><!--XXX xref-->, or unset otherwise.
  </dl>

  The CSS <a>environment encoding</a> is the result of running the following steps:

  <ol>
   <li>If the element has a <code>charset</code>
   <a>pseudo-attribute</a>,
   <a>get an encoding</a> from that pseudo-attribute's value.
   If that succeeds, return the resulting encoding and abort these steps.

   <li>Otherwise, return the <a lt="encoding" for="Document">document's character encoding</a>.
   [[!DOM]]
  </ol>

</ol>

A style sheet referenced by an <a>xml-stylesheet processing instruction</a> using the rules in this section, in the context of
the {{Document}} of an <a>XML parser</a> is said to be
<a>a style sheet that is blocking scripts</a> if the <code>ProcessingInstruction</code>
<a>node</a> was created by that {{Document}}'s parser, and the style sheet was
enabled when the node was created by the parser, and the <a>style sheet ready</a> flag is not yet set, and, the last time the
<a>event loop</a> reached step 1, the node was in that Document, and the user agent hasn't given up on that particular style sheet
yet. A user agent may give up on such a style sheet at any time.

### Requirements on User Agents Implementing the HTTP Link Header ### {#requirements-on-user-agents-implementing-the-http-link-header}

<!-- XXX ref, one day -->

<!-- XXX deal with media param -->

<p class=atrisk>For each HTTP <code>Link</code> header of which one
of the link relation types is an
<a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match
for "<code>stylesheet</code>" these steps
must be run:

<ol>
 <li>Let <var>title</var> be the value of the first of all the
 <code>title</code> parameters.
 If there are no such parameters it is the empty string.

 <li>If one of the (other) link relation types is an
 <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for
 "<code>alternate</code>" and <var>title</var> is the
 empty string terminate these steps.

 <li>Let <var>input URL</var> be the value specified.

 Issue: Be more specific

 <li>Let <var>base URL</var> be the document's <a>document base URL</a>.

 Issue: Is there a document at this point?

 <li>Let <var>referrer</var> be the document's <a lt="document URL">address</a>.

 <li>Let <var>origin</var> be the document's <a>origin</a>.

 <li>Let <var>parsed URL</var> be the return value of invoking the <a>URL parser</a> with the
 string <var>input URL</var> and the base URL <var>base URL</var>.

 <li>If <var>parsed URL</var> is failure, terminate these steps.

 <li>Let <var>response</var> be the result of <a lt="fetch a CSS style sheet">fetching a CSS style sheet</a> with parsed URL <var>parsed URL</var>,

 Issue: What if the HTML parser hasn't decided on quirks/non-quirks yet?

 <li>
  <a>Create a CSS style sheet</a> with the following properties:

  <dl>
   <dt><a>location</a>
   <dd>The result of invoking the <a>URL serializer</a> with <var>parsed URL</var>.

   <dt><a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner node</a>
   <dd>null.

   <dt><a for=CSSStyleSheet>parent CSS style sheet</a>
   <dd>null.

   <dt><a for=CSSStyleSheet>owner CSS rule</a>
   <dd>null.

   <dt><a>media</a>
   <dd>The value of the first <code>media</code> parameter.
   <!-- XXX register media parameter? bah -->

   <dt><a>title</a>
   <dd><var>title</var>.

   <dt><a>alternate flag</a>
   <dd>Set if one of the specified link relation type for this HTTP
   <code>Link</code> header is an
   <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for
   "<code>alternate</code>", or false otherwise.

   <dt><a>origin-clean flag</a>
   <dd>Set if <var>response</var> is <a>CORS-same-origin</a><!--XXX xref-->, or unset otherwise.
  </dl>

</ol>

A style sheet referenced by a HTTP <code>Link</code> header using the rules in this section is said to be <a>a style sheet
that is blocking scripts</a> if the style sheet was enabled when created, and the <a>style sheet ready</a> flag is not yet set,
and the user agent hasn't given up on that particular style sheet yet. A user agent may give up on such a style sheet at any time.

CSS Rules {#css-rules}
----------------------

A <dfn>CSS rule</dfn> is an abstract concept that
denotes a rule as defined by the CSS specification. A
<a for=/>CSS rule</a> is represented as an object that implements a subclass of
the {{CSSRule}} interface, and which has the following
associated state items:

<dl dfn-for="CSSRule">
<dt><dfn id=concept-css-rule-type>type</dfn>
<dd>A non-negative integer associated with a particular type of rule.
This item is initialized when a rule is created and cannot change.

<dt><dfn id=concept-css-rule-text>text</dfn>
<dd>A text representation of the rule suitable for direct use in a style sheet.
This item is initialized when a rule is created and can be changed.

<dt><dfn id=concept-css-rule-parent-css-rule>parent CSS rule</dfn>
<dd>A reference to an enclosing <a for=/>CSS rule</a> or null.
If the rule has an enclosing rule when it is created, then this item is initialized to the enclosing rule; otherwise it is null. It can be changed to
null.

<dt><dfn id=concept-css-rule-parent-css-style-sheet>parent CSS style sheet</dfn>
<dd>A reference to a parent <a>CSS style sheet</a> or null.
This item is initialized to reference an associated style sheet when the rule is created. It can be changed to null.

<dt><dfn id=concept-css-rule-child-css-rules>child CSS rules</dfn>
<dd>A list of child <a for=/>CSS rules</a>. The list can be mutated.
</dl>

In addition to the above state, each <a for=/>CSS rule</a> may be associated
with other state in accordance with its <a for=CSSRule>type</a>.

To <dfn>parse a CSS rule</dfn> from a string <var>string</var>, run the following steps:

<ol>
 <li>Let <var>rule</var> be the return value of invoking <a>parse a rule</a> with <var>string</var>.
 <li>If <var>rule</var> is a syntax error, return <var>rule</var>.
 <li>Let <var>parsed rule</var> be the result of parsing <var>rule</var> according to the appropriate CSS specifications, dropping parts that are said to be
 ignored. If the whole style rule is dropped, return a syntax error.
 <li>Return <var>parsed rule</var>.
</ol>

To <dfn>serialize a CSS rule</dfn>, perform one of the following in accordance with the <a for=/>CSS rule</a>'s
<a for=CSSRule>type</a>:

<dl class="switch">
 <dt>{{CSSStyleRule}}
 <dd>
  The result of concatenating the following:
  <ol>
   <li>The result of performing <a>serialize a group of selectors</a> on the rule's associated selectors.
   <li>The string "<code> { </code>", i.e., a single SPACE (U+0020), followed by LEFT CURLY BRACKET (U+007B),
   followed by a single SPACE (U+0020).
   <li>The result of performing <a>serialize a CSS declaration block</a> on the rule's associated declarations.
   <li>If the rule is associated with one or more declarations, the string "<code> </code>", i.e., a single SPACE (U+0020).
   <li>The string "<code>}</code>", RIGHT CURLY BRACKET (U+007D).
  </ol>


 <dt>{{CSSImportRule}}
 <dd>
  The result of concatenating the following:
  <ol>
   <li>The string "<code>@import</code>" followed by a single SPACE (U+0020).
   <li>The result of performing <a>serialize a URL</a> on the rule's location.
   <li>If the rule's associated media list is not empty, a single SPACE (U+0020) followed by the
   result of performing <a>serialize a media query list</a> on the media list.
   <li>The string "<code>;</code>", i.e., SEMICOLON (U+003B).
  </ol>
  <div class="example">
  <pre>@import url("import.css");</pre>
  <pre>@import url("print.css") print;</pre>
  </div>


 <dt>{{CSSMediaRule}}
 <dd>Issue: ...

 <dt>{{CSSFontFaceRule}}
 <dd>Issue: ...

 <dt>{{CSSPageRule}}
 <dd>Issue: ...

 <dt>{{CSSNamespaceRule}}
 <dd>The literal string "<code>@namespace</code>", followed by a single SPACE
 (U+0020), followed by the
 <a lt="serialize an identifier">serialization as an identifier</a> of the
 {{CSSNamespaceRule/prefix}} attribute (if
 any), followed by a single SPACE (U+0020) if there is a prefix, followed by the
 <a lt="serialize a URL">serialization as URL</a> of the
 {{CSSNamespaceRule/namespaceURI}}
 attribute, followed the character "<code>;</code>" (U+003B).
</dl>

To <dfn>insert a CSS rule</dfn> <var>rule</var> in a CSS rule list <var>list</var> at index <var>index</var>, follow these steps:
<ol>
 <li>Set <var>new rule</var> to the results of performing <a>parse a CSS rule</a>
 on argument <var>rule</var>.
 <li>If <var>new rule</var> is a syntax error, <a>throw</a>
 a {{SyntaxError}} exception.
 <li>Set <var>length</var> to the number of items in <var>list</var>.
 <li>If <var>index</var> is greater than <var>length</var>, then <a>throw</a>
 an {{IndexSizeError}} exception.
 <li>If <var>new rule</var> cannot be inserted into <var>list</var> at the zero-index position <var>index</var> due to constraints
 specified by CSS, then <a>throw</a>
 a {{HierarchyRequestError}} exception. [[!CSS21]]

 Note: For example, a CSS style sheet cannot contain an <code>@import</code> at-rule after a style rule.

 <li>If <var>new rule</var> is an <code>@namespace</code> at-rule, and <var>list</var> contains anything other than
 <code>@import</code> at-rules, and <code>@namespace</code> at-rules,
 <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception.
 <li>Insert <var>new rule</var> into <var>list</var> at the zero-indexed position <var>index</var>.
 <li>Return <var>index</var>.
</ol>

To <dfn>remove a CSS rule</dfn> from a CSS rule list <var>list</var> at index <var>index</var>, follow these steps:
<ol>
 <li>Set <var>length</var> to the number of items in <var>list</var>.
 <li>If <var>index</var> is greater than or equal to <var>length</var>, then <a>throw</a>
 an {{IndexSizeError}} exception.
 <li>Set <var>old rule</var> to the <var>index</var>th item in <var>list</var>.
 <li>If <var>old rule</var> is an <code>@namespace</code> at-rule, and <var>list</var> contains anything other than
 <code>@import</code> at-rules, and <code>@namespace</code> at-rules,
 <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception.
 <li>Remove rule <var>old rule</var> from <var>list</var> at the zero-indexed position <var>index</var>.
 <li>Set <var>old rule</var>'s <a for=CSSRule>parent CSS rule</a> and
 <a for=CSSRule>parent CSS style sheet</a> to null.
</ol>


### The {{CSSRuleList}} Interface ### {#the-cssrulelist-interface}

The {{CSSRuleList}} interface represents an ordered collection of CSS style rules.

<pre class=idl>
[ArrayClass]
interface CSSRuleList {
  getter CSSRule? item(unsigned long index);
  readonly attribute unsigned long length;
};
</pre>

The object's <a>supported property indices</a> are the numbers in the range zero to one less than the number of
{{CSSRule}} objects represented by the collection. If there are no such {{CSSRule}} objects, then there are no
<a>supported property indices</a>.

The <dfn method for=CSSRuleList>item(<var>index</var>)</dfn> method must return the <var>index</var>th {{CSSRule}}
object in the collection. If there is no <var>index</var>th object in the collection, then the method must return null.

The <dfn attribute for=CSSRuleList>length</dfn> attribute must return the number of {{CSSRule}} objects represented by the
collection.

### The {{CSSRule}} Interface ### {#the-cssrule-interface}

The {{CSSRule}} interface represents an abstract, base CSS style rule. Each
distinct CSS style rule type is represented by a distinct interface that
inherits from this interface.

<pre class=idl>
interface CSSRule {
  const unsigned short STYLE_RULE = 1;
  const unsigned short CHARSET_RULE = 2; // historical
  const unsigned short IMPORT_RULE = 3;
  const unsigned short MEDIA_RULE = 4;
  const unsigned short FONT_FACE_RULE = 5;
  const unsigned short PAGE_RULE = 6;
  const unsigned short MARGIN_RULE = 9;
  const unsigned short NAMESPACE_RULE = 10;
  readonly attribute unsigned short type;
  attribute DOMString cssText;
  readonly attribute CSSRule? parentRule;
  readonly attribute CSSStyleSheet? parentStyleSheet;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=CSSRule>type</dfn> attribute must return the CSS rule type, as follows:

<dl class=switch>
 <dt>If the object is a {{CSSStyleRule}}
 <dd>Return <dfn const for=CSSRule>STYLE_RULE</dfn> (numeric value 1).
 <dt>If the object is a {{CSSImportRule}}
 <dd>Return <dfn const for=CSSRule>IMPORT_RULE</dfn> (numeric value 3).
 <dt>If the object is a {{CSSMediaRule}}
 <dd>Return <dfn const for=CSSRule>MEDIA_RULE</dfn> (numeric value 4).
 <dt>If the object is a {{CSSFontFaceRule}}
 <dd>Return <dfn const for=CSSRule>FONT_FACE_RULE</dfn> (numeric value 5).
 <dt>If the object is a {{CSSPageRule}}
 <dd>Return <dfn const for=CSSRule>PAGE_RULE</dfn> (numeric value 6).
 <dt>If the object is a {{CSSMarginRule}}
 <dd>Return <dfn const for=CSSRule>MARGIN_RULE</dfn> (numeric value 9).
 <dt>If the object is a {{CSSNamespaceRule}}
 <dd>Return <dfn const for=CSSRule>NAMESPACE_RULE</dfn> (numeric value 10).
 <dt>Otherwise
 <dd>Return a value defined on the <a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/spec/cssom-constants">CSSOM Constants</a> wiki page.
</dl>

Note: The value 0, formerly known as <code>UNKNOWN_RULE</code>, is made
obsolete by this specification. This value will not be re-allocated in the future and will remain reserved.

The <dfn attribute for=CSSRule>cssText</dfn> attribute must return a <a lt="serialize a CSS rule">serialization</a> of the
<a for=/>CSS rule</a>.
On setting the {{CSSRule/cssText}} attribute must do nothing.

The <dfn attribute for=CSSRule>parentRule</dfn> attribute must return the <a for=CSSRule>parent CSS
rule</a>.

Note: For example, <code>@media</code> can enclose a rule, in which case {{CSSRule/parentRule}} would
be non-null; in cases where there is no enclosing rule, {{CSSRule/parentRule}} will be null.

The <dfn attribute for=CSSRule>parentStyleSheet</dfn> attribute must return the
<a for=CSSRule>parent CSS style sheet</a>.

Note: The only circumstance where null is returned when a rule has been <a lt="remove a CSS rule">removed</a>.

Note: Removing a <code>Node</code> that implements the <code>LinkStyle</code> interface from a
{{Document}} instance does not (by itself) cause the <code>CSSStyleSheet</code> referenced by a <code>CSSRule</code> to be
unreachable.


### The {{CSSStyleRule}} Interface ### {#the-cssstylerule-interface}

The <code>CSSStyleRule</code> interface represents a style rule.

<pre class=idl>
interface CSSStyleRule : CSSRule {
  attribute DOMString selectorText;
  [SameObject, PutForwards=cssText] readonly attribute CSSStyleDeclaration style;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=CSSStyleRule>selectorText</dfn> attribute, on getting, must return the result of
<a lt="serialize a group of selectors">serializing</a> the associated <a>group of selectors</a>.
On setting the {{CSSStyleRule/selectorText}} attribute these steps must be run:
<ol>
 <li>Run the <a>parse a group of selectors</a> algorithm on the given value.
 <li>If the algorithm returns a non-null value replace the associated <a>group of selectors</a> with the returned value.
 <li>Otherwise, if the algorithm returns a null value, do nothing.
</ol>

The <dfn attribute for=CSSStyleRule>style</dfn> attribute must return a <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> object for the style rule, with the
following properties:
<dl>
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">readonly flag</a>
 <dd>Unset.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a>
 <dd>The declared declarations in the rule, in <a>specified order</a>.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">parent CSS rule</a>
 <dd>The <a>context object</a>.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">owner node</a>
 <dd>Null.
</dl>

The <dfn id=concept-declarations-specified-order>specified order</dfn> for declarations is the same as specified, but with shorthand properties
expanded into their longhand properties, in canonical order. If a property is specified more than once (after shorthand expansion), only the
one with greatest cascading order must be represented, at the same relative position as it was specified. [[!CSS3CASCADE]]


### The {{CSSImportRule}} Interface ### {#the-cssimportrule-interface}

The <code>CSSImportRule</code> interface represents an <code>@import</code> at-rule.

<pre class=idl>
interface CSSImportRule : CSSRule {
  readonly attribute DOMString href;
  [SameObject, PutForwards=mediaText] readonly attribute MediaList media;
  [SameObject] readonly attribute CSSStyleSheet styleSheet;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=CSSImportRule>href</dfn> attribute must return the <a for="/">URL</a> specified by
the <code>@import</code> at-rule.

Note: To get the resolved <a for="/">URL</a> use the {{StyleSheet/href}}
attribute of the associated <a>CSS style sheet</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=CSSImportRule>media</dfn> attribute must return the value of the {{StyleSheet/media}}
attribute of the associated <a>CSS style sheet</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=CSSImportRule>styleSheet</dfn> attribute must return the associated <a>CSS style sheet</a>.

Note: If loading of the style sheet fails its <a for=CSSStyleSheet>CSS rules</a>
list is simply empty, i.e., an <code>@import</code> at-rule always has an associated <a>CSS style sheet</a>.


### The {{CSSGroupingRule}} Interface ### {#the-cssgroupingrule-interface}

The <code>CSSGroupingRule</code> interface represents an at-rule that contains other rules nested inside itself.

<pre class=idl>
interface CSSGroupingRule : CSSRule {
  [SameObject] readonly attribute CSSRuleList cssRules;
  unsigned long insertRule(DOMString rule, unsigned long index);
  void deleteRule(unsigned long index);
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=CSSGroupingRule>cssRules</dfn> attribute must return a <code>CSSRuleList</code> object for the
<a for=CSSRule>child CSS rules</a>.

The <dfn method for=CSSGroupingRule>insertRule(<var>rule</var>, <var>index</var>)</dfn> method must return the result of
invoking <a>insert a CSS rule</a> <var>rule</var> into the <a for=CSSRule>child CSS rules</a> at
<var>index</var>.

The <dfn method for=CSSGroupingRule>deleteRule(<var>index</var>)</dfn> method must <a>remove a CSS rule</a> from the
<a for=CSSRule>child CSS rules</a> at <var>index</var>.


### The {{CSSMediaRule}} Interface ### {#the-cssmediarule-interface}

The <code>CSSMediaRule</code> interface represents an <code>@media</code> at-rule.

<pre class=idl>
interface CSSMediaRule : CSSGroupingRule {
  [SameObject, PutForwards=mediaText] readonly attribute MediaList media;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=CSSGroupingRule>media</dfn> attribute must return a <code>MediaList</code> object for the list of media queries specified
with the <code>@media</code> at-rule.


### The {{CSSPageRule}} Interface ### {#the-csspagerule-interface}

The <code>CSSPageRule</code> interface represents an <code>@page</code> at-rule.

Issue: Need to define the rules for
<dfn>parse a list of CSS page selectors</dfn> and
<dfn>serialize a list of CSS page selectors</dfn>.

<pre class=idl>
interface CSSPageRule : CSSGroupingRule {
           attribute DOMString selectorText;
  [SameObject, PutForwards=cssText] readonly attribute CSSStyleDeclaration style;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=CSSGroupingRule>selectorText</dfn> attribute, on getting, must return the result of
<a lt="serialize a list of CSS page selectors">serializing</a> the associated <a>list of CSS page selectors</a>.
On setting the {{CSSPageRule/selectorText}} attribute  these steps must be run:
<ol>
 <li>Run the <a>parse a list of CSS page selectors</a> algorithm on the given value.
 <li>If the algorithm returns a non-null value replace the associated <a>list of CSS page selectors</a> with the returned value.
 <li>Otherwise, if the algorithm returns a null value, do nothing.
</ol>

The <dfn attribute for=CSSGroupingRule>style</dfn> attribute must return a <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> object for the
<code>@page</code> at-rule, with the following properties:
<dl>
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">readonly flag</a>
 <dd>Unset.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a>
 <dd>The declared declarations in the rule, in <a>specified order</a>.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">parent CSS rule</a>
 <dd>The <a>context object</a>.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">owner node</a>
 <dd>Null.
</dl>


### The {{CSSMarginRule}} Interface ### {#the-cssmarginrule-interface}

The <code>CSSMarginRule</code> interface represents a margin at-rule (e.g. <code>@top-left</code>) in an <code>@page</code> at-rule.
[[!CSS3PAGE]]

<pre class=idl>
interface CSSMarginRule : CSSRule {
  readonly attribute DOMString name;
  [SameObject, PutForwards=cssText] readonly attribute CSSStyleDeclaration style;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=CSSMarginRule>name</dfn> attribute must return the name of the margin at-rule. The <code>@</code> character is not
included in the name. [[!CSS3SYN]]

The <dfn attribute for=CSSMarginRule>style</dfn> attribute must return a <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> object for the
margin at-rule, with the following properties:
<dl>
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">readonly flag</a>
 <dd>Unset.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a>
 <dd>The declared declarations in the rule, in <a>specified order</a>.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">parent CSS rule</a>
 <dd>The <a>context object</a>.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">owner node</a>
 <dd>Null.
</dl>


### The {{CSSNamespaceRule}} Interface ### {#the-cssnamespacerule-interface}

The <code>CSSNamespaceRule</code> interface represents an <code>@namespace</code> at-rule.

<pre class=idl>
interface CSSNamespaceRule : CSSRule {
  readonly attribute DOMString namespaceURI;
  readonly attribute DOMString prefix;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=CSSNamespaceRule>namespaceURI</dfn> attribute must return the namespace of the
<code>@namespace</code> at-rule.

The <dfn attribute for=CSSNamespaceRule>prefix</dfn> attribute must return the prefix of the <code>@namespace</code> at-rule or the
empty string if there is no prefix.


CSS Declarations {#css-declarations}
------------------------------------

A <dfn>CSS declaration</dfn> is an abstract concept that is not exposed as an object in the DOM. A <a>CSS declaration</a> has the following associated
properties:

<dl>
 <dt><dfn for="CSS declaration">property name</dfn>
 <dd>The property name of the declaration.
 <dt><dfn for="CSS declaration">value</dfn>
 <dd>The value of the declaration represented as a list of component values.
 <dt><dfn for="CSS declaration">important flag</dfn>
 <dd>Either set or unset. Can be changed.
 <dt><dfn for="CSS declaration">case-sensitive flag</dfn>
 <dd>Set if the <a for="CSS declaration">property name</a> is defined to be case-sensitive according to its specification,
 otherwise unset.
</dl>

CSS Declaration Blocks {#css-declaration-blocks}
------------------------------------------------

A <dfn>CSS declaration block</dfn> is an ordered collection of CSS
properties with their associated values, also named <a>CSS declarations</a>. In
the DOM a <a>CSS declaration block</a> is a
<code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> object. A
<a>CSS declaration block</a> has the following associated properties:

<dl dfn-for="CSSStyleDeclaration">
 <dt><dfn>readonly flag</dfn>
 <dd>Unset if the object can be manipulated. Set if it can not be
 manipulated. Unless otherwise stated it is unset.

 <dt><dfn>declarations</dfn>
 <dd>The <a>CSS declarations</a> associated with the object.

 <dt><dfn>parent CSS rule</dfn>
 <dd>The <a for=/>CSS rule</a> that the <a>CSS declaration block</a> is associated with, if any, or null otherwise.

 <dt><dfn>owner node</dfn>
 <dd>The {{Element}} that the <a>CSS declaration block</a> is associated with, if any, or
 null otherwise.
</dl>

To <dfn>parse a CSS declaration block</dfn> from a string <var>string</var>, follow these steps:

<ol>
 <li>Let <var>declarations</var> be the return value of invoking <a>parse a list of declarations</a> with <var>string</var>.
 <li>Let <var>parsed declarations</var> be a new empty list.
 <li>For each item <var>declaration</var> in <var>declarations</var>, follow these substeps:
  <ol>
   <li>Let <var>parsed declaration</var> be the result of parsing <var>declaration</var> according to the appropriate CSS specifications, dropping parts that
   are said to be ignored. If the whole declaration is dropped, let <var>parsed declaration</var> be null.
   <li>If <var>parsed declaration</var> is not null, append it to <var>parsed declarations</var>.
  </ol>
 <li>Return <var>parsed declarations</var>.
</ol>

To <dfn>serialize a CSS declaration</dfn> with property name <var>property</var>, value <var>value</var> and optionally an <i>important</i> flag set, follow
these steps:

<ol>
 <li>Let <var>s</var> be the empty string.
 <li>Append <var>property</var> to <var>s</var>.
 <li>Append "<code>: </code>" (U+003A U+0020) to <var>s</var>.
 <li>Append <var>value</var> to <var>s</var>.
 <li>If the <i>important</i> flag is set, append "<code> !important</code>" (U+0020 U+0021 U+0069 U+006D U+0070 U+006F U+0072 U+0074 U+0061 U+006E
 U+0074) to <var>s</var>.
 <li>Append "<code>;</code>" (U+003B) to <var>s</var>.
 <li>Return <var>s</var>.
</ol>

To <dfn>serialize a CSS declaration block</dfn> <var>declaration block</var> means to run the steps below:

<ol>
 <li>Let <var>list</var> be an empty array.
 <li>Let <var>already serialized</var> be an empty array.
 <li><i>Declaration loop</i>: For each <a>CSS declaration</a> <var>declaration</var> in <var>declaration block</var>'s
 <a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a>, follow these substeps:
  <ol>
   <li>Let <var>property</var> be <var>declaration</var>'s <a for="CSS declaration">property name</a>.
   <li>If <var>property</var> is in <var>already serialized</var>, continue with the steps labeled <i>declaration loop</i>.
   <li>If <var>property</var> maps to one or more shorthand properties, let <var>shorthands</var> be an array of those shorthand properties, in
   <a>preferred order</a>, and follow these substeps:
    <ol>
     <li>Let <var>longhands</var> be an array consisting of all <a>CSS declarations</a> in <var>declaration block</var>'s
     <a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a> that that are not in <var>already serialized</var> and have a
     <a for="CSS declaration">property name</a> that
     maps to one of the shorthand properties in <var>shorthands</var>.
     <li><i>Shorthand loop</i>: For each <var>shorthand</var> in <var>shorthands</var>, follow these substeps:
      <ol>
       <li>If all properties that map to <var>shorthand</var> are not present in <var>longhands</var>, continue with the steps labeled <i>shorthand loop</i>.
       <li>Let <var>current longhands</var> be an empty array.
       <li>Append all <a>CSS declarations</a> in <var>longhands</var> have a
       <a for="CSS declaration">property name</a> that maps to <var>shorthand</var> to <var>current longhands</var>.
       <li>If there is one or more <a>CSS declarations</a> in <var>current longhands</var> have their
       <a for="CSS declaration">important flag</a> set and one or more with it unset, continue with
       the steps labeled <i>shorthand loop</i>.
       <li>Let <var>value</var> be the result of invoking <a>serialize a CSS value</a> of <var>current longhands</var>.
       <li>If <var>value</var> is the empty string, continue with the steps labeled <i>shorthand loop</i>.
       <li>Let <var>serialized declaration</var> be the result of invoking <a>serialize a CSS declaration</a> with property name
       <var>shorthand</var>, value <var>value</var>, and the <i>important</i> flag set if the <a>CSS declarations</a> in
       <var>current longhands</var> have their <a for="CSS declaration">important flag</a> set.
       <li>Append <var>serialized declaration</var> to <var>list</var>.
       <li>Append the property names of all items of <var>current longhands</var> to <var>already serialized</var>.
       <li>Remove the items present in <var>current longhands</var> from <var>longhands</var>.
      </ol>
    </ol>
   <li>If <var>property</var> is in <var>already serialized</var>, continue with the steps labeled <i>declaration loop</i>.
   <li>Let <var>value</var> be the result of invoking <a>serialize a CSS value</a> of <var>declaration</var>.
   <li>Let <var>serialized declaration</var> be the result of invoking <a>serialize a CSS declaration</a> with property name <var>property</var>, value
   <var>value</var>, and the <i>important</i> flag set if <var>declaration</var> has its <a for="CSS declaration">important
   flag</a> set.
   <li>Append <var>serialized declaration</var> to <var>list</var>.
   <li>Append <var>property</var> to <var>already serialized</var>.
  </ol>
 <li>Return <var>list</var> joined with "<code> </code>" (U+0020).
</ol>

Note: The serialization of an empty CSS declaration block is the empty string.

Note: The serialization of a non-empty CSS declaration block does not include any surrounding whitespace, i.e., no whitespace appears
before the first property name and no whitespace appears after the final semicolon delimiter that follows the last property value.

The <dfn id=concept-shorthands-preferred-order>preferred order</dfn> of a list of shorthand properties <var>shorthands</var> is as follows:

<ol>
 <li>Order <var>shorthands</var> lexicographically.
 <li>Move all items in <var>shorthands</var> that begin with "<code>-</code>" (U+002D) last in the list, retaining their relative order.
 <li>Move all items in <var>shorthands</var> that begin with "<code>-</code>" (U+002D) but do not begin with "<code>-webkit-</code>" last in the
 list, retaining their relative order.
 <li>Order <var>shorthands</var> by the number of longhand properties that map to it, with the greatest number first.
</ol>

### The {{CSSStyleDeclaration}} Interface ### {#the-cssstyledeclaration-interface}

The <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> interface represents a <a>CSS declaration block</a>, including its underlying state, where this
underlying state depends upon the source of the <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</Code> instance.

<pre class=idl>
interface CSSStyleDeclaration {
  [CEReactions] attribute DOMString cssText;
  readonly attribute unsigned long length;
  getter DOMString item(unsigned long index);
  DOMString getPropertyValue(DOMString property);
  DOMString getPropertyPriority(DOMString property);
  [CEReactions] void setProperty(DOMString property, [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] DOMString value, [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] optional DOMString priority = "");
  [CEReactions] void setPropertyValue(DOMString property, [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] DOMString value);
  [CEReactions] void setPropertyPriority(DOMString property, [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] DOMString priority);
  [CEReactions] DOMString removeProperty(DOMString property);
  readonly attribute CSSRule? parentRule;
  [CEReactions, TreatNullAs=EmptyString] attribute DOMString cssFloat;
};
</pre>

The object's <a>supported property indices</a> are the numbers in the range zero to one less than the number of
<a>CSS declarations</a> in the <a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a>. If there are no such
<a>CSS declarations</a>, then there are no <a>supported property indices</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=CSSStyleDeclaration>cssText</dfn> attribute must return the result of
<a lt="serialize a CSS declaration block">serializing</a> the <a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a>.
Setting the {{CSSStyleDeclaration/cssText}} attribute must run these steps:
<ol>
 <li>If the <a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">readonly flag</a> is set, <a>throw</a>

  <ol>
   <li>Let <var>list</var> be a new empty array.
   <li>For each longhand property <var>longhand</var> that <var>property</var> maps to, in canonical order, follow these substeps:

     name</a> of a <a>CSS declaration</a> in the <a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a>, let <var>declaration</var>
     be that <a>CSS declaration</a>, or null otherwise.
     <li>If <var>declaration</var> is null, return the empty string and terminate these steps.
     <li>Append the <var>declaration</var> to <var>list</var>.
    </ol>
   <li>Return the <a lt="serialize a CSS value">serialization</a> of <var>list</var> and terminate these steps.
  </ol>
 <li>If <var>property</var> is a <a>case-sensitive</a>
 match for a <a for="CSS declaration">property name</a> of a <a>CSS declaration</a> in the

 <a>serialize a CSS value</a> of that declaration and terminate these steps.
 <li>Return the empty string.
</ol>

The <dfn method for=CSSStyleDeclaration>getPropertyPriority(<var>property</var>)</dfn> method must run these steps:
<ol>
 <li>Let <var>property</var> be <var>property</var> <a>converted to ASCII lowercase</a>.

   declaration</a> in the <a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a> that has the
   <a for="CSS declaration">important flag</a> set, return the string "<code>important</code>".
  </ol>
 <li>Return the empty string.
</ol>
<div class=example>E.g. for <code>background-color:lime !IMPORTANT</code> the return
value would be "<code>important</code>".</div>

The <dfn method for=CSSStyleDeclaration>setProperty(<var>property</var>, <var>value</var>, <var>priority</var>)</dfn> method must run these steps:

 algorithm.
 <li>If <var>value</var> is the empty string, invoke {{CSSStyleDeclaration/removeProperty()}}

 <li>
  Let <var>component value list</var> be the result of <a lt="parse a CSS value">parsing</a> <var>value</var> for property <var>property</var>.

  Note: <var>value</var> can not include "<code>!important</code>".

 <li>If <var>component value list</var> is null terminate these steps.

CSS Values {#css-values}
------------------------


### Parsing CSS Values ### {#parsing-css-values}

To <dfn>parse a CSS value</dfn> <var>value</var> for a given
<var>property</var> means to follow these steps:

<ol>
 <li>Let <var>list</var> be the value returned by invoking <a>parse a list of component values</a> from <var>value</var>.
 <li>Match <var>list</var> against the grammar for the property <var>property</var> in the CSS specification.
 <li>If the above step failed, return null.
 <li>Return <var>list</var>.
</ol>

Note: "<code>!important</code>" declarations are not
part of the property value space and will therefore cause
<a>parse a CSS value</a> to return null.


### Serializing CSS Values ### {#serializing-css-values}

<!-- based on http://damowmow.com/playground/canon.txt -->

To <dfn>serialize a CSS value</dfn> of a <a>CSS declaration</a> <var>declaration</var> or a list of longhand <a lt="CSS declaration">CSS
declarations</a> <var>list</var>, follow these rules:

<ol>
 <li>If this algorithm is invoked with a list <var>list</var>, follow these substeps:
  <ol>
   <li>Let <var>shorthand</var> be the shorthand property that exactly maps to all the longhand properties in <var>list</var>. If there are multiple such
   shorthand properties, use the first in <a>preferred order</a>.
   <li>If <var>shorthand</var> cannot represent the values of <var>list</var> in its grammar, return the empty string and terminate these steps.
   <li>Let <var>trimmed list</var> be a new empty array.
   <li>For each <a>CSS declaration</a> <var>declaration</var> in <var>list</var>, if <var>declaration</var>'s
   <a for="CSS declaration">value</a> is not the initial value, or if
   <var>declaration</var> is a required component of the <var>shorthand</var> property, append <var>declaration</var> to <var>trimmed list</var>.
   <li>If <var>trimmed list</var> is empty, append the value of the first item in <var>list</var> to <var>trimmed list</var>.
   <li>Let <var>values</var> be a new empty array.
   <li>For each <a>CSS declaration</a> <var>declaration</var> in <var>trimmed list</var>, invoke <a>serialize a CSS value</a> of
   <var>declaration</var>, and append the result to <var>values</var>.
   <li>Return the result of joining <var>values</var> as appropriate according to the grammar of <var>shorthand</var> and terminate these steps.
  </ol>
 <li>Let <var>values</var> be a new empty array.
 <li>Append the result of invoking <a>serialize a CSS component value</a> of <var>declaration</var>'s
 <a for="CSS declaration">value</a> to <var>values</var>.
 <li>If the grammar of the <a for="CSS declaration">property name</a> of <var>declaration</var> is defined to be
 whitespace-separated, return the result of invoking <a>serialize a whitespace-separated list</a> of <var>values</var> and terminate these steps.
 <li>If the grammar of the <a for="CSS declaration">property name</a> of <var>declaration</var> is defined to be comma-separated,
 return the result of invoking <a>serialize a comma-separated list</a> of <var>values</var>.
</ol>

To
<dfn>serialize a CSS component value</dfn>
depends on the component, as follows:

<dl class="switch">
 <dt>keyword
 <dd>The keyword
 <a>converted to ASCII lowercase</a>.

 <dt>&lt;angle>
 <dd>The &lt;number> component serialized as per &lt;number> followed by the unit in canonical form as defined in its respective specification.

 <dt>&lt;color>
 <dd>
 If &lt;color&gt; is a component of a resolved or computed value, then
 return the color using the <code>rgb()</code> or <code>rgba()</code> functional
 notation as follows:
 <ol>
 <li>If the alpha component of the color is equal to one, then return the serialization of the
 <code>rgb()</code> functional equivalent of the opaque color.
 <li>If the alpha component of the color is not equal to one, then return the serialization of the
 <code>rgba()</code> functional equivalent of the non-opaque color.
 </ol>
 The serialization of the <code>rgb()</code> functional equivalent is the concatenation of the following:
 <ol>
 <li>The string "<code>rgb(</code>".
 <li>The shortest base-ten integer serialization of the color's red component.
 <li>The string "<code>, </code>".
 <li>The shortest base-ten serialization of the color's green component.
 <li>The string "<code>, </code>".
 <li>The shortest base-ten serialization of the color's blue component.
 <li>The string "<code>)</code>".
 </ol>
 The serialization of the <code>rgba()</code> functional equivalent is the concatenation of the following:
 <ol>
 <li>The string "<code>rgba(</code>".
 <li>The shortest base-ten serialization of the color's red component.
 <li>The string "<code>, </code>".
 <li>The shortest base-ten serialization of the color's green component.
 <li>The string "<code>, </code>".
 <li>The shortest base-ten serialization of the color's blue component.
 <li>The string "<code>, </code>".
 <li>The serialization of the color's alpha component as an &lt;alphavalue>.
 <li>The string "<code>)</code>".
 </ol>

 In the above rules, the string "<code>, </code>" denotes a COMMA (U+002C) followed by a single SPACE (U+0020).

 If &lt;color&gt; is a component of a specified value, then
 return the color as follows:
 <ol>
 <li>If the color was explicitly specified by the author, then return the original, author specified color value.
 <li>Otherwise, return the value that would be returned if the color were a component of a computed value.
 </ol>

 Issue: Should author specified values be normalized for case? Or should original case be preserved?

 <dt>&lt;alphavalue>
 <dd>
  If the value is internally represented as an integer between 0 and 255 inclusive (i.e. 8-bit unsigned integer),
  follow these steps:

  <ol>
   <li>Let <var>alpha</var> be the given integer.
   <li>If there exists an integer between 0 and 100 inclusive that,
   when multiplied with 2.55 and rounded to the closest integer (rounding up if two values are equally close), equals <var>alpha</var>,
   let <var>rounded</var> be that integer divided by 100.
   <li>Otherwise, let <var>rounded</var> be <var>alpha</var> divided by 0.255 and rounded to the closest integer (rounding up if two values are equally close),
   divided by 1000.
   <li>Return the result of serializing <var>rounded</var> as a &lt;number>.
  </ol>

  Otherwise, return the result of serializing the given value as a &lt;number>.

 <dt>&lt;counter>
 <dd>
  The return value of the following algorithm:
  <ol>
   <li>Let <var>s</var> be the empty string.
   <li>If &lt;counter> has three CSS component values append the string
   "<code>counters(</code>" to <var>s</var>.
   <li>If &lt;counter> has two CSS component values append the string
   "<code>counter(</code>" to <var>s</var>.
   <li>Let <var>list</var> be a list of CSS component values belonging to &lt;counter>, omitting the last CSS component value if it is "decimal".
   <li>Let each item in <var>list</var> be the result of invoking <a>serialize a CSS component value</a> on that item.
   <li>Append the result of invoking <a>serialize a comma-separated list</a> on <var>list</var> to <var>s</var>.
   <li>Append "<code>)</code>" (U+0029) to <var>s</var>.
   <li>Return <var>s</var>.
  </ol>


 <dt>&lt;frequency>
 <dd>The frequency in hertz serialized as per &lt;number> followed by
 the literal string "<code>hz</code>".

 <dt>&lt;identifier>
 <dd>The identifier
 <a lt="serialize an identifier">serialized as an identifier</a>.

 <dt>&lt;integer>
 <dd>A base-ten integer using digits 0-9 (U+0030 to U+0039) in the
 shortest form possible, preceded by "<code>-</code>" (U+002D) if it is
 negative.

 <dt>&lt;length>
 <dd>
  A length of zero is represented by the literal string
  "<code>0px</code>".

  Absolute lengths: the number of millimeters serialized as per
  &lt;number> followed by the literal string "<code>mm</code>".

  Issue: Rumor has it absolute lengths will become relative
  lengths. Centimeters would be compatible with &lt;resolution>...

  Relative lengths: the &lt;number> component serialized as per
  &lt;number> followed by the unit in its canonical form as defined in its
  respective specification.


 <dt>&lt;number>
 <dd>
  A base-ten number using digits 0-9 (U+0030 to U+0039) in the shortest form possible,
  using "<code>.</code>" to separate decimals (if any),
  rounding the value if necessary to not produce more than 6 decimals,
  preceded by "<code>-</code>" (U+002D) if it is negative.

  Note: scientific notation is not used.

 <dt>&lt;percentage>
 <dd>The &lt;number> component serialized as per &lt;number> followed
 by the literal string "<code>%</code>" (U+0025).

 <dt>&lt;resolution>
 <dd>The resolution in dots per CSS pixel serialized as per
 &lt;number> followed by the literal string "<code>dppx</code>".

 <dt>&lt;shape>
 <dd>
  The return value of the following algorithm:
  <ol>
   <li>Let <var>s</var> be the string "<code>rect(</code>".
   <li>Let <var>list</var> be a list of the CSS component values belonging to &lt;shape>.
   <li>Let each item in <var>list</var> be the result of invoking <a>serialize a CSS component value</a> of that item.
   <li>Append the result of invoking <a>serialize a comma-separated list</a> on <var>list</var> to <var>s</var>.

   <li>Return <var>s</var>.
  </ol>


 <dt>&lt;string>
 <dt>&lt;family-name>
 <dt>&lt;specific-voice>
 <dd>The string
 <a lt="serialize a string">serialized as a string</a>.

 <dt>&lt;time>
 <dd>The time in seconds serialized as per &lt;number> followed by
 the literal string "<code>s</code>".

 <dt>&lt;uri>
 <dd>The <a>absolute URL</a>
 <a lt="serialize a URL">serialized as URL</a>.
</dl>


 &lt;absolute-size>,
 &lt;border-width>,
 &lt;border-style>,
 &lt;bottom>,
 &lt;generic-family>,
 &lt;generic-voice>,
 &lt;left>,
 &lt;margin-width>,
 &lt;padding-width>,
 &lt;relative-size>,
 &lt;right>, and
 &lt;top>,
 are considered macros by this specification. They all represent instances
 of components outlined above.

Issue: One idea is that we can remove this section somewhere in
the CSS3/CSS4 timeline by moving the above definitions to the drafts that
define the CSS components.


#### Examples #### {#serializing-css-values-examples}

Here are some examples of before and after results on specified values.
The before column could be what the author wrote in a style sheet, while
the after column shows what querying the DOM would return.

<div class="example">
 <table class="complex data">
  <thead>
   <tr><th>Before<th>After
  <tbody>
   <tr><td><code>background: none</code><td><code>background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)</code>
   <tr><td><code>outline: none</code><td><code>outline: invert</code>
   <tr><td><code>border: none</code><td><code>border: medium</code>
   <tr><td><code>list-style: none</code><td><code>list-style: disc</code>
   <tr><td><code>margin: 0 1px 1px 1px</code><td><code>margin: 0px 1px 1px</code>
   <tr><td><code>azimuth: behind left</code><td><code>azimuth: 220deg</code>
   <tr><td><code>font-family: a, 'b"', serif</code><td><code>font-family: "a", "b\"", serif</code>
   <tr><td><code>content: url('h)i') '\[\]'</code><td><code>content: url("h)i") "[]"</code>
   <tr><td><code>azimuth: leftwards</code><td><code>azimuth: leftwards</code>
   <tr><td><code>color: rgb(18, 52, 86)</code><td><code>color: #123456</code>
   <tr><td><code>color: rgba(000001, 0, 0, 1)</code><td><code>color: #000000</code>
 </table>

 Issue: Some of these need to be updated per the new rules.

DOM Access to CSS Declaration Blocks {#dom-access-to-css-declaration-blocks}
============================================================================


The {{ElementCSSInlineStyle}} Interface {#the-elementcssinlinestyle-interface}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The <code>ElementCSSInlineStyle</code> interface provides access to inline style properties of an element.

<pre class=idl>
[NoInterfaceObject]
interface ElementCSSInlineStyle {
  [SameObject, PutForwards=cssText] readonly attribute CSSStyleDeclaration style;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=ElementCSSInlineStyle>style</dfn> attribute must return a live <a>CSS declaration block</a> with the following
properties:
<dl>
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">readonly flag</a>
 <dd>Unset.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a>
 <dd>The result of <a lt="Parse a CSS declaration block">parsing</a> the <code>style</code> content attribute, in
 <a>specified order</a>. If the <code>style</code> content attribute is absent, the object represents an
 empty list of <a>CSS declarations</a>. Mutating the <a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a>
 must set the <code>style</code> content attribute on the <a>context object</a> to the
 <a lt="serialize a CSS declaration block">serialization</a> of the <a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a>. If the
 <code>style</code> content attribute is set, changed or removed, the <a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a> must be
 updated as appropriate.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">parent CSS rule</a>
 <dd>Null.
 <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">owner node</a>
 <dd>The <a>context object</a>.
</dl>

If the user agent supports HTML, the following IDL applies: [[HTML]]

<pre class=idl>
HTMLElement implements ElementCSSInlineStyle;
</pre>

If the user agent supports SVG, the following IDL applies: [[SVG]]

<pre class=idl>
SVGElement implements ElementCSSInlineStyle;
</pre>


Extensions to the {{Window}} Interface {#extensions-to-the-window-interface}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<pre class=idl>
partial interface Window {
  [NewObject] CSSStyleDeclaration getComputedStyle(Element elt, optional DOMString? pseudoElt);
};
</pre>

The <dfn method for=Window>getComputedStyle(<var>elt</var>, <var>pseudoElt</var>)</dfn> method must run these
steps:
<ol>
 <li>Let <var>doc</var> be the
 {{Document}}
 associated with the <code>Window</code> object on
 which the method was invoked.
 <li>Let <var>obj</var> be <var>elt</var>.
 <li>If <var>pseudoElt</var> is as an
 <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for
 either ':before' or '::before' let
 <var>obj</var> be the ''::before'' pseudo-element of
 <var>elt</var>.
 <li>If <var>pseudoElt</var> is as an
 <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for
 either ':after' or '::after' let
 <var>obj</var> be the ''::after'' pseudo-element of
 <var>elt</var>.
 <li>
  Return a live <a>CSS declaration block</a> with the following properties:
  <dl>
   <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">readonly flag</a>
   <dd>Set.
   <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">declarations</a>
   <dd>All longhand properties that are <a lt="supported CSS property">supported CSS properties</a>, in lexicographical order, with the value being
   the <a>resolved value</a> computed for <var>obj</var> using the style rules associated with <var>doc</var>.

   Note: This means that even if <var>obj</var> is in a different document (e.g. one fetched via <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>) it will still use
   the style rules associated with the document that is associated with the global object on which
   {{Window/getComputedStyle()}} was invoked to compute the <a>CSS declaration block</a>.

   <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">parent CSS rule</a>
   <dd>Null.
   <dt><a for="CSSStyleDeclaration">owner node</a>
   <dd><var>obj</var>.
  </dl>

</ol>

<p class=warning>The {{Window/getComputedStyle()}} method exposes information from <a lt="CSS style sheet">CSS style
sheets</a> with the <a>origin-clean flag</a> unset.


Utility APIs {#utility-apis}
============================

The <code>CSS.escape()</code> Method {#the-css.escape()-method}
------------------------------------------------------

The <code>CSS</code> interface holds useful CSS-related functions that do not belong elsewhere.

<pre class=idl>
interface CSS {
  static DOMString escape(DOMString ident);
};
</pre>

The <dfn method for=CSS>escape(<var>ident</var>)</dfn> method must return the result of invoking <a>serialize an identifier</a> of
<var>ident</var>.

<div class=example>
 For example, to serialize a string for use as part of a selector, the {{CSS/escape()}} method can be used:
 <pre>var element = document.querySelector('#' + CSS.escape(id) + ' > img');</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
 The {{CSS/escape()}} method can also be used for escaping strings, although it escapes characters that don't strictly need to be
 escaped:
 <pre>var element = document.querySelector('a[href="#' + CSS.escape(fragment) + '"]');</pre>
</div>

Specifications that define static functions on the {{CSS}} interface and want to
store some state should store the state on the <a spec=html>current global
object</a>'s <a spec=html>associated <code>Document</code></a>.
<!-- https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/180 -->


Resolved Values {#resolved-values}
==================================

{{Window/getComputedStyle()}} was
historically defined to return the "computed value" of an element or
pseudo-element. However, the concept of "computed value" changed between
revisions of CSS while the implementation of
{{Window/getComputedStyle()}} had to
remain the same for compatibility with deployed scripts. To address this
issue this specification introduces the concept of a
<dfn>resolved value</dfn>.

The <a>resolved value</a> for a given property can be determined
as follows:

<dl class="switch">
 <dt>'line-height'
 <dd>The <a>resolved value</a> is the <a>used value</a>.

 <dt>'block-size'
 <dt>'height'
 <dt>'inline-size'
 <dt>'margin-block-end'
 <dt>'margin-block-start'
 <dt>'margin-bottom'
 <dt>'margin-inline-end'
 <dt>'margin-inline-start'
 <dt>'margin-left'
 <dt>'margin-right'
 <dt>'margin-top'
 <dt>'margin'
 <dt>'padding-block-end'
 <dt>'padding-block-start'
 <dt>'padding-bottom'
 <dt>'padding-inline-end'
 <dt>'padding-inline-start'
 <dt>'padding-left'
 <dt>'padding-right'
 <dt>'padding-top'
 <dt>'padding'
 <dt>'width'
 <dd>If the property applies to the element or pseudo-element and the <a>resolved value</a> of the
 'display' property is not ''display/none'' or ''display/contents'', then the <a>resolved value</a>
 is the <a>used value</a>. Otherwise the <a>resolved value</a> is the <a>computed value</a>.

 <dt>'bottom'
 <dt>'left'
 <dt>'offset-block-end'
 <dt>'offset-block-start'
 <dt>'offset-inline-end'
 <dt>'offset-inline-start'
 <dt>'right'
 <dt>'top'
 <dd>If the property applies to a positioned element and the <a>resolved value</a> of the 'display'
 property is not ''display/none'' or ''display/contents'', and the property is not over-constrained,
 then the <a>resolved value</a> is the <a>used value</a>. Otherwise the <a>resolved value</a> is the
 <a>computed value</a>.

 <dt>Any other property
 <dd>The <a>resolved value</a> is the <a>computed value</a>.
</dl>
