<p class="note">Implementers should note well that this specification is an ongoing effort to sort out
what has been widely implemented and deployed from <span data-anolis-ref class=informative>DOM2STYLE</span> as well as common extensions thereto, some details
of which are currently interoperable and others which are not currently interoperable. As this specification moves
forward, it is hoped that these differences will be resolved and an unambiguous and adequate consensus-based
specification will emerge.</p>

<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="toc">Table of Contents</h2>

<!--toc-->


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document formally specifies the core features of the CSS Object Model (CSSOM). Other documents in the CSSOM family of specifications
as well as other CSS related specifications define extensions to these core features.</p>

<p>The core features of the CSSOM are oriented towards providing basic capabilities to author-defined scripts to permit access to
and manipulation of style related state information and processes.</p>

<p>The features defined below are fundamentally based on prior specifications of the W3C DOM Working Group, primarily
<span data-anolis-ref class=informative>DOM2STYLE</span>. The purposes of the present document are (1) to improve on that prior work by providing
more technical specificity (so as to improve testability and interoperability), (2) to deprecate or remove certain less-widely implemented
features no longer considered to be essential in this context, and (3) to newly specify certain extensions that have been
or expected to be widely implemented.</p>

<!--<p>A full list of the changes to API signatures can be found in <a href="#changes-from-dom-2-style"><cite>Changes from DOM-2 Style</cite></a>.</p>-->


<h2>Conformance</h2>

<p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", <!--"SHALL", "SHALL
NOT",--> "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC2119. For readability, these words do
not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification.
<span data-anolis-ref>RFC2119</span>

<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms
(such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and
terminate these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the
key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the
algorithm.

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to
be performant.)

<p id="hardwareLimitations">User agents may impose
implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs,
e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running
out of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations. <!--fingerprint-->

<p>When a method or an attribute is said to call another method or attribute, the user agent must invoke its internal API for that attribute or method so that
e.g. the author can't change the behavior by overriding attributes or methods with custom properties or functions in ECMAScript.

<p>Unless otherwise stated, string comparisons are done in a
<span data-anolis-spec=dom>case-sensitive</span> manner.


<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>This specification employs certain terminology from the following documents:
<cite>DOM</cite>,
<cite>HTML</cite>,
<cite>CSS Syntax</cite>,
<cite>Encoding</cite>,
<cite>URL</cite>,
<cite>Fetch</cite>,
<cite>Associating Style Sheets with XML documents</cite>
and
<cite>XML</cite>.
<span data-anolis-ref>DOM</span>
<span data-anolis-ref>HTML</span>
<span data-anolis-ref>CSSSYNTAX</span>
<span data-anolis-ref>ENCODING</span>
<span data-anolis-ref>URL</span>
<span data-anolis-ref>FETCH</span>
<span data-anolis-ref>XMLSS</span>
<span data-anolis-ref>XML</span>

<p>When this specification talks about object
<code title><var>A</var></code> where <code title><var>A</var></code> is actually an interface, it generally means an object implementing interface
<code title><var>A</var></code>.</p>

<p>The terms <dfn>whitespace</dfn> and <dfn>ignored</dfn> are defined in CSS. <span data-anolis-ref>CSS</span>

<p>The terms <dfn>cascaded value</dfn>, <dfn>computed value</dfn> and <dfn>used value</dfn> are defined in CSS Cascade and Inheritance.
<span data-anolis-ref>CSSCASCADE</span>

<p>The terms <dfn>simple selector</dfn>, <dfn>sequence of simple selectors</dfn>, <dfn>universal selector</dfn> and <dfn>group of selectors</dfn> are defined in
Selectors. <span data-anolis-ref>SELECTORS</span>

<p>The term <dfn>list of CSS page selectors</dfn> refers to the comma-separated list of page selectors, as defined in CSS Paged Media Module.
<span data-anolis-ref>CSSPAGE</span>

<p>The terms <dfn>set</dfn> and <dfn>unset</dfn> to refer to the true and
false values of binary flags or variables, respectively. These terms are also used as verbs in which case they refer to
mutating some value to make it true or false, respectively.</p>

<p>The term <dfn>supported styling language</dfn> refers to CSS.

<p class=note>If another styling language becomes supported in user agents, this specification is expected to be updated as necessary.

<p>The term <dfn>supported CSS property</dfn> refers to a CSS property that the user agent implements, and that is defined to be a case-insensitive property in
the CSS specification. A <span>supported CSS property</span> must be in its lowercase form for the purpose of comparisons this specification.

<p>The term <dfn>author-defined CSS property</dfn> refers to <code title>var-*</code> properties as defined in CSS Custom Properties for Cascading Variables,
and are case-sensitive. <span data-anolis-ref>CSSVARIABLES</span>

<p>The terms <dfn>::before pseudo-element</dfn> and <dfn>::after pseudo-element</dfn> refer to the :before and :after pseudo-elements in CSS, except in this
specification the pseudo-elements are assumed to exist for all elements even if no box is generated for them. <span data-anolis-ref>CSS</span>

<p>The term <dfn>environment encoding</dfn> is defined in CSS Syntax Module. <span data-anolis-ref>CSSSYNTAX</span>

<p>The algorithm <dfn>get an encoding</dfn> is defined in the Encoding standard. <span data-anolis-ref>ENCODING</span>

<p>The term <dfn>document's character encoding</dfn> is defined in DOM. <span data-anolis-ref>DOM</span>

<h3>Common Serializing Idioms</h3>

<p>To <dfn>escape a character</dfn> means to create a string of
"<code title>\</code>" (U+005C), followed by the character.</p>

<p>To <dfn>escape a character as code point</dfn> means to create a
string of "<code title>\</code>" (U+005C), followed by the Unicode code point as
the smallest possible number of hexadecimal digits in the range 0-9 a-f
(U+0030 to U+0039 and U+0061 to U+0066) to represent the code point in
base 16, followed by a single SPACE (U+0020).</p>

<p>To <dfn>serialize an identifier</dfn> means to create a string represented
by the concatenation of, for each character of the identifier:</p>

<ul>
 <li>If the character is NULL (U+0000), then <span data-anolis-spec=dom title=concept-throw>throw</span> an
 <code data-anolis-spec=dom>InvalidCharacterError</code> exception and terminate these steps.</li>
 <li>If the character is in the range [\1-\1f] (U+0001 to U+001F) or is U+007F, then the character
 <span title="escape a character as code point">escaped as code point</span>.</li>
 <li>If the character is the first character and is in the range [0-9]
 (U+0030 to U+0039), then the character
 <span title="escape a character as code point">escaped as code point</span>.</li>
 <li>If the character is the second character and is in the range [0-9]
 (U+0030 to U+0039) and the first character is a "<code title>-</code>"
 (U+002D), then the character
 <span title="escape a character as code point">escaped as code point</span>.</li>
 <li>If the character is not handled by one of the above rules and is
 greater than or equal to U+0080, is "<code title>-</code>" (U+002D) or
 "<code title>_</code>" (U+005F), or is in one of the ranges [0-9] (U+0030 to
 U+0039), [A-Z] (U+0041 to U+005A), or [a-z] (U+0061 to U+007A), then the character
 itself.</li>
 <li>Otherwise, the <span title="escape a character">escaped</span>
 character.</li>
</ul>

<p>To <dfn>serialize a string</dfn> means to create a string represented
by '"' (U+0022), followed by the result of applying the rules
below to each character of the given string, followed by
'"' (U+0022):</p>

<ul>
 <li>If the character is NULL (U+0000), then <span data-anolis-spec=dom title=concept-throw>throw</span> an
 <code data-anolis-spec=dom>InvalidCharacterError</code> exception and terminate these steps.</li>
 <li>If the character is in the range [\1-\1f] (U+0001 to U+001F) or is U+007F, the character
 <span title="escape a character as code point">escaped as code point</span>.</li>
 <li>If the character is '"' (U+0022) or "<code title>\</code>"
 (U+005C), the <span title="escape a character">escaped</span> character.</li>
 <li>Otherwise, the character itself.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">"<code title>'</code>" (U+0027) is not escaped because strings
are always serialized with '"' (U+0022).</p>

<p>To <dfn>serialize a URL</dfn> means to create a string represented by
"<code title>url(</code>", followed by the
<span title="serialize a string">string escaped</span> value of the given
string, followed by "<code title>)</code>".</p>

<p>To <dfn>serialize a comma-separated list</dfn> concatenate all items of
the list in list order while separating them by "<code title>, </code>", i.e.,
COMMA (U+002C) followed by a single SPACE (U+0020).</p>

<p>To <dfn>serialize a whitespace-separated list</dfn> concatenate all
items of the list in list order while separating them by "<code title> </code>", i.e.,
a single SPACE (U+0020).</p>

<p class="note">When serializing a list according to the above rules,
extraneous whitespace is not inserted prior to the first item or subsequent to
the last item. Unless otherwise specified, an empty list is serialized as the
empty string.</p>


<h2>Media Queries</h2>

<p>Media queries are defined by the Media Queries specification. This
section defines various concepts around media queries, including their API
and serialization form.</p>

<!-- XXX ref -->


<h3>Parsing Media Queries</h3>

<p>To
<dfn>parse a media query list</dfn> for a
given string <var>s</var> into a media query list is defined in
the Media Queries specification. Return the list of one or more media
queries that the algorithm defined there gives.</p> <!-- XXX ref -->

<p class="note">A media query that ends up being "ignored" will turn
into "<code title>not all</code>".</p>

<p>To
<dfn>parse a media query</dfn> for a given string
<var>s</var> means to follow the
<span>parse a media query list</span> steps and return null if more
than one media query is returned or a media query if a
single media query is returned.</p>

<p class="note">Again, a media query that ends up being "ignored" will
turn into "<code title>not all</code>".</p>


<h3>Serializing Media Queries</h3>

<p>To
<dfn>serialize a media query list</dfn>
run these steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>If the media query list is empty return the empty string and
 terminate these steps.</p></li>

 <li><p><span title="serialize a media query">Serialize</span> each media query in the list of media queries, in the same order as they appear in the list of
 media queries, and then <span title="serialize a comma-separated list">serialize</span> the list.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To
<dfn>serialize a media query</dfn> let
<var>s</var> be the empty string, run the steps below, and
finally return <var>s</var>:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>If the media query is negated append "<code title>not</code>", followed
 by a single SPACE (U+0020), to <var>s</var>.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let <var>type</var> be the media type of the media query,
 <span title="serialize an identifier">escaped</span> and
 <span data-anolis-spec=dom>converted to ASCII lowercase</span>.</p></li>

 <li><p>If the media query does not contain media features append
 <var>type</var>, to <var>s</var>,
 then return <var>s</var> and terminate this algorithm.</p></li>

 <li><p>If <var>type</var> is not "<code title>all</code>" or if the
 media query is negated append <var>type</var>, followed by a
 single SPACE (U+0020), followed by "<code title>and</code>", followed by a single SPACE
 (U+0020), to <var>s</var>.</p></li>

 <li><p>Sort the media features in lexicographical order.</p></li>

 <li>
  <p>Then, for each media feature:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Append a "<code title>(</code>" (U+0028), followed by the media feature
   name, <span data-anolis-spec=dom>converted to ASCII lowercase</span>,
   to <var>s</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If a value is given append a "<code title>:</code>" (U+003A), followed
   by a single SPACE (U+0020), followed by the
   <span title="serialize a media feature value">serialized media feature value</span>,
   to <var>s</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Append a "<code title>)</code>" (U+0029) to
   <var>s</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If this is not the last media feature append a single SPACE (U+0020),
   followed by "<code title>and</code>", followed by a single SPACE (U+0020), to
   <var>s</var>.</p></li>
  </ol>
 </li>
</ol>

<div class="example">
 <p>Here are some examples of input (first column) and output (second
 column):</p>

 <table class="complex data">
  <thead>
   <tr><th>Input<th>Output
  <tbody>
   <tr>
    <td><pre>not screen and (min-WIDTH:5px) AND (max-width:40px)</pre>
    <td><pre>not screen and (max-width: 40px) and (min-width: 5px)</pre>
   <tr>
    <td><pre>all and (color) and (color)</pre>
    <td><pre>(color)</pre>
 </table>
</div>



<h4>Serializing Media Feature Values</h4>

<p class="issue">This should probably be done in terms of mapping it to
serializing CSS values as media features are defined in terms of CSS
values after all.</p>

<p>To <dfn>serialize a media feature value</dfn>
named <var>v</var> locate <var>v</var> in the first
column of the table below and use the serialization format described in
the second column:</p>

<table class="complex data">
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Media Feature
   <th>Serialization
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>'width'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'height'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'device-width'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'device-height'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'orientation'
   <td>
    <p>If the value is 'portrait': "<code title>portrait</code>".</p>
    <p>If the value is 'landscape': "<code title>landscape</code>".</p>
  <tr>
   <td>'aspect-ratio'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'device-aspect-ratio'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'color'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'color-index'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'monochrome'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'resolution'
   <td>...
  <tr>
   <td>'scan'
   <td>
    <p>If the value is 'progressive': "<code title>progressive</code>".</p>
    <p>If the value is 'interlace': "<code title>interlace</code>".</p>
  <tr>
   <td>'grid'
   <td>...
</table>

<p>Other specifications can extend this table and vendor-prefixed media
features can have custom serialization formats as well.</p>


<h3>Comparing Media Queries</h3>

<p>To
<dfn>compare media queries</dfn>
<var>m1</var> and <var>m2</var> means to
<span title="serialize a media query">serialize</span> them both and
return true if they are a
<span data-anolis-spec=dom>case-sensitive</span> match and false if they
are not.</p>


<h3>The <code title>MediaList</code> Interface</h3>

<!--
//
// All members defined since DOM-2 Style. The only differences are:
//
//   1. addition of stringifier qualifier on mediaText
//   2. addition of getter qualifier on item
//   3. removal of raises(DOMException) from {append,delete}Medium
//
-->

<p>An object that implements the <code>MediaList</code> interface has an associated <dfn>collection of media queries</dfn>.</p>

<pre class=idl>[ArrayClass]
interface <dfn>MediaList</dfn> {
  [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] stringifier attribute DOMString <span title=dom-MediaList-mediaText>mediaText</span>;
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title=dom-MediaList-length>length</span>;
  getter DOMString? <span title=dom-MediaList-item>item</span>(unsigned long index);
  void <span title=dom-MediaList-appendMedium>appendMedium</span>(DOMString medium);
  void <span title=dom-MediaList-deleteMedium>deleteMedium</span>(DOMString medium);
};</pre>

<p>The object's <span data-anolis-spec=webidl>supported property indices</span> are the numbers in the range zero to one less than the number of media queries
in the <span>collection of media queries</span> represented by the collection. If there are no such media queries, then there are no
<span data-anolis-spec=webidl>supported property indices</span>.

<p>To <dfn>create a <code>MediaList</code> object</dfn> with a string <var>text</var>, run the following steps:
<ol>
 <li><p>Create a new <code>MediaList</code> object.</p></li>
 <li><p>Set its <code title='dom-MediaList-mediaText'>mediaText</code> attribute to <var>text</var>.</p></li>
 <li><p>Return the newly created <code>MediaList</code> object.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-MediaList-mediaText><code>mediaText</code></dfn> attribute, on getting, must return a
<span title='serialize a media query list'>serialization</span> of the <span>collection of media queries</span>.</p>
<p>Setting the <code title=dom-MediaList-mediaText>mediaText</code> attribute must run these steps:
<ol>
 <li><p>Empty the <span>collection of media queries</span>.</p></li>
 <li><p>If the given value is the empty string terminate these steps.</p></li>
 <li><p>Append all the media queries as a result of <span title='parse a media query list'>parsing</span> the given
 value to the <span>collection of media queries</span>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-MediaList-item><code>item(<var>index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the media query in the <span>collection of media
queries</span> given by <var>index</var>, or null, if <var>index</var> is greater than or equal to the number of media queries in the
<span>collection of media queries</span>.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-MediaList-length><code>length</code></dfn> attribute must return the number of media queries in the <span>collection of media
queries</span>.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-MediaList-appendMedium><code>appendMedium(<var>medium</var>)</code></dfn> method must run these steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>m</var> be the result of <span title='parse a media query'>parsing</span> the given value.</p></li>
 <li><p>If <var>m</var> is null terminate these steps.</p></li>
 <li><p>If <span title='compare media queries'>comparing</span> <var>m</var> with any of the media queries in the
 <span>collection of media queries</span> returns true terminate these steps.</p></li>
 <li><p>Append <var>m</var> to the <span>collection of media queries</span>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-MediaList-deleteMedium><code>deleteMedium(<var>medium</var>)</code></dfn> method must run these steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>m</var> be the result of <span title='parse a media query'>parsing</span> the given value.</p></li>
 <li><p>If <var>m</var> is null terminate these steps.</p></li>
 <li><p>Remove any media query from the <span>collection of media queries</span> for which
 <span title='compare media queries'>comparing</span> the media query with <var>m</var> returns true.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Selectors</h2>

<p>Selectors are defined in the Selectors specification. This section
mainly defines how to serialize them.</p> <!-- XXX ref -->

<!-- XXX ref universal selector etc? some are in <span> some not -->


<h3>Parsing Selectors</h3>

<p>To
<dfn>parse a group of selectors</dfn>
means to parse the value using the <code title>selectors_group</code>
production defined in the Selectors specification and return either a
group of selectors if parsing did not fail or null if parsing did

<h3>CSS Style Sheets</h3>

<p>A <dfn>CSS style sheet</dfn> is an abstract concept that
represents a style sheet as defined by the CSS specification. In the CSSOM a
<span>CSS style sheet</span> is represented as a <code>CSSStyleSheet</code> object. A
<span>CSS style sheet</span> has a number of associated state items:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-style-sheet-type>type</dfn></dt>
 <dd><p>The literal string "<code title>text/css</code>".</p></dd>

 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-style-sheet-location>location</dfn></dt>
 <dd><p>Specified when created. The <span data-anolis-spec=url title=concept-absolute-url>absolute URL</span> of the first request of the
 <span>CSS style sheet</span> or null if the <span>CSS style sheet</span> was
 embedded. Does not change during the lifetime of the <span>CSS style sheet</span>.</p></dd>

 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-style-sheet-parent-css-style-sheet>parent CSS style sheet</dfn></dt>
 <dd><p>Specified when created. The <span>CSS style sheet</span> that is the parent of the
 <span>CSS style sheet</span> or null if there is no associated parent.</p></dd>

 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-node>owner node</dfn></dt>
 <dd><p>Specified when created. The DOM node associated with the <span>CSS style sheet</span> or
 null if there is no associated DOM node.</p></dd>

 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-css-rule>owner CSS rule</dfn></dt>
 <dd><p>Specified when created. The <span>CSS rule</span> in the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-parent-css-style-sheet>parent CSS style sheet</span>
 that caused the inclusion of the <span>CSS style sheet</span> or null if
 there is no associated rule.</p></dd>

 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-style-sheet-media>media</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>Specified when created. The <code>MediaList</code> object associated with the
  <span>CSS style sheet</span>.</p>

  <p>If this property is specified to a string, the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-media>media</span> must be set to the return value of invoking
  <span>create a <code>MediaList</code> object</span> steps for that string.</p>

  <p>If this property is specified to an attribute of the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-node>owner node</span>, the
  <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-media>media</span> must be set to the return value of invoking <span>create a <code>MediaList</code> object</span> steps
  for the value of that attribute. Whenever the attribute is set, changed or removed, the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-media>media</span>'s
  <code title=dom-MediaList-mediaText>mediaText</code> attribute must be set to the new value of the attribute, or to null if the attribute is absent.

  <p class=note>Changing the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-media>media</span>'s <code title=dom-MediaList-mediaText>mediaText</code> attribute does not
  change the corresponding attribute on the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-node>owner node</span>.
 </dd>

 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>Specified when created. The title of the <span>CSS style sheet</span>, which can be the empty string.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>In the following, the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> is non-empty
   for the first style sheet, but is empty for the second and third style sheets.</p>
   <pre>&lt;style title="papaya whip">
  body { background: #ffefd5; }
&lt;/style></pre>
     <pre>&lt;style title="">
  body { background: orange; }
&lt;/style></pre>
     <pre>&lt;style>
  body { background: brown; }
&lt;/style></pre>
  </div>

  <p>If this property is specified to an attribute of the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-node>owner node</span>, the
  <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> must be set to the value of that attribute. Whenever the attribute is set, changed or removed, the
  <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> must be set to the new value of the attribute, or to the empty string if the attribute is absent.

 </dd>

 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-style-sheet-alternate-flag>alternate flag</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>Specified when created. Either set or unset. Unset by default.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The following <span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span> have
   their <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-alternate-flag>alternate flag</span> set:</p>

   <pre>&lt;?xml-stylesheet alternate="yes" title="x" href="data:text/css,&hellip;"?></pre>

   <pre>&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="x" href="data:text/css,&hellip;"></pre>
  </div>
 </dd>

 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>Either set or unset. Unset by default.</p>

  <p class="note">Even when unset it does not necessarily mean that the
  <span>CSS style sheet</span> is actually used for rendering.</p>
 </dd>


 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-style-sheet-css-rules>CSS rules</dfn></dt>
 <dd><p>The <span title="CSS rule">CSS rules</span> associated with the
 <span>CSS style sheet</span>.</p></dd>

 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-style-sheet-origin-clean-flag>origin-clean flag</dfn>
 <dd><p>Specified when created. Either set or unset. If it is set, the API allows reading and modifying of the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-css-rules>CSS
 rules</span>.

<h4>The <code title>StyleSheet</code> Interface</h4>

<!--
//
// All members defined since DOM-2 Style. Only difference
// is addition of [PutForwards=mediaText], which is presently
// not defined in CSSOM draft.
//
-->

<p>The <code>StyleSheet</code> interface represents an abstract, base style sheet.</p>

<pre class=idl>interface <dfn>StyleSheet</dfn> {
  readonly attribute DOMString <span title=dom-StyleSheet-type>type</span>;
  readonly attribute DOMString? <span title=dom-StyleSheet-href>href</span>;

  --><span title=dom-StyleSheet-media>media</span>;
  attribute boolean <span title=dom-StyleSheet-disabled>disabled</span>;
};</pre>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-StyleSheet-type><code>type</code></dfn> attribute must return the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-type>type</span>.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-StyleSheet-href><code>href</code></dfn> attribute must return the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-location>location</span>.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-StyleSheet-ownerNode><code>ownerNode</code></dfn> attribute must return the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-node>owner
node</span>.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-StyleSheet-parentStyleSheet><code>parentStyleSheet</code></dfn> attribute must return the
<span title=concept-css-style-sheet-parent-css-style-sheet>parent CSS style sheet</span>.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-StyleSheet-title><code>title</code></dfn> attribute must return the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> or null if
<span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> is the empty string.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-StyleSheet-media><code>media</code></dfn> attribute must return the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-media>media</span>.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-StyleSheet-disabled><code>disabled</code></dfn> attribute, on getting, must return true if the
<span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span>
is set, or false otherwise. On setting, the <code title=dom-StyleSheet-disabled>disabled</code> attribute must set the
<span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span> if the new value is true, or unset the
<span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span> otherwise.</p>


<h4>The <code title>CSSStyleSheet</code> Interface</h4>

<!--
//
// All members defined since DOM-2 Style. The only differences are:
//
//   1. removal of raises(DOMException) on {insert,delete}Rule operations.
//
-->

<p>The <code>CSSStyleSheet</code> interface represents a <span>CSS style sheet</span>.</p>
<pre class=idl>interface <dfn>CSSStyleSheet</dfn> : <span>StyleSheet</span> {
  readonly attribute <span>CSSRule</span>? <span title=dom-CSSStyleSheet-ownerRule>ownerRule</span>;
  [SameObject] readonly attribute <span>CSSRuleList</span> <span title=dom-CSSStyleSheet-cssRules>cssRules</span>;
  unsigned long <span title=dom-CSSStyleSheet-insertRule>insertRule</span>(DOMString rule, unsigned long index);
  void <span title=dom-CSSStyleSheet-deleteRule>deleteRule</span>(unsigned long index);
};</pre>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-CSSStyleSheet-ownerRule><code>ownerRule</code></dfn> attribute must return the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-css-rule>owner
CSS rule</span>. If a value other than null is ever returned, then that same value must always be returned on each get access.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-CSSStyleSheet-cssRules><code>cssRules</code></dfn> attribute must follow these steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>If the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-origin-clean-flag>origin-clean flag</span> is unset,
 <span title=concept-throw data-anolis-spec=dom>throw</span> a <code data-anolis-spec=dom>SecurityError</code> exception.
 <li><p>Return a read-only, live <code>CSSRuleList</code> object representing
 the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-css-rules>CSS rules</span>.</p>
 <p class='note'>Even though the returned <code>CSSRuleList</code> object is read-only (from the perspective of
 client-authored script), it can nevertheless change over time due to its liveness status. For example, invoking
 the <code title=dom-CSSStyleSheet-insertRule>insertRule()</code> or <code title=dom-CSSStyleSheet-deleteRule>deleteRule()</code> methods can result in
 mutations reflected in the returned object.</p>
</ol>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-CSSStyleSheet-insertRule><code>insertRule(<var>rule</var>, <var>index</var>)</code></dfn> method must run the following steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>If the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-origin-clean-flag>origin-clean flag</span> is unset,
 <span title=concept-throw data-anolis-spec=dom>throw</span> a <code data-anolis-spec=dom>SecurityError</code> exception.
 <li><p>Return the result of invoking <span>insert a CSS rule</span> <var>rule</var> in the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-css-rules>CSS rules</span>
 at <var>index</var>.
</ol>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-CSSStyleSheet-deleteRule><code>deleteRule(<var>index</var>)</code></dfn> method must run the following steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>If the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-origin-clean-flag>origin-clean flag</span> is unset,
 <span title=concept-throw data-anolis-spec=dom>throw</span> a <code data-anolis-spec=dom>SecurityError</code> exception.
 <li><p><span>Remove a CSS rule</span> in the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-css-rules>CSS rules</span> at <var>index</var>.
</ol>

<h3>CSS Style Sheet Collections</h3>

<p>Below various new concepts are defined that are associated with each
<code data-anolis-spec=dom>Document</code> object.</p>

<p>Each <code data-anolis-spec=dom>Document</code> has an associated list of zero or more
<span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span>, named the
<dfn>document CSS style sheets</dfn>. This is
an ordered list that contains all
<span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span> associated with the
<code data-anolis-spec=dom>Document</code>, in
<span data-anolis-spec=dom title=concept-tree-order>tree order</span>, with
<span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span> created from HTTP
<code title>Link</code> headers first, if any, in header
order.</p>

<p>To <dfn>create a CSS style sheet</dfn>, run these
steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>Create a new <span>CSS style sheet</span> object and set its
 properties as specified.</p></li>

 <li>
  <p>Then run the <span>add a CSS style sheet</span> steps for the newly created <span>CSS style sheet</span>.

  <p class=warning>If the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-origin-clean-flag>origin-clean flag</span> is unset, this can expose information from the user's
  intranet.
</ol>

<p>To <dfn>add a CSS style sheet</dfn>, run these
steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>Add the <span>CSS style sheet</span> to the list of
 <span>document CSS style sheets</span> at the appropriate location. The
 remainder of these steps deal with the
 <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span>.</p></li>

 <li><p>If the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span> is set, terminate
 these steps.</p></li>

 <li><p>If the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> is not the empty string, the
 <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-alternate-flag>alternate flag</span> is unset, and
 <span>preferred CSS style sheet set name</span> is the empty string
 <span>change the preferred CSS style sheet set name</span> to the
 <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span>.</p></li>

 <li>
  <p>If any of the following is true unset the
  <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span> and terminate these steps:

  <ul>
   <li><p>The <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> is the empty string.</p></li>
   <li><p>The <span>last CSS style sheet set name</span> is null and the
   <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> is a
   <span data-anolis-spec=dom>case-sensitive</span> match
   for the <span>preferred CSS style sheet set name</span>.</p></li>
   <li><p>The <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> is a
   <span data-anolis-spec=dom>case-sensitive</span> match for the
   <span>last CSS style sheet set name</span>.</p></li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li><p>Set the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>To <dfn>remove a CSS style sheet</dfn>, run these steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>Remove the <span>CSS style sheet</span> from the list of <span>document CSS style sheets</span>.

 <li><p>Set the <span>CSS style sheet</span>'s <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-parent-css-style-sheet>parent CSS style sheet</span>,
 <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-node>owner node</span> and <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-css-rule>owner CSS rule</span> to null.

 <!-- "associated CSS style sheet" is defined in terms of owner node, so we don't need to set it to null explicitly -->

 <!-- XXX does anything need to happen wrt alternate style sheets? what if the last style sheet with the preferred style sheet set name is removed? -->
</ol>

<p>A <dfn>persistent CSS style sheet</dfn> is a
<span>CSS style sheet</span> from the <span>document CSS style sheets</span>
whose <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> is the empty string and whose
<span title=concept-css-style-sheet-alternate-flag>alternate flag</span> is unset.</p>

<p>A <dfn>CSS style sheet set</dfn> is an ordered
collection of one or more <span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span>
from the <span>document CSS style sheets</span> which have an identical
<span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> that is not the empty string.</p>

<p>A <dfn>CSS style sheet set name</dfn> is the
<span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> the <span>CSS style sheet set</span> has in
common.</p>

<p>An <dfn>enabled CSS style sheet set</dfn> is a
<span>CSS style sheet set</span> of which each <span>CSS style sheet</span> has
its <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span> unset.</p>

<p>To <dfn>enable a CSS style sheet set</dfn>
with name <var>name</var>, run these steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>If <var>name</var> is the empty string, set the
 <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span> for each <span>CSS style sheet</span>
 that is in a <span>CSS style sheet set</span> and terminate these steps.</li>

 <li><p>Unset the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span> for each
 <span>CSS style sheet</span> in a <span>CSS style sheet set</span> whose
 <span>CSS style sheet set name</span> is a
 <span data-anolis-spec=dom>case-sensitive</span> match for
 <var>name</var> and set it for all other
 <span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span> in a
 <span>CSS style sheet set</span>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To <dfn>select a CSS style sheet set</dfn>
with name <var>name</var>, run these steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p><span>enable a CSS style sheet set</span> with name
 <var>name</var>.</p></li>

 <li><p>Set <span>last CSS style sheet set name</span> to
 <var>name</var>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A <dfn>last CSS style sheet set name</dfn>
is a concept to determine what <span>CSS style sheet set</span> was last
<span title="select a CSS style sheet set">selected</span>. Initially its
value is null.</p>

<p>A
<dfn>preferred CSS style sheet set name</dfn>
is a concept to determine which
<span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span> need to have their
<span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span> unset. Initially its value
is the empty string.

<p>To
<dfn>change the preferred CSS style sheet set name</dfn>
with name <var>name</var>, run these steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>current</var> be the <span>preferred CSS style sheet set name</span>.</p></li>

 <li><p>Set <span>preferred CSS style sheet set name</span> to
 <var>name</var>.</p></li>

 <li><p>If <var>name</var> is not a
 <span data-anolis-spec=dom>case-sensitive</span> match for
 <var>current</var> and
 <span>last CSS style sheet set name</span> is null

<h4>The HTTP <code title>Default-Style</code> Header</h4>

<p>The HTTP <code title="http-default-style">Default-Style</code> header
can be used to set the <span>preferred CSS style sheet set name</span>
influencing which <span>CSS style sheet set</span> is (initially) the
<span>enabled CSS style sheet set</span>.</p>

<p>For each HTTP <code title="http-default-style">Default-Style</code>
header, in header order, the user agent must
<span>change the preferred CSS style sheet set name</span> with name being the
value of the header.</p>


<h4>The <code title>StyleSheetList</code> Interface</h4>

<p>The <code>StyleSheetList</code> interface represents an ordered collection of <span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span>.</p>

<pre class=idl>[ArrayClass]
interface <dfn>StyleSheetList</dfn> {
  getter <span>StyleSheet</span>? <span title=dom-StyleSheetList-item>item</span>(unsigned long index);
  readonly attribute unsigned long <span title=dom-StyleSheetList-length>length</span>;
};</pre>

<p>The object's <span data-anolis-spec=webidl>supported property indices</span> are the numbers in the range zero to one less than the number of
<span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span> represented by the collection. If there are no such <span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span>,
then there are no <span data-anolis-spec=webidl>supported property indices</span>.

<p>The <dfn title=dom-StyleSheetList-item><code>item(<var>index</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the <var>index</var>th <span>CSS style
sheet</span> in the collection. If there is no <var>index</var>th object in the collection, then the method must return null.

<p>The <dfn title=dom-StyleSheetList-length><code>length</code></dfn> attribute must return the number of <span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span>
represented by the collection.

<h4>Extensions to the <code title>Document</code> Interface</h4>

<!--
//
// Significant changes since DOM-2 Style:
//
//   1. move styleSheets from separate interface (DocumentStyle) to Document
//   2. addition of selectedStyleSheetSet, lastStyleSheetSet, preferredStyleSheetSet, styleSheetSets, and enableStyleSheetsForSet members
//
// N.B. HTML4 Section 14.3 "External Style Sheets" introduces the concept of a "group [of] alternate style sheets ... under a single style [sheet set] name",
// but does not actually use the term "style sheet set". See http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/present/styles.html#h-14.3 for details.
//
// N.B. According to HTML4 Section 14.3, a "persistent style sheet ... must apply in addition to any alternate style sheet".
//
// N.B. HTML4 Section 14.3 distinguishes the three categories of style sheets as follows:
//
//   * persistent - @rel='stylesheet', @title is missing (or empty string?)
//   * preferred  - @rel='stylesheet', @title is present (and non-empty?)
//   * alternate  - @rel='alternate stylesheet', @title is present (and non-empty?)
//
// Also, HTML5 effectively defines:
//
//   * ignored    - @rel='alternate stylesheet', @title is missing (or is empty string?) - in this case, LinkStyle.style must evaluate to null
//
// N.B. HTML4 Section 4.3 allows author to specify the default preferred style sheet [set]... [presumably in the case that there are multiple preferred style
// sheet sets]:
//
//   * in content - <META http-equiv="Default-Style" content="compact">
//   * in http - e.g., using response header - "Default-Style: compact"
//   * if multiple of the above forms are present, then the LAST one [seen or parsed] takes precedence; HOWEVER, if two or more LINK elements specify preferred
//     style [sheet sets], the FIRST one present in the document takes precedence;
//   * preferred style sheets specified using the above (META or HTTP header equivalent) take precedence over those specified with LINK
//
// N.B. CSSOM Draft presently employs the term "Style Sheet Collection"
//
// Spec Issues:
//
//   1. need to specify which style sheets are included in styleSheets, and in which order:
//
//      * from Link HTTP header reference
//      * from <?xml-stylesheet ...?>
//      * from LINK element, @rel='stylesheet'|'alternate stylesheet'
//      * from STYLE element
//
//   2. for purpose of comparing two titled (named) style sheets, is title (name) compared on case-sensitive or case-insensitive basis
//
//   3. CSSOM 6.2 appears to imply that one can create a CSSStyleSheet (or StyleSheet) object and add it to a Document. However, that is not the case; rather
//      it is necessary to create an HTMLLinkElement or HTMLStyleElement element to indirectly create an empty StyleSheet, then this element can be added to the
//      Document.

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Document-styleSheets><code>styleSheets</code></dfn> attribute must return a <code>StyleSheetList</code> collection representing
the <span>document CSS style sheets</span>.</p>
<p class='note'>Because of historical IDL limitations the <code title=dom-Document-styleSheets>styleSheets</code> attribute
used to be on a separate interface, <code title>DocumentStyle</code>.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Document-selectedStyleSheetSet><code>selectedStyleSheetSet</code></dfn> attribute, on getting, must run these steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>If there is a single <span>enabled CSS style sheet set</span> and no
 other <span>document CSS style sheets</span> with a
 <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> that is not the empty string have the
 <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span> unset, return the
 <span>CSS style sheet set name</span> of the
 <span>enabled CSS style sheet set</span> and terminate these steps.</li>

 <li><p>Otherwise, if <span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span> from
 different <span title='CSS style sheet set'>CSS style sheet sets</span> have
 their <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span> unset, return
 null and terminate these steps.</li>

 <li>
  <p>Otherwise, return the empty string.</p>

  <p class='note'>At this point either all
  <span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span> with a
  <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-title>title</span> that is not the empty string have the
  <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-disabled-flag>disabled flag</span> set, or there are no such
  <span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span>.</p>
 </li>
</ol>

<p>On setting the
<code title='dom-Document-selectedStyleSheetSet'>selectedStyleSheetSet</code>
attribute these steps must be run:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>If the value is null terminate this set of steps.</p></li>
 <li><p>Otherwise, <span>select a CSS style sheet set</span> with the name being the
 value passed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>From the DOM's perspective, all views have the same
<code title='dom-Document-selectedStyleSheetSet'>selectedStyleSheetSet</code>.
If a user agent supports multiple views with different selected
alternative style sheets, then this attribute (and the
<code>StyleSheet</code> interface's
<code title='dom-StyleSheet-disabled'>disabled</code> attribute)
must return and set the value for the default
view.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Document-lastStyleSheetSet><code>lastStyleSheetSet</code></dfn> attribute must return the <span>last CSS style sheet set name</span>.</p>
<p class='note'>This attribute is initially null.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Document-preferredStyleSheetSet><code>preferredStyleSheetSet</code></dfn> attribute must return the <span>preferred CSS style sheet set
name</span>.</p>
<p class='note'>Unlike <code title='dom-Document-lastStyleSheetSet'>lastStyleSheetSet</code>,
this attribute is initially the empty string.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Document-styleSheetSets><code>styleSheetSets</code></dfn> attribute must return a read only array of the
<span title='CSS style sheet set name'>CSS style sheet set names</span> of the <span title='CSS style sheet set'>CSS style sheet sets</span>, in order of the
<span>document CSS style sheets</span>. The array is live; if the <span>document CSS style sheets</span> change, the array must be updated as appropriate.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Document-enableStyleSheetsForSet><code>enableStyleSheetsForSet(<var>name</var>)</code></dfn> method must, when invoked, run these

<ol>
 <li><p>If <var>name</var> is null terminate these steps.</p></li>
 <li><p><span>enable a CSS style sheet set</span> with name <var>name</var>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class='note'><span title='CSS style sheet'>CSS style sheets</span> with a

This method does not change the values of the
<code title='dom-Document-lastStyleSheetSet'>lastStyleSheetSet</code> or
<code title='dom-Document-preferredStyleSheetSet'>preferredStyleSheetSet</code> attributes.</p>


<h4>Interaction with the User Interface</h4>

<p>The user interface of Web browsers that support style sheets
should list the style sheet titles given in the
<code title="dom-Document-styleSheetSets">styleSheetSets</code> list,
showing the
<code title="dom-Document-selectedStyleSheetSet">selectedStyleSheetSet</code>
as the selected style sheet set, leaving none selected if it is
null or the empty string, and selecting an extra option
"Basic Page Style" (or similar) if it is the empty string and the
<code title="dom-Document-preferredStyleSheetSet">preferredStyleSheetSet</code>
is the empty string as well.</p>

<p>Selecting a style sheet from this list should
use the <span>select a CSS style sheet set</span> set of steps. This
(by definition) affects the
<code title="dom-Document-lastStyleSheetSet">lastStyleSheetSet</code>
attribute.</p>

<h5>Persisting the selected CSS style sheet set</h5>

<p>If a user agent persist the <span title="select a CSS style sheet set">selected</span> <span>CSS style sheet set</span>, it should use
the value of the
<code title="dom-Document-selectedStyleSheetSet">selectedStyleSheetSet</code>
attribute, or if that is null, the
<code title="dom-Document-lastStyleSheetSet">lastStyleSheetSet</code>
attribute, when leaving the page (or at some other time) to determine the
set name to store. If that is null then the <span>CSS style sheet set</span> should not be
persisted.</p>

<p>When re-setting the <span>CSS style sheet set</span> to the persisted value (which can
happen at any time, typically at the first time the <span title="CSS style sheet">CSS style sheets</span> are
needed for styling the document, after the <code title>&lt;head&gt;</code> of
the document has been parsed, after any scripts that are not dependent on
computed style have executed), the <span>CSS style sheet set</span>
should be set by using the
<span>select a CSS style sheet set</span> set of steps as if the user had
selected the <span>CSS style sheet set</span> manually.</p>

<p class="note">This specification does not give any suggestions on
how user agents are to decide to persist the <span>CSS style sheet set</span> or whether or
how to persist the <span title="select a CSS style sheet set">selected</span> <span>CSS style sheet set</span> across pages.</p>

<!-- XXX this UI section suggests we may want to introduce a few more
     idioms -->


<h4>Examples</h4>

<div class="example">
 <p>Thus, in the following HTML snippet:</p>

 <pre>&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="foo" href="a"&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="bar" href="b"&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  document.selectedStyleSheetSet = 'foo';
  document.styleSheets[1].disabled = false;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="foo" href="c"&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="bar" href="d"&gt;</pre>

 <p>...the style sheets that end up enabled are style sheets "a", "b",
 and "c", the
 <code title="dom-Document-selectedStyleSheetSet">selectedStyleSheetSet</code>
 attribute would return null,
 <code title="dom-Document-lastStyleSheetSet">lastStyleSheetSet</code>
 would return "foo", and
 <code title="dom-Document-preferredStyleSheetSet">preferredStyleSheetSet</code>
 would return the empty string.</p>

 <p>Similarly, in the following HTML snippet:</p>

 <pre>&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="foo" href="a"&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="bar" href="b"&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var before = document.preferredStyleSheetSet;
  document.styleSheets[1].disabled = false;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" title="foo" href="c"&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="bar" href="d"&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var after = document.preferredStyleSheetSet;
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

 <p>...the "before" variable will be equal to the empty string, the
 "after" variable will be equal to "foo", and style sheets "a" and "c"
 will be enabled. This is the case even though the first script block
 sets style sheet "b" to be enabled, because upon parsing the
 following <code title>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, the
 <code title="dom-Document-preferredStyleSheetSet">preferredStyleSheetSet</code>
 is set and the
 <code title="dom-Document-enableStyleSheetsForSet">enableStyleSheetsForSet()</code>
 method is called (since
 <code title="dom-Document-selectedStyleSheetSet">selectedStyleSheetSet</code>
 was never set
 explicitly, leaving
 <code title="dom-Document-lastStyleSheetSet">lastStyleSheetSet</code> at
 null throughout), which changes which style sheets are enabled and which
 are not.</p>
</div>


<h3>Style Sheet Association</h3>

<p>This section defines the interface an
<span title=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-node>owner node</span> of a <span>CSS style sheet</span> has to
implement and defines the requirements for
<span data-anolis-spec=xmlss title="xml-stylesheet processing instruction">xml-stylesheet processing instructions</span>
and HTTP <code title>Link</code> headers when the link
relation type is an
<span data-anolis-spec=dom>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for
"<code title>stylesheet</code>" since nobody else was interested in
defining this.</p>

<p class=note>The editor is in good hope that HTML and SVG will define the
appropriate processing in their respective specifications, in terms of
this specification, in due course.</p>


<h4>Fetching CSS style sheets</h4>

<p>To <dfn>fetch a CSS style sheet</dfn> with parsed URL <var>parsed URL</var>, referrer <var>referrer</var>, document
<var>document</var>, optionally a set of parameters <var>parameters</var> (used as input to creating a
<span data-anolis-spec=fetch title=concept-request>request</span>), follow these steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>origin</var> be <var>document</var>'s <span data-anolis-spec=html>origin</span>.

 <li><p>Let <var>request</var> be a new <span data-anolis-spec=fetch title=concept-request>request</span>, with the
 <span data-anolis-spec=fetch title=concept-request-url>url</span> <var>parsed URL</var>,
 <span data-anolis-spec=fetch title=concept-request-origin>origin</span> <var>origin</var>,
 <span data-anolis-spec=fetch title=concept-request-referrer>referrer</span> <var>referrer</var>, and if specified the set of parameters <var>parameters</var>.

 <li><p>Let <var>response</var> be the result of <span data-anolis-spec=fetch title=concept-fetch>fetching</span> <var>request</var>.</p></li>

 <li><p>Wait until <var>response</var> is available.

 <li><p>If <var>response</var> is a <span data-anolis-spec=fetch title=concept-network-error>network error</span>, return an error.

 <li><p>If <var>document</var> is in <span data-anolis-spec=dom title=concept-document-quirks>quirks mode</span>, <var>response</var> is
 <span title>CORS-same-origin</span><!--XXX xref--> and the <span data-anolis-spec=html>Content-Type metadata</span> of <var>response</var> is not a
 <span>supported styling language</span> change the <span data-anolis-spec=html>Content-Type metadata</span> of <var>response</var> to
 <code title>text/css</code>.

 <li><p>If <var>response</var> is not in a <span>supported styling language</span> return an error.</p></li>

 <li><p>Return <var>response</var>.
</ol>

<h4>The <code title>LinkStyle</code> Interface</h4>

<p>The <dfn>associated CSS style sheet</dfn> of a node is the <span>CSS style sheet</span> in the list of
<span>document CSS style sheets</span> of which the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-owner-node>owner node</span> implements the <code>LinkStyle</code>
interface.</p>

<pre class=idl>[NoInterfaceObject]
interface <dfn>LinkStyle</dfn> {
  readonly attribute <span>StyleSheet</span>? <span title=dom-LinkStyle-sheet>sheet</span>;
};</pre>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-LinkStyle-sheet><code>sheet</code></dfn> attribute must return the <span>associated CSS style sheet</span> for the node or null
if there is no <span>associated CSS style sheet</span>.</p>

<div class="example">
 <p>In the following fragment, the first <code title>style</code>
 element has a <code title=dom-LinkStyle-sheet>sheet</code> attribute that returns a
 <code>StyleSheet</code> object representing the style sheet, but for
 the second <code title>style</code> element, the <code title=dom-LinkStyle-sheet>sheet</code> attribute returns null,
 assuming the user agent supports CSS (<code title>text/css</code>), but does
 not support the (hypothetical) ExampleSheets (<code title>text/example-sheets</code>).</p>

 <pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  body { background:lime }
&lt;/style&gt;</pre>
   <pre>&lt;style type="text/example-sheets"&gt;
  $(body).background := lime
&lt;/style&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p class="note">Whether or not the node refers to a style sheet is defined
by the specification that defines the semantics of said node.</p>


<h4>Requirements on specifications</h4>

<p>Specifications introducing new ways of associating style sheets through
the DOM should define which nodes implement the
<code>LinkStyle</code> interface. When doing so, they
must also define when a <span>CSS style sheet</span> is
<span title="create a CSS style sheet">created</span>.</p>





<h4>Requirements on User Agents Implementing the xml-stylesheet processing instruction</h4>

<!-- XXX load/error events -->

<pre class="idl"><span data-anolis-spec=dom>ProcessingInstruction</span> implements <span>LinkStyle</span>;</pre>

<p>The <dfn>prolog</dfn> refers to <span data-anolis-spec=dom title=concept-node>nodes</span> that are children of the
<span data-anolis-spec=dom title=concept-document>document</span> and are not <span data-anolis-spec=dom title=concept-tree-following>following</span> the
<code data-anolis-spec=dom>Element</code> child of the <span data-anolis-spec=dom title=concept-document>document</span>, if any.

<p>When a <code data-anolis-spec=dom>ProcessingInstruction</code> <span data-anolis-spec=dom title=concept-node>node</span> <var>node</var> becomes part of the
<span>prolog</span>, is no longer part of the <span>prolog</span>, or has its <span data-anolis-spec=dom title=concept-cd-data>data</span> changed, these steps
must be run:

<ol>
 <li><p>If an instance of this algorithm is currently running for <var>node</var>, abort that instance, and stop the associated
 <span data-anolis-spec=fetch title=concept-fetch>fetching</span> if applicable.

 <li><p>If <var>node</var> has an <span>associated CSS style sheet</span>, <span title="remove a CSS style sheet">remove</span> it.

 <li><p>If <var>node</var> is not an <span data-anolis-spec=xmlss>xml-stylesheet processing instruction</span>, terminate these steps.

 <li><p>If <var>node</var> does not have an <code title>href</code> <span data-anolis-spec=xmlss>pseudo-attribute</span>, terminate these steps.

 <li><p>Let <var>title</var> be the value of the
 <code title>title</code> <span data-anolis-spec=xmlss>pseudo-attribute</span> or the empty string if the
 <code title>title</code> <span data-anolis-spec=xmlss>pseudo-attribute</span> is not specified.</p></li>

 <li><p>If there is an <code title>alternate</code> <span data-anolis-spec=xmlss>pseudo-attribute</span>

 <li><p>If there is a <code title>type</code> <span data-anolis-spec=xmlss>pseudo-attribute</span> whose

 <li><p>Let <var>document</var> be <var>node</var>'s <span data-anolis-spec=dom title=concept-node-document>node document</span>

 <li><p>Let <var>base URL</var> be <var>document</var>'s <span data-anolis-spec=html>document base URL</span>.

 <li><p>Let <var>referrer</var> be <var>document</var>'s <span data-anolis-spec=html title="the document's address">address</span>.

<h3>CSS Rules</h3>

<p>A <dfn>CSS rule</dfn> is an abstract concept that
denotes a rule as defined by the CSS specification. A
<span>CSS rule</span> is represented as an object that implements a subclass of
the <code>CSSRule</code> interface, and which has the following
associated state items:</p>

<dl>
<dt><dfn title=concept-css-rule-type>type</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>A non-negative integer associated with a particular type of rule.
This item is initialized when a rule is created and cannot change.</p></dd>

<dt><dfn title=concept-css-rule-text>text</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>A text representation of the rule suitable for direct use in a style sheet.
This item is initialized when a rule is created and can be changed.</p></dd>

<dt><dfn title=concept-css-rule-parent-css-rule>parent CSS rule</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>A reference to an enclosing <span>CSS rule</span> or null.
If the rule has an enclosing rule when it is created, then this item is initialized to the enclosing rule; otherwise it is null. It can be changed to
null.</p></dd>

<dt><dfn title=concept-css-rule-parent-css-style-sheet>parent CSS style sheet</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>A reference to a parent <span>CSS style sheet</span> or null.
This item is initialized to reference an associated style sheet when the rule is created. It can be changed to null.</p></dd>

<dt><dfn title=concept-css-rule-child-css-rules>child CSS rules</dfn>
<dd><p>A list of child <span title="CSS rule">CSS rules</span>. The list can be mutated.
</dl>

<p>In addition to the above state, each <span>CSS rule</span> may be associated
with other state in accordance with its <span title=concept-css-rule-type>type</span>.</p>

<p>To <dfn>parse a CSS rule</dfn> from a string <var>string</var>, run the following steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>rule</var> be the return value of invoking <span data-anolis-spec=csssyntax>parse a rule</span> with <var>string</var>.
 <li><p>If <var>rule</var> is a syntax error, return <var>rule</var>.
 <li><p>Let <var>parsed rule</var> be the result of parsing <var>rule</var> according to the appropriate CSS specifications, dropping parts that are said to be
 ignored. If the whole style rule is dropped, return a syntax error.
 <li><p>Return <var>parsed rule</var>.

<h4>The <code title>CSSNamespaceRule</code> Interface</h4>

<p>The <code>CSSNamespaceRule</code> interface represents an <code title>@namespace</code> at-rule.</p>

<pre class=idl>interface <dfn>CSSNamespaceRule</dfn> : <span>CSSRule</span> {
  [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] attribute DOMString <span title=dom-CSSNamespaceRule-namespaceURI>namespaceURI</span>;
  [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] attribute DOMString <span title=dom-CSSNamespaceRule-prefix>prefix</span>;
};</pre>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-CSSNamespaceRule-namespaceURI><code>namespaceURI</code></dfn> attribute, on getting, must return the namespace of the
<code title>@namespace</code> at-rule.

<p>On setting, the <code title=dom-CSSNamespaceRule-namespaceURI>namespaceURI</code> attribute must run the following steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>parent</var> be the <span title=concept-css-rule-parent-css-style-sheet>parent CSS style sheet</span>.
 <li><p>Let <var>list</var> be the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-css-rules>CSS rules</span> of <var>parent</var>, or
 null if <var>parent</var> is null.
 <li><p>If <var>list</var> is not null and contains anything other than
 <code title>@charset</code> at-rules, <code title>@import</code> at-rules, and <code title>@namespace</code> at-rules,
 <span data-anolis-spec='dom' title='concept-throw'>throw</span> an <code data-anolis-spec=dom>InvalidStateError</code> exception.
 <li><p>Set the namespace of the <code title>@namespace</code> at-rule to the given value.
</ol>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-CSSNamespaceRule-prefix><code>prefix</code></dfn> attribute must return the prefix of the <code title>@namespace</code> at-rule or the
empty string if there is no prefix.

<p>On setting, the <code title=dom-CSSNamespaceRule-prefix>prefix</code> attribute must run the following steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>parent</var> be the <span title=concept-css-rule-parent-css-style-sheet>parent CSS style sheet</span>.
 <li><p>Let <var>list</var> be the <span title=concept-css-style-sheet-css-rules>CSS rules</span> of <var>parent</var>, or
 null if <var>parent</var> is null.
 <li><p>If <var>list</var> is not null and contains anything other than
 <code title>@charset</code> at-rules, <code title>@import</code> at-rules, and <code title>@namespace</code> at-rules,
 <span data-anolis-spec='dom' title='concept-throw'>throw</span> an <code data-anolis-spec=dom>InvalidStateError</code> exception.
 <li><p>Set the prefix of the <code title>@namespace</code> at-rule to the given value.
</ol>


<h3>CSS Declarations</h3>

<p>A <dfn>CSS declaration</dfn> is an abstract concept that is not exposed as an object in the DOM. A <span>CSS declaration</span> has the following associated
properties:

<dl>
 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-declaration-property-name>property name</dfn>
 <dd><p>The property name of the declaration.
 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-declaration-value>value</dfn>
 <dd><p>The value of the declaration represented as a list of component values.
 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-declaration-important-flag>important flag</dfn>
 <dd><p>Either set or unset. Can be changed.
 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-declaration-case-sensitive-flag>case-sensitive flag</dfn>
 <dd><p>Set if the <span title=concept-css-declaration-property-name>property name</span> is defined to be case-sensitive according to its specification,
 otherwise unset.
</dl>

<h3>CSS Declaration Blocks</h3>

<p>A <dfn>CSS declaration block</dfn> is an ordered collection of CSS
properties with their associated values, also named <span title="CSS declaration">CSS declarations</span>. In
the DOM a <span>CSS declaration block</span> is a
<code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> object. A
<span>CSS declaration block</span> has the following associated properties:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-declaration-block-readonly-flag>readonly flag</dfn></dt>
 <dd><p>Unset if the object can be manipulated. Set if it can not be
 manipulated. Unless otherwise stated it is unset.</p></dd>

 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-declaration-block-declarations>declarations</dfn></dt>
 <dd><p>The <span title="CSS declaration">CSS declarations</span> associated with the object.</p></dd>

 <dt><dfn title=contept-css-declaration-block-parent-css-rule>parent CSS rule</dfn>
 <dd><p>The <span>CSS rule</span> that the <span>CSS declaration block</span> is associated with, if any, or null otherwise.

 <dt><dfn title=concept-css-declaration-block-owner-node>owner node</dfn>
 <dd><p>The <span data-anolis-spec=dom>Element</span> or <span>PseudoElement</span> that the <span>CSS declaration block</span> is associated with, if any, or
 null otherwise.
</dl>

<p>To <dfn>parse a CSS declaration block</dfn> from a string <var>string</var>, follow these steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>declarations</var> be the return value of invoking <span data-anolis-spec=csssyntax>parse a list of declarations</span> with <var>string</var>.
 <li><p>Let <var>parsed declarations</var> be a new empty list.
 <li><p>For each item <var>declaration</var> in <var>declarations</var>, follow these substeps:
  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <var>parsed declaration</var> be the result of parsing <var>declaration</var> according to the appropriate CSS specifications, dropping parts that
   are said to be ignored. If the whole declaration is dropped, let <var>parsed declaration</var> be null.
   <li><p>If <var>parsed declaration</var> is not null, append it to <var>parsed declarations</var>.
  </ol>
 <li><p>Return <var>parsed declarations</var>.
</ol>

<p>To <dfn>serialize a CSS declaration</dfn> with property name <var>property</var>, value <var>value</var> and optionally an <i>important</i> flag set, follow
these steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>s</var> be the empty string.
 <li><p>Append <var>property</var> to <var>s</var>.
 <li><p>Append "<code title>: </code>" (U+003A U+0020) to <var>s</var>.

 <li><p>Append "<code title>;</code>" (U+003B) to <var>s</var>.
 <li><p>Return <var>s</var>.
</ol>

<p>To <dfn>serialize a CSS declaration block</dfn> <var>declaration block</var> means to run the steps below:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>list</var> be an empty array.
 <li><p>Let <var>already serialized</var> be an empty array.
 <li><p><i>Declaration loop</i>: For each <span>CSS declaration</span> <var>declaration</var> in <var>declaration block</var>'s

     maps to one of the shorthand properties in <var>shorthands</var>.
     <li><p><i>Shorthand loop</i>: For each <var>shorthand</var> in <var>shorthands</var>, follow these substeps:
      <ol>
       <li><p>If all properties that map to <var>shorthand</var> are not present in <var>longhands</var>, continue with the steps labeled <i>shorthand loop</i>.
       <li><p>Let <var>current longhands</var> be an empty array.

       <li><p>Let <var>value</var> be the result of invoking <span>serialize a CSS value</span> of <var>current longhands</var>.
       <li><p>If <var>value</var> is the empty string, continue with the steps labeled <i>shorthand loop</i>.
       <li><p>Let <var>serialized declaration</var> be the result of invoking <span>serialize a CSS declaration</span> with property name
       <var>shorthand</var>, value <var>value</var>, and the <i>important</i> flag set if the <span title="CSS declaration">CSS declarations</span> in
       <var>current longhands</var> have their <span title=concept-css-declaration-important-flag>important flag</span> set.
       <li><p>Append <var>serialized declaration</var> to <var>list</var>.

  </ol>
 <li><p>Return <var>list</var> joined with "<code title> </code>" (U+0020).
</ol>

<p class="note">The serialization of an empty CSS declaration block is the empty string.</p>

<p class="note">The serialization of a non-empty CSS declaration block does not include any surrounding whitespace, i.e., no whitepsace appears
before the first property name and no whitespace appears after the final semicolon delimiter that follows the last property value.</p>

<p>The <dfn title=concept-shorthands-preferred-order>preferred order</dfn> of a list of shorthand properties <var>shorthands</var> is as follows:

<ol>
 <li><p>Order <var>shorthands</var> lexicographically.
 <li><p>Move all items in <var>shorthands</var> that begin with "<code title>-</code>" (U+002D) last in the list, retaining their relative order.
 <li><p>Move all items in <var>shorthands</var> that begin with "<code title>-</code>" (U+002D) but do not begin with "<code title>-webkit-</code>" last in the
 list, retaining their relative order.
 <li><p>Order <var>shorthands</var> by the number of longhand properties that map to it, with the greatest number first.
</ol>

<h3>CSS Values</h3>


<h4>Parsing CSS Values</h4>

<p>To <dfn>parse a CSS value</dfn> <var>value</var> for a given
<var>property</var> means to follow these steps:

<ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>list</var> be the value returned by invoking <span data-anolis-spec=csssyntax>parse a list of component values</span> from <var>value</var>.
 <li><p>Match <var>list</var> against the grammar for the property <var>property</var> in the CSS specification.
 <li><p>If the above step failed, return null.
 <li><p>Return <var>list</var>.
</ol>

<p class="note">"<code title>!important</code>" declarations are not
part of the property value space and will therefore cause
<span>parse a CSS value</span> to return null.</p>



<h4>Serializing CSS Values</h4>

<!-- based on http://damowmow.com/playground/canon.txt -->

<p>To <dfn>serialize a CSS value</dfn> of a <span>CSS declaration</span> <var>declaration</var> or a list of longhand <span title="CSS declaration">CSS
declarations</span> <var>list</var>, follow these rules:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>If this algorithm is invoked with a list <var>list</var>, follow these substeps:
  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <var>shorthand</var> be the shorthand property that exactly maps to all the longhand properties in <var>list</var>. If there are multiple such
   shorthand properties, use the first in <span title=concept-shorthands-preferred-order>preferred order</span>.
   <li><p>If <var>shorthand</var> cannot represent the values of <var>list</var> in its grammar, return the empty string and terminate these steps.
   <li><p>Let <var>trimmed list</var> be a new empty array.
   <li><p>For each <span>CSS declaration</span> <var>declaration</var> in <var>list</var>, if <var>declaration</var>'s
   <span title=concept-css-declaration-value>value</span> is not the initial value, or if
   <var>declaration</var> is a required component of the <var>shorthand</var> property, append <var>declaration</var> to <var>trimmed list</var>.
   <li><p>If <var>trimmed list</var> is empty, append the value of the first item in <var>list</var> to <var>trimmed list</var>.
   <li><p>Let <var>values</var> be a new empty array.
   <li><p>For each <span>CSS declaration</span> <var>declaration</var> in <var>trimmed list</var>, invoke <span>serialize a CSS value</span> of
   <var>declaration</var>, and append the result to <var>values</var>.
   <li><p>Return the result of joining <var>values</var> as appropriate according to the grammar of <var>shorthand</var> and terminate these steps.
  </ol>
 <li><p>Let <var>values</var> be a new empty array.
 <li><p>Append the result of invoking <span>serialize a CSS component value</span> of <var>declaration</var>'s
 <span title=concept-css-declaration-value>value</span> to <var>values</var>.
 <li><p>If the grammar of the <span title=concept-css-declaration-property-name>property name</span> of <var>declaration</var> is defined to be
 whitespace-separated, return the result of invoking <span>serialize a whitespace-separated list</span> of <var>values</var> and terminate these steps.
 <li><p>If the grammar of the <span title=concept-css-declaration-property-name>property name</span> of <var>declaration</var> is defined to be comma-separated,
 return the result of invoking <span>serialize a comma-separated list</span> of <var>values</var>.
</ol>

<p>To
<dfn>serialize a CSS component value</dfn>
depends on the component, as follows:</p>

<dl class="switch">
 <dt>keyword</dt>
 <dd><p>The keyword
 <span data-anolis-spec=dom>converted to ASCII lowercase</span>.</p></dd>

 <dt>&lt;angle></dt>
 <dd><p>The &lt;number> component serialized as per &lt;number> followed by the unit in canonical form as defined in its respective specification.</p></dd>

 <dt>&lt;color></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If &lt;color&gt; is a component of a resolved or computed value, then
 return the color using the <code title>rgb()</code> or <code title>rgba()</code> functional
 notation as follows:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>If the alpha component of the color is equal to one, then return the serialization of the
 <code title>rgb()</code> functional equivalent of the opaque color.</li>
 <li>If the alpha component of the color is not equal to one, then return the serialization of the
 <code title>rgba()</code> functional equivalent of the non-opaque color.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>The serialization of the <code title>rgb()</code> functional equivalent is the concatenation of the following:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>The string "<code title>rgb(</code>".</li>
 <li>The shortest base-ten integer serialization of the color's red component.</li>
 <li>The string "<code title>, </code>".</li>
 <li>The shortest base-ten serialization of the color's green component.</li>
 <li>The string "<code title>, </code>".</li>
 <li>The shortest base-ten serialization of the color's blue component.</li>
 <li>The string "<code title>)</code>".</li>
 </ol>
 <p>The serialization of the <code title>rgba()</code> functional equivalent is the concatenation of the following:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>The string "<code title>rgba(</code>".</li>
 <li>The shortest base-ten serialization of the color's red component.</li>
 <li>The string "<code title>, </code>".</li>
 <li>The shortest base-ten serialization of the color's green component.</li>
 <li>The string "<code title>, </code>".</li>
 <li>The shortest base-ten serialization of the color's blue component.</li>
 <li>The string "<code title>, </code>".</li>
 <li>The shortest serialization of the &lt;number&gt; that denotes the color's alpha component.</li>
 <li>The string "<code title>)</code>".</li>
 </ol>

 <p>In the above rules, the string "<code title>, </code>" denotes a COMMA (U+002C) followed by a single SPACE (U+0020).</p>

 <p>If &lt;color&gt; is a component of a specified value, then
 return the color as follows:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>If the color was explicitly specified by the author, then return the original, author specified color value.</li>
 <li>Otherwise, return the value that would be returned if the color were a component of a computed value.</li>

<h3>Extensions to the <code title>Element</code> Interface</h3>

<pre class=idl>partial interface <span data-anolis-spec=dom>Element</span> {
  <span>PseudoElement</span>? <span title=dom-Element-pseudo>pseudo</span>(DOMString pseudoElt);
};

<span data-anolis-spec=dom>Element</span> implements <span>GetStyleUtils</span>;</pre>

<p class=atrisk>The <dfn title=dom-Element-pseudo><code>pseudo(<var>pseudoElt</var>)</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must run the following steps:
<ol>
 <li><p>If <var>pseudoElt</var> is as an <span data-anolis-spec=dom>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for either ':before' or
 '::before' return the <code>PseudoElement</code> representing the <span>::before pseudo-element</span> of the
 <span data-anolis-spec=dom>context object</span>.</p></li>
 <li><p>If <var>pseudoElt</var> is as an <span data-anolis-spec=dom>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for either ':after' or
 '::after' return the <code>PseudoElement</code> representing the <span>::after pseudo-element</span> of the
 <span data-anolis-spec=dom>context object</span>.</p></li>
 <li><p>Return null.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When invoked with an argument that returns a <code>PseudoElement</code> object representing a particular pseudo-element, the same object must be
returned as returned by an earlier call that represent the same pseudo-element.</p>



<h3>The <code title>PseudoElement</code> Interface</h3>

<p class=atrisk>The <code>PseudoElement</code> interface is used for representing CSS pseudo-elements. A <code>PseudoElement</code> object is associated with an
<code data-anolis-spec=dom>Element</code> object.</p>

<pre class=idl>interface <dfn>PseudoElement</dfn> {
};

<span>PseudoElement</span> implements <span>GetStyleUtils</span>;</pre>


<h2>Utility APIs</h2>

<h3>The <code title>CSS.escape()</code> Method</h3>

<p>The <code title>CSS</code> interface is defined in CSS Conditional Rules Module. <span data-anolis-ref>CSSCONDITIONAL</span>

<pre class=idl>partial interface CSS {
  static DOMString <span title=dom-CSS-escape>escape</span>(DOMString ident);
};</pre>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-CSS-escape><code>escape(<var>ident</var>)</code></dfn> method must return the result of invoking <span>serialize an identifier</span> of
<var>ident</var>. Any exceptions thrown must be re-thrown.

<div class=example>
 <p>For example, to escape a string for use as part of a selector, the <code title=dom-CSS-escape>escape()</code> method can be used:
 <pre>var element = document.querySelector('#' + CSS.escape(id) + ' > img');</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
 <p>The <code title=dom-CSS-escape>escape()</code> method can also be used for escaping strings, although it escapes characters that don't strictly need to be
 escaped:
 <pre>var element = document.querySelector('a[href="#' + CSS.escape(fragment) + '"]');</pre>
</div>


<h2>Resolved Values</h2>

<p><code title="dom-Window-getComputedStyle">getComputedStyle()</code> was
historically defined to return the "computed value" of an element or
pseudo-element. However, the concept of "computed value" changed between
revisions of CSS while the implementation of
<code title="dom-Window-getComputedStyle">getComputedStyle()</code> had to
remain the same for compatibility with deployed scripts. To address this
issue this specification introduces the concept of a
<dfn>resolved value</dfn>.</p>

<p>The <span>resolved value</span> for a given property can be determined
as follows:</p>

<dl class="switch">
 <!--
 We want to treat shorthand properties like any other value basically.

 <dt>'background'
 <dt>'border'
 <dt>'border-collapse'
 <dt>'border-color'
 <dt>'border-spacing'
 <dt>'border-style'
 <dt>'border-top'
 <dt>'border-right'
 <dt>'border-bottom'
 <dt>'border-left'
 <dt>'border-width'
 <dt>'font'
 <dt>'list-style'
 <dt>'margin'
 <dt>'outline'
 <!- - overflow is not - ->
 <dt>'padding'
 <dt>'pause'
 <dd>
  <p>There is no <span>resolved value</span>.</p>
 </dd>
 -->

 <dt>'line-height'</dt>
 <dd><p>The <span>resolved value</span> is the <span>used value</span>.</p></dd>

 <dt>'height'</dt>
 <dt>'margin'</dt>
 <dt>'margin-bottom'</dt>
 <dt>'margin-left'</dt>
 <dt>'margin-right'</dt>
 <dt>'margin-top'</dt>
 <dt>'padding'</dt>
 <dt>'padding-bottom'</dt>
 <dt>'padding-left'</dt>
 <dt>'padding-right'</dt>
 <dt>'padding-top'</dt>
 <dt>'width'</dt>
 <dd><p>If the property applies to the element or pseudo-element and the
 <span>resolved value</span> of the 'display' property is not
 'none', the <span>resolved value</span> is the
 <span>used value</span>. Otherwise the <span>resolved value</span> is the
 <span>computed value</span>.</p></dd>

 <dt>'bottom'</dt>
 <dt>'left'</dt>
 <dt>'right'</dt>
 <dt>'top'</dt>
 <dd><p>If the property applies to a positioned element and the
 <span>resolved value</span> of the 'display' property is not
 'none', the <span>resolved value</span> is the
 <span>used value</span>. Otherwise the <span>resolved value</span> is the
 computed value.</p></dd>

 <dt>Any other property</dt>
 <dd><p>The <span>resolved value</span> is the <span>computed value</span>.</p></dd>
</dl>

(now serialization) rules for CSS values.</p>

<!-- XXX NOTES

<style type=text/css;charset=utf-8> does create a StyleSheet in Firefox
and Opera, but does not create a StyleSheet in IE. I prefer IE.

<style type=TEXT/CSS> sets the style sheet type to text/css in Firefox and
TEXT/CSS in Opera and IE. I prefer Firefox.

<style> sets the style sheet location to the document location Firefox,
the empty string in IE, and null in Opera. I prefer Opera

<style media="x"> invokes .sheet.media.mediaText = "x"

<style> does not "have" a title

.cascadedStyle that returns less keywords than currentStyle, no inherit,
etc.
