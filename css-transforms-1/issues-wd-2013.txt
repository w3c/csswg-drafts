2D Transforms Only (3D Transforms move to L2 per WG resolution)

Unfiled threads:
  * Someone figure out if thread at https://www.w3.org/mid/F1CB6513-BAD8-4CCA-8658-194EDEB7C2C8@andrewdupont.net concluded?
  	- spec already says that transforms affect getBoundingClientRect.
  * Ditto http://www.w3.org/mid/510806D8.5050403@w3.org
  	- this is addressed by the GeometryUtils interface: https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#the-geometryutils-interface
  * Make sure https://www.w3.org/mid/B7126E1C-EB7C-4D9F-9238-F9CDD72BDB21@adobe.com doesn't affect 2D else file it herein.
  	- filed https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/907
  * Is http://www.w3.org/mid/CAGN7qDBomdt1QFyM_VsydiY=Vo-PcyX9T7ZSHb8raEA=-Vfvjg@mail.gmail.com filed somewhere?
  	- seems like an implementor issue?

Issues are thematically sorted.
Recommend to start with will-change issue, then start at the top and work down.
