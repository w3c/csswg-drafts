<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p><em>This section is not normative.</em>
      <p>
        This document introduces new CSS features to enable <em>implicit transitions</em>, which describe how CSS properties can be made to change smoothly from one value to another over a given duration.
      </p>

<h2 id="transitions"><a title="" id="transitions-">Transitions</a></h2>
      <p>
        Normally when the value of a CSS property changes, the rendered result is instantly updated, with the affected elements immediately changing from the old property value to the new property value. This section describes a way to specify transitions using new CSS properties. These properties are used to animate smoothly from the old state to the new state over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, suppose that transitions of one second have been defined on the 'left' and
        'background-color' properties. The following diagram illustrates the effect of updating those properties on an element, in this case moving it to the right and changing the background from red to blue. This assumes other transition parameters still have their default values.
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="transition1.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <p class="caption">
        Transitions of 'left' and 'background-color'
      </p>
      <p>
        Transitions are a presentational effect. The computed value of a property transitions over time from the old value to the new value. Therefore if a script queries the computed style of a property as it is transitioning, it will see an intermediate value that represents the current animated value of the property.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only animatable CSS properties can be transitioned. See the table at the end of this document for a list
        of properties that are animatable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The transition for a property is defined using a number of new properties. For example:
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <p style="display:none">
          Example(s):
        </p>
        <pre>
  div {
    transition-property: opacity;
    transition-duration: 2s;
  }
  </pre>The above example defines a transition on the 'opacity' property that, when a new value is assigned to it, will cause a smooth change between the old value and the new value over a period of two seconds.
      </div>
      <p>
        Each of the transition properties accepts a comma-separated list, allowing multiple transitions to be defined, each acting on a different property. In this case, the individual transitions take their parameters from the same index in all the lists. For example:
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <p style="display:none">
          Example(s):
        </p>
        <pre>
  div {
    transition-property: opacity, left;
    transition-duration: 2s, 4s;
  }

  </pre>This will cause the 'opacity' property to transition over a period of two seconds and the left property to transition over a period of four seconds.
      </div>

      <p id="list-matching">
        In the case where the lists of values in transition properties
        do not have the same length, the length of the
        'transition-property' list determines the number of items in
        each list examined when starting transitions.  The lists are
        matched up from the first value: excess values at the end are
        not used.  If one of the other properties doesn't have enough
        comma-separated values to match the number of values of
        'transition-property', the UA must calculate its used value by
        repeating the list of values until there are enough.  This
        truncation or repetition does not affect the computed value.
        <span class="note">
          Note: This is analogous to the behavior of the 'background-*'
          properties, with 'background-image' analogous to
          'transition-property'.
        </span>
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <p style="display:none">
          Example(s):
        </p>
      <pre>
      div {
        transition-property: opacity, left, top, width;
        transition-duration: 2s, 1s;
      }
      </pre>The above example defines a transition on the 'opacity' property of 2 seconds duration, a
      transition on the 'left' property of 1
      second duration, a transition on the 'top' property of 2 seconds duration and a
      transition on the 'width' property of 1
      second duration.

      </div>

      <p>
        While authors can use transitions to create dynamically changing content,
        dynamically changing content can lead to seizures in some users.
        For information on how to avoid content that can lead to seizures, see
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#seizure">Guideline 2.3:

      <div class="prod">

      </div>

      <p>
        A value of ''none'' means that no property will transition.
        Otherwise, a list of properties to be transitioned, or the
        keyword ''all'' which indicates that all properties are to be
        transitioned, is given.
      </p>

      <p>
        If one of the identifiers listed is not a recognized property
        name or is not an animatable property, the implementation must
        still start transitions on the animatable properties in the
        list using the duration, delay, and timing function at their
        respective indices in the lists for 'transition-duration',
        'transition-delay', and 'transition-timing-function'.  In other
        words, unrecognized or non-animatable properties must be kept in
        the list to preserve the matching of indices.
      </p>

      <p>
        The keywords ''none'', ''inherit'', and ''initial'' are not
        permitted as items within a list of more that one identifier;
        any list that uses them is syntactically invalid.
        In other words, the &lt;IDENT&gt; production in
        <span>&lt;single-transition-property&gt;</span> matches any
        identifier other than these three keywords.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the keyword ''all'', or if one of the identifiers listed is a
        shorthand property, implementations must start transitions for
        any of its longhand sub-properties that are animatable (or, for
        ''all'', all animatable properties), using the duration, delay,
        and timing function at the index corresponding to the shorthand.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a property is specified multiple times in the value of
        'transition-property' (either on its own, via a shorthand that
        contains it, or via the ''all'' value), then the transition that
        starts uses the duration, delay, and timing function at the
        index corresponding to the <em>last</em> item in the value of
        'transition-property' that calls for animating that property.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note:  The ''all'' value and 'all' shorthand
        property work in similar ways, so the
        ''all'' value is just like a shorthand that
        covers all properties.

        This property specifies how long the transition from the old value to the new value should take. By default the value is ''0s'', meaning that the transition is immediate (i.e. there will be no animation). A negative value for 'transition-duration' renders the declaration invalid.

        The 'transition-timing-function' Property
      </a></h3>
      <p>
        The 'transition-timing-function' property
        describes how the intermediate values used during a transition will be
        calculated. It allows for a transition to change speed over its
        duration. These effects are commonly called <em>easing</em> functions.
        In either case, a mathematical function that provides a smooth curve is
        used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Timing functions are either defined as a stepping function or
        a <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Cubic_B.C3.A9zier_curves">cubic
        B&eacute;zier curve</a>.
        The timing function takes as its input
        the current elapsed percentage of the transition duration
        and outputs the percentage of the way the transition is
        from its start value to its end value.
        How this output is used is defined by
        the <a href="#animatable-types">interpolation rules</a>
        for the value type.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_function">stepping</a>
        function is defined by a number that divides the domain of operation
        into equally sized intervals. Each subsequent interval is a equal step
        closer to the goal state. The function also specifies whether the
        change in output percentage happens at the start or end of the
        interval (in other words, if 0% on the input percentage is the point
        of initial change).
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="step.png" alt="The step timing function splits
          the function domain into a number of disjoint straight line

          output value is 0 for all input values less than 1, and output
          is 1 for the input value of 1. steps(3, start) is a function that
          divides the input domain into three segments, each 1/3 in length,
          and 1/3 above the previous segment, with the first segment starting
          at 1/3. steps(3, end) is a function that

        can be set to preset values using the keywords listed below, or can be
        set to specific values using the ''cubic-bezier'' function.
        In the ''cubic-bezier'' function, P<sub>1</sub> and
        P<sub>2</sub> are each specified by both an X and Y value.

        The 'transition-delay' Property
      </a></h3>
      <p>
        The 'transition-delay' property defines when the transition will start. It allows a transition to begin execution some some period of time from when it is applied. A 'transition-delay' value of ''0s'' means the transition will execute as soon as the property is changed. Otherwise, the value specifies an offset from the moment the property is changed, and the transition will delay execution by that offset.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the value for 'transition-delay' is a negative time offset then the transition will execute the moment the property is changed, but will appear to have begun execution at the specified offset. That is, the transition will appear to begin part-way through its play cycle. In the case where a transition has implied starting values and a negative 'transition-delay', the starting values are taken from the moment the property is changed.

      <h2 id="starting">
        Starting of transitions
      </h2>

      <p>
        When the computed value of an animatable property changes,
        implementations must decide what transitions to start based on
        the values of the 'transition-property', 'transition-duration',
        'transition-timing-function', and 'transition-delay' properties
        at the time the animatable property would first have its new
        computed value.
        This means that when one of these 'transition-*' properties
        changes at the same time as
        a property whose change might transition,
        it is the <em>new</em> values of the 'transition-*' properties
        that control the transition.
      </p>
      <div class="example" id="manual-reversing-example">
        <p style="display:none">
          Example(s):
        </p>
        <p>This provides a way for authors to specify different values
        of the 'transition-*' properties for the &ldquo;forward&rdquo;
        and &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; transitions (but see <a
        href="#reversing">below</a> for special reversing behavior when
        an <em>incomplete</em> transition is interrupted).  Authors can
        specify the value of 'transition-duration',
        'transition-timing-function', or 'transition-delay' in the same
        rule where they specify the value that triggers the transition,
        or can change these properties at the same time as they change
        the property that triggers the transition.  Since it's the new
        values of these 'transition-*' properties that affect the
        transition, these values will be used for the transitions
        <em>to</em> the associated transitioning values.  For example:
         </p>
        <pre>li {
  transition: background-color linear 1s;
  background: blue;
}
li:hover {
  background-color: green;
  transition-duration: 2s; /* applies to the transition *to* the :hover state */
}</pre>
        <p>
          When a list item with these style rules enters the :hover
          state, the computed 'transition-duration' at the time that
          'background-color' would have its new value (''green'') is ''2s'',
          so the transition from ''blue'' to ''green'' takes 2 seconds.
          However, when the list item leaves the :hover state, the
          transition from ''green'' to ''blue'' takes 1 second.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Various things can cause the computed style of an element to change,
        or for an element to start or stop having computed style.
        (For the purposes of this specification,
        an element has computed style when it is in the document tree,
        and does not have computed style when it is not in the document tree.)
        These include
        insertion and removal of elements from the document tree
        (which both changes whether those elements have computed styles and
        can change the styles of other elements through selector matching),
        changes to the document tree that cause
        changes to which selectors match elements,
        changes to style sheets or style attributes,
        and other things.
        This specification does not define when computed styles are updated.
        However,
        when an implementation updates the computed style for an element
        to reflect one of these changes,
        it must update the computed style for all elements to reflect all
        of these changes at the same time
        (or at least it must be undetectable that it was done at a
        different time).
        This processing of a set of simultaneous style changes is called a
        <dfn>style change event</dfn>.
        (Implementations typically have a <span>style change event</span> to
        correspond with their desired screen refresh rate,
        and when up-to-date computed style is needed
        for a script API that depends on it.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Since this specification does not define
        when a <span>style change event</span> occurs,
        and thus what changes to computed values are considered simultaneous,
        authors should be aware that changing any of the transition
        properties a small amount of time after making a change that
        might transition can result in behavior that varies between
        implementations, since the changes might be considered
        simultaneous in some implementations but not others.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a <span>style change event</span> occurs,
        implementations must start transitions based on
        the computed styles that changed in that event.
        If an element does not have a computed style
        either before or after the style change event,
        then transitions are not started for that element
        in that style change event.
        Otherwise,
        define the <dfn>before-change style</dfn> as
        the computed style for the element as of
        the previous <span>style change event</span>,
        except with any styles derived from declarative
        animations such as CSS Transitions, CSS Animations
        ([[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]]),
        and SMIL Animations ([[SMIL-ANIMATION]], [[SVG11]])
        updated to the current time.
        Likewise, define the <dfn>after-change style</dfn> as
        the computed style for the element based on the information
        known at the start of that <span>style change event</span>,
        in other words,
        excluding any changes resulting from CSS Transitions
        that start during that <span>style change event</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
        This wording needs to handle already-running transitions better!
        Need to cancel a transition that hasn't moved yet when we're
        resetting to its start value!  Define canceling as not
        firing transition events.  And point to other occurrence of
        canceling in reversing section.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Note that this definition of the <span>after-change style</span>
          means that a single change
          can start a transition on the same property
          on both an ancestor element and its descendant element.
          This can happen when a property change is inherited
          from one element with 'transition-*' properties
          that say to animate the changing property
          to another element with 'transition-*' properties
          that also say to animate the changing property.
        </p>

        <p>
          When this happens, both transitions will run,
          and the transition on the descendant will override
          the transition on the ancestor
          because of the normal
          CSS cascading and inheritance rules ([[CSS3CASCADE]]).
        </p>

        <p>
          If the transition on the descendant completes before
          the transition on the ancestor,
          the descendant will then resume inheriting
          the (still transitioning) value from its parent.
          This effect is likely not a desirable effect,
          but it is essentially doing what the author asked for.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        For each element with a <span>before-change style</span> and
        an <span>after-change style</span>,
        and each property (other than shorthands) for which
        the <span>before-change style</span> is different from
        the <span>after-change style</span>,
        implementations must
        start transitions based on the relevant item (see <a
        href="#transition-property">the definition of
        'transition-property'</a>) in the computed value of
        'transition-property'.
        Corresponding to this item there is
        a <span>matching transition duration</span>,
        a <span>matching transition delay</span>, and
        a <span>matching transition timing function</span>
        in the computed values of
        'transition-duration', 'transition-delay', and 'transition-timing-function'
        (see <a href="#list-matching">the rules on matching lists</a>).
        Define the <dfn>combined duration</dfn> of the transition
        as the sum of max(matching transition duration, ''0s'') and
        the matching transition-delay.
        When the combined duration is greater than ''0s'',
        then a transition starts based on the values of the
        matching transition duration, the matching transition delay,
        and the matching transition-timing-function;
        in other cases transitions do not occur.
        The <dfn>start time</dfn> of this transition is defined as
        the time of the <span>style change event</span> plus
        the matching transition delay.
        The <dfn>end time</dfn> of this transition is defined as
        the <span>start time</span> plus the matching transition duration.
        The <dfn>start value</dfn> of this transition is defined as
        the value of the transitioning property
        in the <span>before-change style</span>,
        and the <dfn>end value</dfn> of this transition is defined as
        the value of the transitioning property
        in the <span>after-change style</span>.
        Except in the cases described
        in the <a href="#reversing">section on reversing of
        transitions</a>,
        the <dfn>reversing-adjusted start value</dfn> is the same as
        the <span>start value</span>,
        and the <dfn>reversing shortening factor</dfn> is 1.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the transition of a property has started, it must continue
        running based on the original timing function, duration, and
        delay, even if the 'transition-timing-function',
        'transition-duration', or 'transition-delay' property changes
        before the transition is complete.  However, if the
        'transition-property' property changes such that the transition
        would not have started, the transition must stop (and the
        property must immediately change to its final value).
      </p>

      <p>
        Implementations must not start a transition when the computed
        value of a property changes as a result of declarative animation
        (as opposed to scripted animation).
      </p>

      <p>
        Implementations also must not start a transition when the
        computed value changes because it is inherited (directly or
        indirectly) from another element that is transitioning the same
        property.
      </p>

      <h3 id="reversing">
        Faster reversing of interrupted transitions
      </h3>
      <p>
        Many common transitions effects involve transitions between two states,
        such as the transition that occurs when the mouse pointer moves
        over a user interface element, and then later moves out of that element.
        With these effects, it is common for a running transition
        to be interrupted before it completes,
        and the property reset to the starting value of that transition.
        An example is a hover effect on an element,
        where a transition starts when the pointer enters the element,
        and then the pointer exits the element before the effect has completed.
        If the outgoing and incoming transitions
        are executed using their specified durations and timing functions,
        the resulting effect can be distractingly asymmetric
        because the second transition
        takes the full specified time to move a shortened distance.
        Instead, the expected behavior is that the second transition is shorter.
      </p>

      <p>
        To meet this expectation,
        when a transition is started for a property on an element
        (henceforth, the <dfn>new transition</dfn>)
        that has a currently-running transition whose
        <span>reversing-adjusted start value</span> is the same as the
        <span>end value</span> of the new transition
        (henceforth, the <dfn>old transition</dfn>), implementations
        must cancel the old transition <span class="issue">link to
        definition above</span> and adjust the new transition as follows
        (prior to following the rules for computing the <span>combined
        duration</span>, <span>start time</span>, and <span>end
        time</span>):
      </p>

      <ol>

        <li>
          The <span>reversing-adjusted start value</span> of the new
          transition is instead the the <span>end value</span> of the
          old transition.
          <span class="note">Note: This represents the logical start state of
          the transition, and allows some calculations to ignore that
          the transition started before that state was reached, which
          in turn allows repeated reversals of the same transition to
          work correctly.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          The <span>reversing shortening factor</span> of the new
          transition is the absolute value, clamped to the range [0, 1],
          of the sum of:
          <ol>
            <li>the output of the timing function of the old transition
            at the time of the <span>style change event</span>,
            times the <span>reversing shortening factor</span> of the
            old transition</li>
            <li>1 minus the <span>reversing shortening factor</span> of
            the old transition.</li>
          </ol>
          <span class="note">Note: This represents the portion of the
          space between the <span>reversing-adjusted start value</span>
          and the <span>end value</span> that the old transition has
          traversed (in amounts of the value, not time), except with the
          absolute value and clamping to handle timing functions that
          have y1 or y2 outside the range [0, 1].</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          The matching transition-duration for the new transition is
          multiplied by the
          <span>reversing shortening factor</span>.
        </li>

        <li>
          If the matching transition-delay for the new transition is
          negative, it is also multiplied by the
          <span>reversing shortening factor</span>.
        </li>

      </ol>

      <p class="note">
        Note that these rules do not fully address the problem for
        transition patterns that involve more than two states.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Note that these rules lead to the entire timing function of the
        new transition being used, rather than jumping into the middle
        of a timing function, which can create a jarring effect.

        (that is, when or after the transition has started and before the

        When interpolating between two values,
        <var>V</var><sub>start</sub> and <var>V</var><sub>end</sub>,
        interpolation is done using the output <var>p</var> of the timing function,
        which gives the portion of the value space
        that the interpolation has crossed.
        Thus the result of the interpolation is
        <var>V</var><sub>res</sub> =
          (1 - <var>p</var>) &sdot; <var>V</var><sub>start</sub> +
          <var>p</var> &sdot; <var>V</var><sub>end</sub>.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if this value (<var>V</var><sub>res</sub>)
        is outside the allowed range of values for the property,
        then it is clamped to that range.
        This can occur if <var>p</var> is outside of the range 0 to 1,
        which can occur if a timing function is specified

          values of the timing function (which occur only at the
          start/end of the transition or as a result of ''cubic-bezier()''

          The result list has a length that is the least common multiple
          of the lengths of the input lists.
          Each item in the result is the interpolation of the value
          from each input list repeated to the length of the result list.
          If a pair of values cannot be interpolated, then the lists
          are not interpolable.

            The repeatable list concept ensures that a list that is
            conceptually repeated to a certain length (as
            'background-origin' is repeated to the length of the
            'background-image' list) or repeated infinitely will
            smoothly transition between any values, and so that the
            computed value will properly represent the result (and
            potentially be inherited correctly).

      <p>Future specifications may define additional types that can

      <p>See the definition of 'transition-property' for how animation
      of shorthand properties and the ''all'' value is applied to any
      properties (in the shorthand) that can be animated.</p>

      <!--
      As resolved in
      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Sep/0497.html
      -->

      <p>The definition of each CSS property defines
      when the values of that property can be interpolated
      by referring to the definitions of property types
      in the <a href="#animatable-types">previous section</a>.
      Values are animatable when
      both the from and the to values of the property have the type described.
      (When a composite type such as "length, percentage, or calc" is listed,
      this means that both values must fit into that composite type.)
      When multiple types are listed in the form "either A or B",
      both values must be of the same type to be interpolable.</p>

      <p>For properties that exist at the time this specification was
      developed, this specification defines whether and how they are
      animated.  However, future CSS specifications may define
      additional properties, additional values for existing properties,
      or additional animation behavior of existing values.  In order to
      describe new animation behaviors and to have the definition of
      animation behavior in a more appropriate location, future CSS
      specifications should include an "Animatable:" line in the summary
      of the property's definition (in addition to the other lines
      described in [[CSS21]], <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">section
      1.4.2</a>).  This line should say "no" to indicate that a property
      cannot be animated or should reference an animation behavior
      (which may be one of the behaviors in the <a
      href="#animation-of-property-types-">Animation of property
      types</a> section above, or may be a new behavior) to define how
      the property animates.  Such definitions override those given in
      this specification.</p>

      <p>
      The following definitions define the animation behavior for
      properties in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 ([[CSS21]]) and in Level 3 of
      the CSS Color Module ([[CSS3COLOR]]).

<h2 id="changes">Changes since Working Draft of 19 November 2013</h2>

<p>The following are the substantive changes made since the

dated 19 November 2013</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The transitionend event is no longer cancelable.  This is since it has no default action, so canceling it would have no meaning.  It also matches the animation events.</p>
