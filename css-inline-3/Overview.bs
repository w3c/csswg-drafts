Abstract: The CSS formatting model provides for a flow of elements and text inside of a container to be wrapped into lines.  The formatting of elements and text within a line, its positioning in the inline progression direction, and the breaking of lines are described in [[CSS-TEXT-3]].  This module describes the positioning in the block progression direction both of elements and text within lines and of the lines themselves.  This positioning is often relative to a baseline.  It also describes special features for formatting of first lines and drop caps.  It extends on the model in [[CSS2]].
Ignored Terms: line-height-shift-adjustment, text-script, after, before, alignment subtree
Link Defaults: css-fonts-3 (property) font-family, css-color-3 (property) color
At Risk: the 'initial-letters-wrap' property

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	This module defines the CSS Inline Layout model,
	replacing and extending the model as defined in CSS2.1.
	It is very much a work-in-progress, and implementers should reference CSS2.1 for now.

	The <dfn export>root inline box</dfn> is an anonymous inline box
	which is automatically generated to hold
	all of the <a>inline-level</a> contents of a <a>block container</a>
	(if it has any).
	It inherits from its parent <a>block container</a>,
	but is otherwise unstyleable.

	Note: Line boxes, like <a>column boxes</a> [[css-multicol-1]],
	are <a>fragmentation containers</a> generated by their <a>formatting context</a>
	and are not part of the CSS <a>box tree</a>.

	ISSUE: Many aspects of layout here depend on font metrics.
	While the relevant metrics exist in OpenType for Latin/Cyrillic/Greek and for CJK,
	they are missing for many other writing systems.
	For example, the visual top metric for Hebrew has no metric in the OpenType tables.
	For this module to work well for the world,
	we need fonts to provide the relevant metrics for all writing systems,
	and that means both that OpenType needs to allow such metrics
	and font designers need to provide accurate numbers.

<h2 id="line-height">
Line Heights and Baseline Alignment</h2>

	<p class="issue">This section is being rewritten. Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#line-height">section 10.8</a> of [[CSS2]] for the normative CSS definition or the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-linebox-20020515/">2002 Working Draft</a> if you want pretty pictures. (But ignore the old text, half of it's wrong. We're not specifying which half, that's to be determined.)
	<strong>The CSS2 specification should be used as the guideline for implementation.</strong></p>

	Issue: The CSSWG would like to know which baseline values are necessary: if any can be dropped, or any need to be added. See GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/859">859</a>.

<h3 id="dominant-baseline-property">
Dominant Baselines: the 'dominant-baseline' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: dominant-baseline
	Value: auto | text-bottom | alphabetic | ideographic | middle | central | mathematical | hanging | text-top
	Initial: normal
	Applies to: block containers, inline boxes, table rows, table columns, grid containers, and flex containers
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: specified keyword
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	This property specifies the <dfn>dominant baseline</dfn>,
	which is the baseline used to align the box's text and inline-level contents.
	It is also indicates the default <a>alignment baseline</a>
	of any boxes participating in <a>baseline alignment</a>
	in the box’s <a>alignment context</a>.
	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=dominant-baseline dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''dominant-baseline/alphabetic'' in <a>horizontal writing modes</a>
			and in <a>vertical writing modes</a>
			when 'text-orientation' is ''sideways'', ''sideways-right'', or ''sideways-left''.
			Equivalent to ''dominant-baseline/central'' in <a>vertical writing modes</a>
			when 'text-orientation' is ''mixed'' or ''upright''.

			However, in SVG text, the origin point of glyphs
			(used for coordinate-based glyph positioning)
			is always handled as for ''dominant-baseline/central''
			in <a>vertical writing modes</a>.

		<dt><dfn>text-bottom</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the bottom of the em box as the baseline.

		<dt><dfn>alphabetic</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the alphabetic baseline.

		<dt><dfn>ideographic</dfn>
		<dd>
			Match the box's ideographic under-side baseline to that of its parent.
			This corresponds to the <code>ideo</code> baseline in OpenType.

		<dt><dfn>middle</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the “middle” baseline: halfway between the alphabetic baseline and the ex-height.

		<dt><dfn>central</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the central baseline
			(halfway between the ascent and descent).

		<dt><dfn>mathematical</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the mathematical baseline.

		<dt><dfn>hanging</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the hanging baseline.

		<dt><dfn>text-top</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the top of the em box as the baseline.
	</dl>

	See [[CSS-WRITING-MODES-3]] for an introduction to dominant baselines.

	Issue: Should be text-over and text-under instead of text-top and text-bottom,
	but maybe it's better not to use those terms for consistency with legacy 'vertical-align'.
	See GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/860">860</a>.

	Issue: Add <css>first</css> and <css>last</css> values.
	Note, in this property, these are combinatorial,
	whereas in the <css>align/justify-self/content</css> properties, it's singular.
	Do we want to align the syntaxes wrt hyphens vs. spaces or what?
	See GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/861">861</a>.

<h3 id="transverse-alignment">
Transverse Box Alignment: the 'vertical-align' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef shorthand">
	Name: vertical-align
	Value: <<'baseline-shift'>> || <<'alignment-baseline'>>
	Initial: baseline
	Applies to: inline-level boxes
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: N/A
	</pre>

	<p>This shorthand property specifies how an inline-level box is aligned within the line.
	Values are the same as for its longhand properties, see below.

	<p class="advisement">
		Authors should use this property ('vertical-align') instead of its longhands.

	ISSUE: This property will gain ''first'' and ''last'' keywords,
	like in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/">box alignment properties</a>,
	see [[css-align-3#baseline-values]].
	The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/861">open question</a>
	is whether they should be added to 'alignment-baseline'
	or a new <a>sub-property</a> should be created
	to hold the ''first | last'' preference.

<h4 id="alignment-baseline-property">
Alignment Point: 'alignment-baseline' longhand</h4>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: alignment-baseline
	Value: baseline | text-bottom | alphabetic | ideographic | middle | central | mathematical | text-top | bottom | center | top
	Initial: baseline
	Applies to: inline-level boxes, flex items, grid items, table cells
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: specified keyword
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	<p>Specifies what point of an inline-level box is aligned to what point in the parent.
	Also selects the <a>alignment baseline</a> of boxes aligned with 'align-self'/'justify-self'.

	ISSUE: Clean up this prose to correctly handle alignment contexts other than inline formatting contexts.

	Values are defined below:

	For the following definitions,
	the margin box is used for atomic inlines,
	the leading box for non-replaced inlines,
	and the baselines of the box are <a lt="synthesized baseline">synthesized</a> if missing in the line-box's inline axis:

	<dl dfn-for=alignment-baseline dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>baseline</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the <a>dominant baseline</a> choice of the parent.
			Match the box's corresponding baseline to that of its parent.

		<dt><dfn>text-bottom</dfn>
		<dd>
			Match the bottom of the box to the bottom of the parent's content area.

		<dt><dfn>alphabetic</dfn>
		<dd>
			Match the box's alphabetic baseline to that of its parent.

		<dt><dfn>ideographic</dfn>
		<dd>
			Match the box's ideographic character face under-side baseline to that of its parent.

		<dt><dfn>middle</dfn>
		<dd>
			Align the vertical midpoint of the box with
			the baseline of the parent box plus half the x-height of the parent.

		<dt><dfn>central</dfn>
		<dd>
			Match the box's central baseline to the central baseline of its parent.

		<dt><dfn>mathematical</dfn>
		<dd>
			Match the box's mathematical baseline to that of its parent.

		<dt><dfn>text-top</dfn>
		<dd>
			Match the top of the box to the top of the parent's content area.
	</dl>

	For the following definitions, the <a>alignment subtree</a>
	is as defined in [[!CSS2]].

	<dl dfn-for=alignment-baseline dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>top</dfn>
		<dd>
			Align the top of the aligned subtree with the top of the line box.

		<dt><dfn>center</dfn>
		<dd>
			Align the center of the aligned subtree with the center of the line box.

		<dt><dfn>bottom</dfn>
		<dd>
			Align the bottom of the aligned subtree with the bottom of the line box.
	</dl>

	SVG implementations <em>may</em> support the following aliases
	in order to support legacy content:
	<pre dfn-for=alignment-baseline dfn-type=value>
		<dfn>text-before-edge</dfn> = ''alignment-baseline/text-top''
		<dfn>text-after-edge</dfn> = ''alignment-baseline/text-bottom''
	</pre>
	These values are not allowed in the 'vertical-align' shorthand.

<h4 id="baseline-shift-property">
Alignment Shift: the 'baseline-shift' longhand</h4>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: baseline-shift
	Value: <<length-percentage>> | sub | super
	Initial: 0
	Applies to: inline-level boxes, flex items, grid items
	<!-- table cells left out b/c CSS2.1 vertical-align values must have no effect... -->
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: refer to the used value of 'line-height'
	Computed value: the specified keyword and/or a computed <<length-percentage>> value
	</pre>

	<p>This property specifies by how much the box is shifted up
	from its alignment point.
	It does not apply when 'alignment-baseline' is ''alignment-baseline/top'' or ''alignment-baseline/bottom''.

	<p class="advisement">
		Authors should use the 'vertical-align' shorthand instead of this property.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for="baseline-shift" dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn><<length>></dfn>
		<dd>Raise (positive value) or lower (negative value) by the specified length.

		<dt><dfn><<percentage>></dfn>
		<dd>Raise (positive value) or lower (negative value) by the specified percentage of the 'line-height'.

		<dt><dfn>sub</dfn>
		<dd>Lower by the offset appropriate for subscripts of the parent’s box.
		(The UA should use the parent’s font data to find this offset whenever possible.)

		<dt><dfn>super</dfn>
		<dd>Raise by the offset appropriate for superscripts of the parent’s box.
		(The UA should use the parent’s font data to find this offset whenever possible.)
	</dl>

	<p>User agents <em>may</em> additionally support the keyword <dfn for=baseline-shift>baseline</dfn>
	as computing to ''0''
	if is necessary for them to support legacy SVG content.

	Issue: We would prefer to remove this, and are looking for feedback from SVG user agents as to whether it's necessary.

<h3 id="line-height-property">
Line Spacing: the 'line-height' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: line-height

	</dl>

	ISSUE: Fill out this definition so that it fully replaces CSS2.

	ISSUE: The fact that percentages compute to lengths is annoying.

<h3 id="line-sizing-property">
Line Sizing Containment: the 'line-sizing' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: line-sizing
	Value: legacy | normal
	Initial: legacy
	Applies to: inline boxes
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: the specified keyword
	</pre>

	ISSUE: This is a rought draft of a proposal, and has not yet been approved by the CSSWG.
	See discussion in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3199">Issue 3199</a>, <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Mar/0364.html">Hyatt's message</a>, and <a href="https://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/csswg/css3-linebox/Attic/Overview.html?rev=1.5;content-type=text%2Fhtml#LineStacking">dbaron's proposal</a>.

	This property controls the method by which line boxes are sized,
	and thus the spacing between lines of text.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=line-sizing dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>legacy</dfn>
		<dd>
			The inline box contributes to the sizing of its line box
			based on its 'line-height',
			rather than based on its box edges,
			as defined in [[!CSS2]].
			In Quirks Mode [[!QUIRKS]],
			any <a>inline box</a> <a lt="box fragment">fragment</a>
			that has zero borders and padding and
			that does not directly contain text or <a>preserved white space</a> [[!CSS-TEXT-3]]
			is ignored when sizing the line box.

			Note: In this model, vertical rhythm is broken
			any time there is a change in font metrics within a paragraph.

		<dt><dfn>normal</dfn>
		<dd>
			The inline box contributes to the sizing of its line box
			based on its <a>margin box</a>,
			rather than its 'line-height'.
			Half-leading is inserted inside the <a>content box</a> edges,
			rather than overlapping the padding/border/margin areas.
			However, positive half-leading is only applied to the <a>root inline box</a>.
			Negative half-leading is applied to all inline boxes,-
			reducing the size of the <a>content box</a> as needed.

			Note: This will give consistent line spacing
			as long as there is some amount of leading added,
			such that the half-leading on the root inline
			is large enough to accommodate the unleaded ascent/descent of its descendants.
			The line box will grow, however, to accommodate
			content that would otherwise overflow,
			to avoid overlap between lines.
	</dl>

	ISSUE: Should this property apply to block containers or to inline boxes?
	In the latter case, an individual inline could say "pay attention to me"
	or "don't pay attention to me".

<h3 id="leading-trim-property">
Leading Control: the 'leading-trim-over' and 'leading-trim-under' properties and 'leading-trim' shorthand</h3>

	ISSUE: This is a rought draft of a proposal,
	and is likely to change significantly
	as design critiques and use cases are registered.
	Values and property names may be added, dropped, and/or renamed,
	and the overall syntax or behavior may change.
	Do not implement (yet).
	The CSSWG particularly invites feedback on
	which font metrics need corresponding keyword values.

	To ensure consistent spacing in the basic case of running text,
	CSS line layout introduces leading both above and below
	the text content of each line.
	In addition, the ascend and descent font metrics themselves
	include extra space above and below the most common glyph sizes
	in order to accommodate occasional characters and diacritics
	which ascend or descend beyond the typical bounds.
	This prevents subsequent lines of text from overlapping each other.
	However, all this extra spacing interferes with visual alignment
	and with control over effective (visually-apparent) spacing.

	The 'leading-trim' properties allow controlling the spacing above and below
	the first and last lines of a block.
	It allows precise control over spacing;
	moreover, by relying on font metrics rather than hard-coded lengths,
	it allows content to be resized, rewrapped, and rendered in a variety of fonts
	while maintaining that spacing.

	<div class="example">
		<!-- Example from Weston Thayer in https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3240#issuecomment-432375650 -->

		A common problem is vertical centering.
		It's easy to vertically center the text container to an icon,
		but because the visual boundaries of Latin text
		are the cap height and the alphabetic baseline,
		rather than the ascent and descent,
		this often doesn't yield the intended visual effect.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/leading-trim-centering-fail.png"
			     alt="Consider some Latin text placed to the right of an image,
			          to be centered between its top and bottom.
			          Measuring from the top of the image to the top of the text box yields 13px;
			          likewise measuring from the bottom of the image to the bottom of the text box yelds 13px,
			          theoretically perfectly centering the text.
			          However, measuring from the top of the image to the cap-height yields 21px;
			          and measuring from the bottom to the alphabetic baseline yields 19px,
			          showing that visually the text is not actually centered.">
			<figcaption>
				Measuring to the top/bottom of the text may yield equal results,
				but measuring to the visual bounds shows that it is not visually centered.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		To center the text visually,
		it's necessary to asume the cap height and alphabetic baseline
		as the top and bottom edges of the text,
		respectively.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/leading-trim-centering-goal.png"
			     alt="If the text were visually centered,
			          the distance between the top of the image and the cap height would be 20px,
			          and the distance between the bottom of the image and the alphabetic baseline would be equally 20px."
			     style="width: 50%">
			<figcaption>
				Measuring to the cap height / alphabetic baseline
				instead of the ascent / descent
				and equalizing those distances
				visually centers the text.
		</figure>

		By using 'leading-trim' to strip out the spacing above the cap height
		and below the alphabetic baseline,
		centering the box actually centers the text;
		and does so reliably, regardless of what font is used to render it.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/leading-trim-centering-variants.gif"
			     alt="">
			<figcaption>
				Even though different fonts have different cap heights,
				by using the font's metric rather than a magic number,
				the layout intention is met even as the font is changed.
			</figcaption>

An Introduction to Initial Letters</h3>

	<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

	Large, decorative letters have been used to start new sections of text since before the invention of printing.
	In fact, their use predates lowercase letters entirely.

<h4 id="drop-initial">
Drop Initial</h4>

	A <dfn>dropped initial</dfn> (or “drop cap”)
	is a larger-than-usual letter at the start of a paragraph,
	with a baseline at least one line lower than the first baseline of the paragraph.
	The size of the drop initial is usually indicated by how many lines it occupies.
	Two- and three-line drop initials are very common.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/Dropcap-E-acute-3line.png" width="480"
		     alt="3-line drop cap with E Acute"  >
		<figcaption>
			Three-line drop initial with E acute.
			Since the cap-height of the drop initial aligns with the cap-height of the main text,
			the accent extends above the paragraph.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	The exact size and position of a <a>dropped initial</a>
	depends on the alignment of its glyph.
	Reference points on the drop cap must align precisely
	with reference points in the text.
	The alignment constraints for drop initials depend on the writing system.

	In Western scripts, the top reference points are
	the cap height of the initial letter and of the first line of text.
	The bottom reference points are
	the alphabetic baseline of the initial letter
	and the baseline of the Nth line of text.
	<a href="#f2">Figure 2</a> shows a simple two-line drop cap, with the relevant reference lines marked.

	<figure id="f2">

		     alt="drop cap showing alignment">
		<figcaption>Two-line drop cap showing baselines (green lines), cap-height (red line), and ascender (cyan line).</figcaption>
	</figure>

	In Han-derived scripts, the initial letter extends
	from the <a>block-start</a> edge of the glyphs on the first line
	to the <a>block-end</a> edge of the glyphs on the Nth line.

		<img src="images/Initial-2line-JapaneseVertical六.png" width="480"
		     alt="Japanese Vertical Initial">
		<figcaption>Two-line drop initial in vertical writing mode</figcaption>
	</figure>

	In certain Indic scripts,
	the top alignment point	is the hanging baseline,
	and the bottom alignment point is the text-after-edge.

	</figure>


<h4 id="sunk-initial">
Sunken Initial Letters</h4>

	Some styles of drop initials do not align with the first line of text.
	A <dfn>sunken initial</dfn> (or “sunken cap”)
	both sinks below the first baseline,
	and extends above the first line of text.

		     alt="sunken drop initial">
		<figcaption>Sunken cap. The letter drops two lines, but is the size of a three-line initial letter.</figcaption>
	</figure>

<h4 id="raise-initial">
Raised Initial Letters</h4>

	A <dfn>raised initial</dfn> (often called a “raised cap” or “stick-up cap”) “sinks” to the first text baseline.

	Note: A proper raised initial has several advantages over
	simply increasing the font size of a first letter.
	The line spacing in the rest of the paragraph will not be altered,
	but text will still be excluded around large descenders.
	And if the size of raised initial is defined to be an integral number of lines,
	implicit baseline grids can be maintained.

	</figure>

<h3 id="selecting-drop-initials">
Selecting Initial Letters</h3>

	<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

	Initial letters are typically a single letter, although
	they may include punctuation or a sequence of characters which
	are perceived by the user to be a single typographic unit.
	The ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element,
	defined in [[SELECT]] and [[CSS-PSEUDO-4]],
	can be used to select the character(s) to be formatted as <a>initial letters</a>.

	Authors who need more control over which characters are included in an initial letter,
	or who want to apply initial-letters formatting to replaced elements or multiple words
	can alternately apply the 'initial-letters' property to the first inline-level child of a block container.

	<div class="example">
	<pre>
		&lt;p>This paragraph has a dropped “T”.
		&lt;p>&lt;img alt="H" src="illuminated-h.svg">ere we have an illuminated “H”.
		&lt;p>&lt;span>Words may also&lt;/span> be given initial letter styling at the beginning of a paragraph.
	</pre>

	<pre>
		::first-letter, /* style first paragraph's T */
		img, /* style illuminated H */
		span /* style phrase inside span */
		{ initial-letters: 2; }
	</pre>
	</div>

	Note that
	since ''::first-letter'' selects punctuation before or after the first letter,
	these characters are included in the initial-letters when ''::first-letter'' is used.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/initial-letter-punctuation-quote.png" width="604"
		     alt="Paragraph showing both opening quote and first letter set as three-line drop cap">
		<figcaption>The ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element selects the quotation mark as well as the “M”.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	Issue: Should there be a way to opt out of this behavior? See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/310">Github Issue 310</a>.

<h3 id="sizing-drop-initials">
Creating Initial Letters: the 'initial-letters' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">

	Inherited: no
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: the keyword ''initial-letters/normal'' or a number paired with an integer

	</pre>

	ISSUE: Renaming this property (and the others in this section)
	is currently <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2950">under discussion</a>.

	This property specifies
	the <a lt="initial letter size">size</a> and <a lt="initial letter sink">sink</a>
	for dropped, raised, and sunken initial letters
	as the number of lines spanned.

	<div class="example">
		For example, the following code will create
		a 2-line dropped initial letter
		at the beginning of each paragraph
		that immediately follows a second-level heading:
		<pre>h2 + p::first-letter { initial-letters: 2; }</pre>
	</div>

	It takes the following values:

	<dl dfn-for=initial-letters dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>normal</dfn>
		<dd>
			No special initial-letters effect. Text behaves as normal.

		<dt><dfn><<number>></dfn>
		<dd>
			This first argument defines the <dfn dfn lt="initial letter size">size</dfn>
			of the initial letter
			in terms of how many lines it occupies.
			Values less than one are invalid.

		<dt><dfn><<integer>></dfn>
		<dd>
			This optional second argument 
			defines the number of lines the initial letter should
			<dfn dfn lt="initial letter sink" local-lt="sink">sink</dfn>.
			A value of ''1'' indicates a <a>raised initial</a>;
			values greater than ''1'' indiciate a <a>sunken initial</a>.
			Values less than one are invalid.

		<dt><dfn>raise</dfn>
		<dd>
			Computes to an <a>initial letter sink</a> of ''1''.

		<dt><dfn>drop</dfn>
		<dd>
			Computes to an <a>initial letter sink</a>
			equal to the <a>initial letter size</a>
			floored to the nearest positive whole number.
	</dl>

	If the <a>initial letter sink</a> value is omitted,
	''drop'' is assumed.

	Values other than ''initial-letters/normal''
	cause the affected box to become an
	<dfn lt="initial letter | initial letter box">initial letter box</dfn>,
	which is an <a>in-flow</a> <a>inline-level box</a>
	with special layout behavior.

	<div class="example">
		Here are some examples of 'initial-letters' usage:

			<dt>''initial-letters: 3 3''
			<dt>''initial-letters: 3 drop''
			<dt>''initial-letters: drop 3''

				     alt="3 lines high, 1 line deep">

			<dt>''initial-letters: 2.51 3''
			<dd>
				The size of the initial letter does not have to be an integral number of lines.
				In this case only the bottom aligns.

	</div>
	
	<div class="example">
		In conjunction with other CSS properties, ''initial-letters'' can be used to create
		“adjacent initial letters,” where the initial letter is adjacent to the text:

<h4 id="first-most-inline-level">
Applicability</h4>

	To give authors more control over which characters can be styled as an <a>initial letter</a>
	and to allow the possibility of multi-character <a>initial letters</a>
	(such as for first word or first phrase styling),
	the 'initial-letters' property applies not just
	to the CSS-defined ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element,
	but also to
	''list-style-position/inside''-positioned ''::marker'' pseudo-elements and
	inline-level boxes
	that are placed at the start of the first line.
	Specifically, 'initial-letters' applies to
	any <a>inline-level box</a>--
	including any such ''::first-letter'' or ''::marker'' box--
	that is the first child of its parent box
	and whose ancestors (if any) that are descendants of its <a>containing block</a>
	are all first-child <a>inline boxes</a>
	that have a <a lt="computed value">computed</a> 'initial-letters' value
	of ''initial-letters/normal''.

	<div class="example">
		For example,
		the <code>&lt;span></code>, <code>&lt;em></code>, and <code>&lt;b></code> elements
		in the following example are
		"first-most inline-level descendants" of the <code>&lt;p></code>,
		but the <code>&lt;strong></code> element
		is not:
		
		<xmp>
			<p><span><em><b>This</b> phrase</em> is styled
			<strong>specially</strong>.</span> …
		</xmp>
		
		If we apply the following rules:
		
		<pre>
			em { initial-letters: 2; }
			b, strong { initial-letters: 3; }
		</pre>
		
		The 'initial-letters' property will take effect only on the <code>&lt;em></code>.
		The styling on <code>&lt;b></code>
		is ignored,
		as it has an ancestor already styled as an <a>initial letter</a>;
		and the styling on <code>&lt;strong></code> is ignored
		because it is a second sibling.

		The result might be rendered as
		
		<figure>
			<img src="images/firstmost-inline.png"
			     alt="“This phrase” becomes the dropped text spanning two lines, the remainder of the text wrapping alongside.">
		</figure>
	</div>

	If 'initial-letters' is applied to an <a>inline-level box</a>
	that is not positioned at the start of the line due to bidi reordering
	or which is otherwise preceded by other <a>inline-level</a> content,
	its <a>used value</a> is ''initial-letters/normal'',
	and it is not formatted as an <a>initial letter</a>.

	The effect of the 'initial-letters' property is undefined
	on children of <a>ruby</a> base container boxes
	and on <a>ruby</a> container boxes.

	Note: The 'initial-letters' property cannot apply to any element
	whose 'float' is not ''float/none'' or 'position' is not ''static'',
	because these values cause its 'display' to compute to ''display/block''.

<h3 id="aligning-initial-letter">
Alignment of Initial Letters: the 'initial-letters-align' property</h3>

	As mentioned earlier, the alignment of initial letters
	depends on the script used.
	The 'initial-letters-align' property can be used to specify the proper alignment.

	<pre class="propdef" id="initial-letters-align">
	Name: <dfn id="propdef-initial-letters-align">initial-letters-align</dfn>
	Value: border-box? [ alphabetic | ideographic | hebrew | hanging ] | border-box
	Initial: alphabetic
	Applies to: certain inline-level boxes and <css>::first-letter</css> and inside <css>::marker</css> boxes (<a href="#first-most-inline-level">see prose</a>)
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: specified keyword(s)
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	This property specifies the alignment points
	used to size and position an <a>initial letter</a>.
	Two sets of alignment points are necessary:
	the <a>over</a> and <a>under</a> alignment points of the <a>initial letter</a>
	are matched to corresponding <a>over</a> and <a>under</a> points of the surrounding text.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-type="value" dfn-for="initial-letters-align">
		<dt><dfn>alphabetic</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the alphabetic and cap-height baselines of the surrounding text
			to align the <a>initial letter</a>.

		<dt><dfn>ideographic</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the ideographic character face bottom and top edge baselines of the surrounding text
			to align the <a>initial letter</a>.

		<dt><dfn>hebrew</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the alphabetic and (as yet theoretical) hebrew hanging baseline of the surrounding text
			to align the <a>initial letter</a>.

		<dt><dfn>hanging</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the alphabetic and hanging baselines of the surrounding text
			to align the <a>initial letter</a>.

		<dt><dfn>border-box</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the <a>initial letter box</a>’s <a>line-over</a> and <a>line-under</a> border edges
			as the <a>over</a> and <a>under</a> alignment points, respectively.
	</dl>

	Issue: Is there a proper typographic term for the hebrew “hanging” baseline?

	<div class="example">
		The vertical writing mode example from <a href="#f2">Figure 2</a> could be coded as:

		<pre>
			span.initial {
			  initial-letters: 2;
			  initial-letters-align: ideographic;
			}
		</pre>
	</div>



	<div class="example">
		Initial letter in Hebrew
		<pre>
			span.initial {
			initial-letters: 2;
			initial-letters-align: hebrew;
			}
		</pre>
		<img src="images/hebrew-initial-letter.png" width="480"
		     alt="optical kerning in the presence or absence of a space after the initial letter">
	</div>

	Except when ''border-box'' is specified,
	the alignment points of the <a>initial letter</a>
	are automatically determined from its contents:

		<ol>
			<li>If the <a>initial letter</a>
			is an atomic inline,
			use its <a>over</a> and <a>under</a> content-box edges.

			<li>Else if the <a>initial letter</a>
			contains any character from the Han, Hangul, Kana, or Yi <a>Unicode scripts</a>,
			use the ideographic character face bottom and top edge baselines.

			<li>Else if the <a>initial letter</a>
			contains any character from the Devanagari, Bengali, and Gurmukhi <a>Unicode scripts</a>,
			use the hanging and alphabetic baselines.

			<li>Else if the <a>initial letter</a>
			contains any character from the Hebrew <a>Unicode scripts</a>,
			use the ideographic character face bottom and top edge baselines.

			<li>Else use the alphabetic and cap-height baselines.
		</ol>

	Issue: What is the proper alignment for South Asian scripts
	that do not have the explicit hanging baseline, such as Tamil or Telugu?
	See GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/864">864</a>

	Note: The ordering of keywords in this property is fixed in case ''border-box''
	is expanded to ''[ border-box | alphabetic | ideographic | hebrew | hanging ]''
	to allow explicitly specifying the <a>initial letter</a>’s alignment points.

<h4 id="initial-letter-align-defaults">
UA Default Stylesheet for 'initial-letters-align'</h4>

	In order to provide the better behavior by default,
	UAs must include in their default UA style sheet the following rules:

	<pre>
		[lang]:lang(zh, ja, ko, ii) {
		  initial-letters-align: ideographic;
		}
		[lang]:lang(iw, yi, lad, jrb) {
		  initial-letters-align: hebrew;
		}
		[lang]:lang(hi, mr, ne, pi, kok, brx, mai, sd, sa) {
		  initial-letters-align: hanging;
		}
		/* Script tags override language tags */
		[lang]:lang('*-Latn', '*-Cyrl') {
		  initial-letters-align: alphabetic;
		}
		[lang]:lang('*-Hani', '*-Hant', '*-Hans') {
		  initial-letters-align: ideographic;
		}
	</pre>

	Issue: This only covers the most common cross-linguistic transcription systems.
	Should we include any other / all script tags in the UA style sheet?

<h3 id="initial-letter-layout">
Initial Letter Layout</h3>

	There are two types of <a>initial letter boxes</a>:
	those that arise from non-replaced <a>inline boxes</a>
	and those that arise from <a>atomic inlines</a>.

	For the non-atomic <dfn lt="inline initial letter | inline initial letter box">inline initial letter</dfn>,
	the box and its contents
	participate in the same <a>inline formatting context</a>
	as the line on which it occurs,
	and a lot of special rules apply
	to give the expected sizing and alignment.

	For an <dfn lt="atomic initial letter | atomic initial letter box">atomic initial letter</dfn>,
	however,
	which is either a <a>replaced element</a>
	or which establishes an <a>independent formatting context</a> for its contents,
	the sizing of the box
	(aside from its <a>automatic size</a> in the <a>block axis</a>)
	and layout of the contents within the box
	follows the usual rules:
	it is primarily the positioning of the box
	which is special.

<h4 id="initial-letter-properties">
Properties Applying to Initial Letters</h4>

	All properties that apply to an <a>inline box</a>
	also apply to an <a>inline initial letter</a>
	except for 'vertical-align' and its <a>sub-properties</a>,
	'font-size', 'line-height', 'line-sizing', and 'inline-sizing'.
	<!-- Basically, any properties defined in css-inline
	except those specific to initial letters,
	so keep this list updated as we add things to this spec. -->
	Additionally, all of the <a>sizing properties</a>
	and 'box-sizing' also apply to <a>initial letters</a>,
	(see [[!css-sizing-3]]).

	All properties that apply to an <a>atomic inline</a>
	also apply to the <a>atomic inline</a> when styled as an <a>initial letter</a>,
	except for 'vertical-align' and its <a>sub-properties</a>.

<h4 id="initial-letter-box">
Margins, Borders, and Padding</h4>

	Initial letters can be styled with margins, padding, and borders
	just like any other box.
	Unless 'initial-letters-align' is ''initial-letters-align/border-box'',
	its vertical alignment and sizing are not affected;
	however the effective exclusion area is
	(and corresponds to the margin area).

	ISSUE: Reword that to handle 'box-sizing' correctly.

	When padding and borders are zero,
	the initial letter may be kerned;
	see below.

<h3 id="sizing-initial-letters">
Font Sizing of Initial Letters</h3>

	For an <a>inline initial letter</a>,
	the font size used for sizing the <a>initial letter</a> contents
	is calculated to fulfill its specified <a>size</a> (see 'initial-letters')
	as anchored by its specified alignment points (see 'initial-letters-align').
	Note that no layout is required in this calculation:
	it is based only on computed values and font metrics.
	These <a lt="used value">used</a> font size calculations
	<em>do not</em> affect the <a lt="computed value">computed</a> 'font-size',
	and therefore have no effect on the computation of ''em'' length values, etc.

	ISSUE: What about inheritance to descendants?

	For an <a>atomic initial letter</a>,
	the used font size is the computed font size as usual.

	The line height used in these calculations
	is the 'line-height' of the containing block
	(or, in the case where a baseline grid is in use,
	the baseline-to-baseline spacing required by the baseline grid [[CSS-LINE-GRID-1]]).
	The contents of the lines spanned,
	and therefore any variation in their heights and positions,
	is not accounted for.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/infinite-text.png" width="300"
     alt="text underlay shows how initial letter alignment is not affected

	</figure>

	For an <var>N</var>-line drop initial in a Western script,
	the cap-height of the letter needs to be (<var>N</var> – 1) times the line-height,
	plus the cap-height of the surrounding text.
	Note this height is <em>not</em> the font size of the drop initial.

	Actually calculating this font size is tricky.
	For an <var>N</var>-line drop initial,
	we find the drop initial font size to be:

	<figure>
		<img src="images/InitialCapEquation.png" width="604"
		     alt="Font size of drop cap = ((N-1) * line-height + [cap-height of para] * [font size of paragraph])/[cap-height ratio of drop initial font]">

	</div>
	-->

	ISSUE: Update this calculation to be a) generic across writing systems / alignment points and b) handle non-integer sizes.

	<div class="example">
		A three-line drop initial in Adobe Minion Pro
		would have a font size of 61.2pt given
		12pt text, 16pt line-height, and a cap-height of 651/1000 (from the font’s OS/2 table).
	</div>

<h4 id="initial-letter-shaping">
Shaping and Glyph Selection</h4>

	When 'initial-letters' is not ''initial-letters/normal'',
	shaping <em>should</em> still occur across
	an <a>inline initial letter box</a>'s boundaries.
	(See [[css-text-3#boundary-shaping]].)
	For example, if the first letter of the Farsi word “پس”
	were styled with ''initial-letters: 2 1'',
	both letters would be styled in their joined forms,
	with initial-form “ﭘ” as the <a>initial letter</a>,
	followed by the normally-styled final-form “ﺲ”.
	Note that the two letters might not always graphically connect,
	even when shaped in their joining forms.

	Issue: Are there other things we need to consider here?

<h3 id="initial-letter-box-size">
Sizing the Initial Letter Box</h3>

	For an <a>inline initial letter</a>,
	if the <a>initial letter</a>’s <a>specified width</a>/<a>specified height</a>
	is <a>definite</a>,
	use that value
	(clamped as required by the <a>min size</a> and <a>max size</a> properties,
	and handling 'box-sizing' as required)
	for that dimension of the box.

	Otherwise
	it is considered to have an <a>automatic size</a> in that dimension
	and is sized and positioned to coincide with
	the smallest rectangle that would include
	the bounding boxes of all its glyphs--
	excluding any that <a spec="css-text-3">hang</a>
	(see 'hanging-punctuation')--
	as well as the margin boxes of any atomic inlines it contains.

	ISSUE: Should the hanging punctuation be included in the box instead
	(so that the box is drawn around the punctuation when it is made visible through borders/background),
	but rather only excluded when positioning the box
	(so that the initial letter remains flush,
	with the hanging punctuation properly hanging)?
	See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/310">discussion</a>.

	For <a>atomic initial letters</a>,
	sizing follows the usual rules for that type of <a>atomic inline</a>.
	However, if the box has an [=automatic size|automatic=] [=block size=] (''height/auto''),
	then its <a>block size</a> is determined
	as for an <a>inline initial letter</a>
	with ''initial-letter-align/border-box'' alignment,
	and is <a>definite</a>.

<h4 id="initial-letter-content-align">
Alignment Within an Initial Letter Box</h4>

	By default (i.e. under <a>automatic sizing</a>),
	the content box of an <a>inline initial letter</a>
	is fitted exactly to its content,
	and alignment properties like 'text-align' or 'align-content' do not apply.
	However, if the box is <em>not</em> sized automatically:

	<ul>
		<li>
			If the <a>inline size</a> is <a>definite</a>,
			'text-align' is honored
			for aligning the contents of the <a>initial letter</a>
			within its box in the <a>inline axis</a>
			(using its <a>inline-axis</a> bearings as usual,
			not the bounding box of its glyph outlines).

		<li>
			If the <a>block size</a> is <a>definite</a>,
			'align-content' is honored
			for aligning its contents in the <a>block axis</a>
			(using its <a>block-axis</a> bearings,
			synthesizing them if needed).
	</ul>

<h3 id="initial-letter-position">
Initial Letter Positioning and Spacing</h3>

<h4 id="initial-letter-exclusions">
Space Below Initial Letters</h4>

	The glyph(s) of an initial letter do not always fit within the specified sink.
	For example, if an initial letter has a descender,
	it could crash into the (n+1)th line of text.
	This is not desirable.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/Dropcap-J-3line-crash.png" width="480"
		     alt="3-line drop cap with J, with descender crashing into fourth line of text">
		<figcaption>Incorrect: three-line initial letter with descender.
		In this font, the capital “J” extends well below the baseline (shown in red).</figcaption>
	</figure>

	Therefore all line boxes impacted by the glyph bounding boxes
	of an <a>initial letter</a> are excluded,
	not just those within range of the <a>initial letter sink</a>.
	Specifically, for non-atomic initial letters,
	the content box of the element is sized to fit:

	<ul>
		<li>The specified amount of sink
		(i.e the distance from the top alignment point to the bottom alignment point).

		<li>The actual ascent and descent and side bearings of all the glyphs it contains
		that are part of its inline formatting context,
		even if they leak outside their em boxes.

		<li>The margin boxes of all the atomic inlines it contains
		that are part of its inline formatting context,
		even if they leak outside its own line-height.
	</ul>

	The initial letter is then made an exclusion area,
	the same as if it were a float.
	See 'initial-letter-wrap' for details.

<h4 id="initial-letter-block-position">
Block-axis Positioning</h4>

	In the <a>block axis</a>, the <a>initial letter</a> is positioned
	as required to satisfy its <a>under</a> alignment point ('initial-letters-align')
	at its specified [=initial letter sink|sink=] ('initial-letters'),
	i.e. it is positioned
	such that it would sink the number of lines
	specified by 'initial-letters'’s second argument
	and align to the requisite <a>under</a> alignment point
	if it was assumed that its containing block held only
	the <a>initial letter</a> itself
	followed by an infinite sequence of plain text
	as the direct contents of its <a>root inline box</a>.

	Its position is anchored with respect to the line on which it occurs.

<h4 id="initial-letter-inline-position">
Inline Positioning and Kerning</h4>

	In the <a>inline axis</a>, the position of the inline letter
	is given by matching its <a>inline-start</a> <a>margin edge</a>
	with the <a>inline-start</a> edge of the line box.

	However, if the <a>initial letter</a> is a non-atomic inline
	with an [=automatic size|automatic=] [=inline size=] and
	zero padding and borders,
	it is negatively offset
	by the distance from the start edge of its content box
	to the point in the content that would have been placed
	at the start edge of the containing block
	if it were not an <a>initial letter</a>
	(i.e. the distance between its glyph bounding box
	and its start side bearing).

<h3 id="initial-letter-line-layout">
Line Layout</h3>

	An <a>initial letter box</a> is considered in-flow in its <a>block formatting context</a>,
	and is part of the contents of the <a>line box</a> in which it originates.
	Aside from vertical alignment,
	its interaction with the rest of the contents of the line is as normal,
	except in a few specific circumstances&hellip;

<h4 id="initial-letter-inline-flow">
Inline Flow Layout: Alignment and Justification</h4>

	For a <a>raised initial</a>
	no special consideration is given for alignment and justification:
	it is treated similar to any other inline-level content.

	However, for a <a>sunken initial</a>
	its inline-start edge is anchored to the inline-start edge
	of the line box (after indentation)
	and text alignment affects the remaining content of the line
	in the remaining space,
	without moving the <a>initial letter box</a> itself.

	Note: The CSSWG was not aware of any reasonable use cases
	for mixing non-start text alignment with dropped initial letters,
	and this was the most sensible behavior proposed.
	This behavior may be reconsidered if use cases require otherwise.

	In addition, to ensure consistent alignment of all the impacted lines,
	any 'letter-spacing' or <a>justification opportunity</a>
	that would normally be introduced by
	the juxtaposition of the contents of a <a>sunken initial</a>
	and the subsequent contents of the line
	is suppressed.
	(Note that this does not affect 'word-spacing' or
	the <a>justification opportunity</a> introduced by a <a spec=css-text>word separator</a>
	because that space is provided by the <a>typographic character unit</a> alone
	and not by its juxtaposition with an adjacent character.)

<h4 id="initial-letter-indentation">
Edge Effects: Indentation and Hanging Punctuation</h4>

	'text-indent' and 'hanging-punctuation'
	apply to the first line of text as normal in the presence of initial letters.
	Lines affected by the exclusion are shortened, as in the presence of floats,
	and are affected the same way.

	is <a href="hhttps://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/310#issuecomment-396765893">under discussion</a>.

<h4 id="initial-letter-ancestors">
Ancestor Inlines</h4>

	If the <a>initial letter box</a> is contained by <a>inline box</a> ancestors,
	the boundaries of those <a>inline boxes</a> are drawn
	to exclude the <a>initial letter box</a>,
	as if it were outside their startmost <a>margin edge</a>.
	This is a purely geometric operation:
	it does not affect e.g.
	property inheritance or
	the effective 'letter-spacing' between the <a>initial letter box</a>
	and subsequent content.

<h4 id="initial-letter-multi-line">
Multi-line Initial Letters</h4

	If an initial letter is too long to fit on one line,
	it wraps (according to the usual text-wrapping rules),
	each line filled and formatted exactly as if it were the first line
	and the initial letter too long to fit any subsequent normal text.
	Any normal text after the initial letter starts on its last line,
	affected exactly as if that line were the first line.

Clearing Initial Letters</h3>

<h4 id="raised-sunken-caps">
Raised and sunken caps</h4>
<!--old text
	An initial letter does not affect the position of its containing element.
	For “raised caps” or “sunken caps,”
	the effect is created as if the text around the initial letter was pushed down,
	rather than the letter extending up into previous elements.

-->

	The margin box of an initial letter contributes to the size
	of its containing element.
	Initial letters that extend above the first line of text,
	known as “raised caps” or “sunken caps,”
	do not extend up into previous elements.
	Since the content box for an initial letter includes all glyph ink,
	this also means that accents or other ink
	above the cap height of an initial letter
	will not impinge on previous elements.

		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	Issue: Handle glyph ink above cap height of font.
	Proposal: Make it an exclusion area for line boxes and border boxes. Include margin specified on initial-letters as part of exclusion area in order to control spacing.

	Issue: Draw a box model diagram here. Does the margin of the initial letter collapse with its container?


<h4 id="short-para-initial-letter">
Short paragraphs with initial letters</h4>

	A paragraph with an initial letter can have fewer lines of text
	than the initial letter occupies.
	In this case, the initial letter’s top alignment is still honored,
	and its exclusion area continues into any subsequent blocks.
	This forces the subsequent inline-level content to wrap around the initial letter--
	exactly as if that block's text were part of its own containing block.
	(This is similar to how floats exclude content in subsequent block boxes.)

		<figcaption>
			The red text is a short paragraph with an initial letter.
			Note the subsequent paragraph wraps around the initial letter
			just as text in the paragraph with the initial letter does.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	If the subsequent block starts with an initial letter,
	establishes an [=independent formatting context=],
	or specifies 'clear' in the initial letter’s containing block’s start direction,
	then it must clear the previous block’s initial letter.

<h4 id="initial-letter-floats">
Interaction with floats</h4>

	<a>Initial letters</a> are not <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats">floats</a>:
	they are <a>in-flow</a> <a>inline-level</a> content
	that belongs to a <a>line box</a>.
	Therefore:

	<ul>
		<li>
			The 'clear' property does not care about <a>initial letters</a>:
			it neither applies to <a>initial letters</a>
			nor clears them when applied to nearby floats.
		<li>
			Like line boxes or floats,
			<a>initial letter boxes</a>
			must not overlap the <a>margin boxes</a>
			of any floats participating in the same <a>block formatting context</a>.
			An overlapping <a>initial letter box</a>
			is shifted inward or downward
			until either it fits without overlapping
			or there are no more floats present.
		<li>
			If a line box’s start edge shifts or moves down to clear a float,
			an <a>initial letter</a> originating in it moves with it;
			likewise if an <a>initial letter</a> shifts inward or moves downward
			to clear a float,
			its originating line box and subsequent line boxes
			shorten and/or move accordingly.
		<li>
			If an <a>inline-start</a> float
			originates in the first line of content
			adjacent to an <a>initial letter</a>,
			then it moves past the <a>initial letter</a>
			towards the containing block edge,
			exactly as if the <a>initial letter</a> were any other inline-level content.

			However, if such a float originates
			in subsequent lines of content adjacent to a (sunk) <a>initial letter</a>,
			then that float must clear the <a>initial letter</a>.
	</ul>

	must clear the initial letter (as inline-start floats do)
	is <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2018Jul/0019.html">still under discussion</a>.
	There is no aesthetic reason to require it;
	however it’s yet unclear how the underlying layout model
	would distinguish between the two cases.

<h4 id="intial-letter-breaking">
Interaction with Fragmentation (Pagination)</h4>

	Since a single glyph cannot be <a>fragmented</a> across
	pages (or columns or other <a>fragmentation containers</a>),
	an <a>initial letter</a> is considered <a spec="css-break-3">monolithic</a> [[css-break-3]]
	for the purpose of block-axis <a>fragmentation</a>
	(breaking across pages, columns, regions, etc.).
	Additionally,
	breaks between the in-flow lines alongside an <a>initial letter box</a>
	are avoided,
	much as breaks between line boxes affected be 'widows' and 'orphans'
	are avoided.
	However,
	if there is a <a>forced break</a>
	alongside the <a>initial letter box</a>,
	then it takes precedence;
	but has no effect on the <a>initial letter box</a> itself.

	As with other <a spec="css-break-3">monolithic</a> objects,
	if an <a>initial letter box</a> occurs
	at the top of a <a>fragmentation container</a>
	and that <a>fragmentation container</a> is too short to contain it,
	it may be either truncated or sliced.
	Adjacent content, however, must be <a>fragmented</a> according to its own rules,
	not truncated or sliced along with the <a>initial letter</a>.

	<div class="example">
		In this example, the author is using a set of images
		to display characters that don't exist.

		<pre>
			img[src^="/text/"] {
				height: 1em; /* Size to match adjacent text */
				margin-bottom: -0.2em; /* Baseline at 20% above bottom */
			}
			...
			&lt;p>This is some text with words written in an unencoded script:
			&lt;img src="/text/ch3439.png" alt="...">
				&lt;img src="/text/ch3440.png" alt="...">
				&lt;img src="/text/ch3442.png" alt="...">
		</pre>
	</div>

	Note: A future level of CSS may include a way of specifying a full baseline table for replaced elements.
	(This will probably look like a <css>baseline-table</css> property
	that accepts ''[&lt;baseline-keyword> <<percentage>>]+''.)
