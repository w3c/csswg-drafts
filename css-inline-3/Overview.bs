Abstract: The CSS formatting model provides for a flow of elements and text inside of a container to be wrapped into lines. This module describes box model for this inline layout model and defines the block-axis alignment and sizing of inline-level content, extending the model in [[CSS2]]. It also adds a special layout mode for drop-caps.
Ignored Terms: line-height-shift-adjustment, text-script, after, before, alignment subtree
Link Defaults: css-fonts-3 (property) font-family, css-color-3 (property) color
At Risk: the 'initial-letter-wrap' property

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	This module defines [=inline layout=], the CSS model
	for laying out a mixed stream of text and [=inline-level=] boxes,
	and defines controls for the [=block-axis=] alignment and sizing
	of this content within each line.
	It also adds a [[#initial-letter-styling|special layout mode for drop caps and similar initial letter styling]].

	Note: Line-breaking, justification, and other aspects of
	inline-axis positioning of [=inline-level=] content
	are handled in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text/">CSS Text Module</a>.

	ISSUE: Many aspects of layout here depend on font metrics.
	While the relevant metrics exist in OpenType for Latin/Cyrillic/Greek
	and for <abbr title="Chinese/Japanese/Korean">CJK</abbr>,
	they are missing for many other writing systems.
	For example, the visual top metric for Hebrew has no metric in the OpenType tables.
	For this module to work well for the world,
	we need fonts to provide the relevant metrics for all writing systems,
	and that means both that OpenType needs to allow such metrics
	and font designers need to provide accurate numbers.
	See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5244">issue</a> and

Module Interactions</h3>

	This module
	replaces and extends the CSS inline layout model and features defined in
	[[!CSS2]] section 10.8.

<h3 id="values">
Value Definitions</h3>

	This specification follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]]
	using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs">value definition syntax</a> from [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values &amp; Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification
	also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> as their property value.
	For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

<h2 id="model">
Inline Layout Model</h2>

	In <dfn>inline layout</dfn>,
	a mixed, recursive stream of text and [=inline-level boxes=]
	forming an <dfn>inline formatting context</dfn> within a [=block container=]
	are laid out by [=fragmenting=] them into a stack of [=line boxes=],
	and aligning the text and boxes to each other within each [=line box=].

	Any [=block container=] that directly contains
	[=inline-level=] content--
	such as [=inline boxes=], [=atomic inlines=], and [=text runs=]--
	establishes an [=inline formatting context=]
	to lay out its contents.
	The [=block container=]’s [=content edges=] form the [=containing block=]
	for each of the [=inline-level boxes=]
	participating in its [=inline formatting context=].

	The [=block container=] also generates
	a <dfn export>root inline box</dfn>,
	which is an <a lt="anonymous box">anonymous</a> [=inline box=] that holds
	all of its [=inline-level=] contents.
	(Thus, all text in an [=inline formatting context=] is directly contained
	by an [=inline box=],
	whether the [=root inline box=] or one of its descendants.)
	The [=root inline box=] inherits from its parent [=block container=],
	but is otherwise unstyleable.

	In an [=inline formatting context=],
	content is laid out along the [=inline axis=],
	ordered according to the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#text-direction">Unicode bidirectional algorithm and its controls</a> [[CSS-WRITING-MODES-3]]
	and distributed according to the typesetting controls in [[CSS-TEXT-3]].
	[=Inline-axis=] [=margins=], [=borders=], and [=padding=]
	are respected between [=inline-level boxes=]
	(and their margins do not <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins">collapse</a>).
	The resulting rectangular area that contains the boxes
	that form a single line of [=inline-level content=]
	is called a <dfn export>line box</dfn>.

	Note: <a>Line boxes</a> and <a>inline boxes</a> and <a>inline-level boxes</a>
	are each different things!
	See [[CSS-DISPLAY-3]] for an in-depth discussion of box types and related terminology.

<h3 id="line-boxes">
Layout of Line Boxes</h3>

	[=Line boxes=] are created as needed
	to hold [=inline-level=] content
	within an [=inline formatting context=].
	When an [=inline box=] exceeds the [=logical width=] of a [=line box=],
	or contains a <a spec="css-text-3">forced line break</a>,
	it is split (see [[css-text-3#line-breaking]])
	into several [=fragments=] [[css-break-3]],
	which are partitioned across multiple [=line boxes=].
	Like [=column boxes=] in [=multi-column layout=] [[CSS-MULTICOL-1]],
	[=line boxes=] are [=fragmentation containers=]
	generated by their [=formatting context=],
	and are not part of the CSS [=box tree=].

	Note: [=Inline boxes=] can also be
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#bidi-box-model">split into several fragments
	within the same line box due to bidirectional text processing</a>.
	See [[CSS-WRITING-MODES-3]].

	[=Line boxes=] are stacked
	as the direct contents of the [=block container box=]
	in its [=block flow direction=]
	and aligned within this container as specified by 'align-content' [[CSS-ALIGN-3]].
	Thus, an [=inline formatting context=] consists of
	a stack of [=line boxes=].
	[=Line boxes=] are stacked with no separation
	(except as specified elsewhere,
	e.g. for [=float=] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#clearance">clearance</a>)
	and they never overlap.

	In general,
	the [=line-left=] edge of a [=line box=] touches
	the [=line-left=] edge of its [=containing block=]
	and the [=line-right=] edge touches
	the [=line-right=] edge of its [=containing block=],
	and thus the [=logical width=] of a line box is equal to
	the <a lt="inner size">inner</a> [=logical width=]
	of its [=containing block=]
	(i.e. the [=block container=]’s [=content box=]).
	However, floating boxes or [=initial letter boxes=]
	can come between the [=containing block=] edge and the [=line box=] edge,
	reducing the space available to, and thus the [=logical width=] of,
	any such impacted [=line boxes=].
	(See [[CSS2/visuren#inline-formatting]]/[[CSS2/visuren#floats]]
	and [[#initial-letter-styling]].)

	Within the [=line box=],
	[=inline-level boxes=] can be aligned
	along the [=block axis=]
	in different ways:
	their [=line-over|over=] or [=line-under|under=] edges can be aligned,
	or the baselines of text within them can be aligned.
	See 'vertical-align' and its longhands.

	The [=logical height=] of a [=line box=] is then fitted to its contents;
	this fit is controlled by 'line-height' and 'text-edge'.
	The first/last line boxes in a [=block container=] may additionally
	be trimmed by 'leading-trim'.

	[=Line boxes=] that contain no text,
	no [=preserved white space=],
	no [=inline boxes=] with non-zero [=margins=], [=padding=], or [=borders=],
	and no other [=in-flow=] content
	(such as [=atomic inlines=] or [=ruby annotations=]),
	and do not end with a [=forced line break=]
	must be treated as zero-[=logical height|height=] [=line boxes=]
	for the purposes of determining the positions of any elements inside of them
	(such as [=absolutely positioned boxes=]),
	and must be treated as not existing for any other purpose
	(such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins">collapsing margins</a>).

	</figure>

<h3 id="line-layout">
Layout Within Line Boxes</h3>

	As described [[#model|above]],
	user agents flow [=inline-level boxes=] into a stack of [=line boxes=].
	Layout within each [=line box=] is performed,
	sizing and positioning each [=box fragment=] and [=line box=] independently,
	as follows:

	1. The [=layout bounds=] of each [=inline-level box=] in the [=line box=]
		are calculated.

		<ul class=switch>
			<li>
				For [=atomic inlines=] such as [=replaced elements=] and [=inline blocks=]:
				this is their [=margin box=].
			<li>
				For the [=root inline box=],
				and for [=inline boxes=] with ''text-edge: leading'':
				this derived from their used 'line-height',
				ignoring any [=margin=]/[=border=]/[=padding=]
				see [[#inline-height]].

			<li>
				For other [=inline boxes=]:
				this is derived from their 'text-edge' metrics,
				and includes any [=margin=]/[=border=]/[=padding=],
				see [[#inline-height]]
		</ul>

	2. The [=inline-level boxes=]
		are aligned in the [=block axis=]
		according to 'dominant-baseline' and 'vertical-align'.
		Those with [=line-relative values=] for 'baseline-shift'
		are assumed to be aligned so as to minimize the line box height.

	3. The [=line box=]’s [=logical height=] is calculated
		to exactly include the aligned [=layout bounds=]
		of all its [=inline-level boxes=].

	4. The [=root inline box=]’s [=aligned subtree=]
		and boxes with line-box&ndash;relative 'vertical-align' values
		are aligned with respect to the [=line box=].

		Issue: Define what to do for top/bottom/center aligned boxes that are taller than the rest of the content.

	Note: Empty [=inline boxes=] still have
	[=margins=], [=padding=], [=borders=], and a 'line-height',
	and thus influence these calculations just like boxes with content.

<h3 id="paint-order">
Painting Order</h3>

	Except as specified for [=positioned boxes=] (see [[!CSS-POSITION-3]])
	[=inline-level boxes=] are painted in [=document order=];
	the 'z-index' property does not generally apply.

<h2 id="css-metrics">
Baselines and Alignment Metrics</h2>

<h3 id="baseline-intro">
Introduction to Baselines</h3>

	A <dfn export>baseline</dfn> is a line along the <a>inline axis</a> of a line box
	along which individual glyphs of text are aligned.
	[=Baselines=] guide the design of glyphs in a font
	(for example, the bottom of most alphabetic glyphs
	typically align with the alphabetic baseline),
	and they guide the alignment of glyphs from different fonts or font sizes
	when typesetting.

	<figure>
		<img alt="Picture of alphabetic text in two font sizes with the baseline and em-boxes"
		     width="480"
		     src="images/alphabetic-baseline-in-two-font-sizes.svg"></p>
		<figcaption>
			Alphabetic text in two font sizes with the baseline and em-boxes
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	Different writing systems prefer different [=baselines=].

	<figure>
		<img alt="Latin prefers the alphabetic baseline,
		          on top of which most letters rest,
		          though some letters have descenders that dangle below it.
		          Indic scripts are sometimes typeset with a hanging baseline,
		          since their glyph shapes appear to be hanging from a horizontal line.
		          Han-based systems, whose glyphs are designed to fill a square,
		          tend to align on their bottoms or through their centers."
		     src="images/script-preferred-baselines.gif"></p>
		<figcaption>
			Preferred baselines in various writing systems
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	A well-constructed font contains a <dfn>baseline table</dfn>,
	which indicates the position of one or more [=baselines=]
	within the font's design coordinate space.
	(The design coordinate space is scaled with the font size.)

	<figure>
		<img alt=""
		        src="images/baselines.gif"></p>
		<figcaption>
			In a well-designed mixed-script font,
			the glyphs are positioned in the coordinate space
			to harmonize with one another when typeset together.
			The baseline table is then constructed
			to match the shape of the glyphs,
			each baseline positioned to match the glyphs
			from its preferred scripts.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	The [=baseline table=] is a property of the font,
	and the positions of the various baselines
	apply to all glyphs in the font.

	Different [=baseline tables=] can be provided for alignment
	in horizontal and vertical text.
	UAs should use the vertical tables in vertical [=typographic modes=]
	and the horizontal tables otherwise.

	Note: Fonts can have more than one [=baseline table=] in each axis;
	the UA is responsible for choosing the appropriate table
	in consideration of 'font-language-override' and the [=content language=].

<h3 id="baseline-types">
Baselines and Metrics</h3>

	CSS uses the following text-based metrics
	as [=baselines=]
	for [=inline layout=] functions
	such as alignment, box sizing, and initial letter layout.

	Issue: The CSSWG would like to know which baseline values are necessary
	for each property that uses them ('dominant-baseline', 'alignment-baseline', 'text-edge', 'initial-letter-align'):
	if any can be dropped, or any need to be added.
	See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/859">Issue 859</a>.

	</dl>

	Note: These metrics are optical design metrics,
	and therefore do not necessarily correspond exactly
	to actual glyph outlines.

	In general, these metrics are taken from the appropriate font,
	but if they are missing or need to be derived from a box rather than text,
	they must be synthesized,
	see [[#baseline-tables]] and [[#baseline-synthesis]].

<h4 id="ascent-descent">
Ascent and Descent Metrics</h4>

	CSS assumes that every font has font metrics
	that specify a characteristic height above the baseline--
	called the <dfn local-lt="ascent">ascent metric</dfn>--
	and a characteristic depth below it--
	called the <dfn local-lt="descent">descent metric</dfn>--
	which CSS uses for laying out text and boxes
	in an [=inline formatting context=].
	Note that these are metrics of the font as a whole
	and need not correspond to the ascender and descender of any individual glyph.

	Note: It is recommended that implementations that use OpenType or TrueType fonts
	use the metrics <code>sTypoAscender</code> and <code>sTypoDescender</code>
	from the font's OS/2 table
	(after scaling to the current element's font size)
	to find the [=ascent metric=] and [=descent metric=] for CSS layout.
	In the absence of these metrics,
	the "Ascent" and "Descent" metrics from the HHEA table should be used.

	<!-- Note dependency from Canvas API fontBoundingBoxAscent/Descent
	     https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#dom-textmetrics-fontboundingboxascent
	-->

<h4 id="font-line-gap">
Line Gap Metrics</h4>

	Font formats can allow for a font-recommended
	“line gap” or “external leading” metric.
	This metric is referred to as the <dfn>line gap metric</dfn>,
	and may be incorporated into the [=line box=] [=logical height=] calculations
	when 'line-height' is ''line-height/normal'' as described in [[#inline-height]].

	Note: In OpenType, the [=line gap metric=] can be found
	as <code>sTypoLineGap</code> or <code>hhea.lineGap</code>.

<h3 id="baseline-tables">
Baselines of Glyphs and Boxes</h3>

	Each font, glyph, and [=inline-level box=]
	is assumed to have a [=baseline=] coordinate
	for each [=baseline=] type
	indicating that [=baseline=]’s position on its [=block axis=].
	The set of such [=baselines=] is called its <dfn>baseline set</dfn>.
	The [=baseline=] from this set that is used to align
	the box or glyph within its [=alignment context=]
	is called its [=alignment baseline=];
	the [=baseline=] used to align its content within itself
	is called its [=dominant baseline=].

	For an individual glyph,
	the [=baseline set=] derives from the font’s [=baseline table=].
	For an [=inline box=],
	it derives from its [=first available font=]
	regardless of whether the box actually contains any glyphs from that font.
	If the requisite metrics are missing from a font,
	the UA must synthesize them,
	see [[#baseline-synthesis-fonts]].

	For other [=boxes=],
	its [=baseline set=] is nominally derived from its contents
	in accordance with 'baseline-source'
	and the rules of the [=formatting context=] in which it participates.
	For an [=atomic inline box=] with no [=baseline set=]
	in the [=inline formatting context=]’s [=inline axis=]
	its [=alignment baselines=] are [=synthesize baseline|synthesized=]
	from its [=margin box=],
	see [[#baseline-synthesis-box]].

<h2 id="alignment">
Baseline Alignment</h2>

	While most CSS [=formatting contexts=] position content
	by aligning boxes with respect to their container’s edges,
	[=inline layout=] positions boxes in the [=block axis=]
	by aligning them with respect to each other
	using their [=baselines=].

	More specifically,
	(unless using a [=line-relative shift value=])
	each glyph or [=inline-level box=]
	is aligned in the [=block axis=]
	by positioning its [=alignment baseline=]
	to match the <em>corresponding</em> [=baseline=] of its parent
	(which is its [=alignment context=]),
	and then is potentially shifted from that position
	according to its [=post-alignment shift=].

	Note: Baseline alignment always matches corresponding baselines:
	alphabetic to alphabetic, hanging to hanging, mathematical to mathematical, etc.

	When aligning a [=box=], the [=alignment baseline=] is chosen
	according to its 'alignment-baseline' and 'baseline-source' values
	(see shorthand 'vertical-align'),
	and defaults to matching the parent’s 'dominant-baseline'.
	For a glyph, the [=alignment baseline=] is always determined
	by the parent’s [=dominant baseline=].

	<div class="example">
		<p>Given following sample markup:
		<pre highlight=html>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="outer"&gt;Ap &lt;span class="inner"&gt;ਜੀ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

		<p>And the following style rule:
		<pre highlight=css>.inner { font-size: 75%; }</pre>

		<p>The [=baseline sets=] of the parent (<code>.outer</code>) and the child (<code>.inner</code>)
		will not match up due to the font size difference.
		The child box is aligned to its parent
		by matching up their [=alphabetic baselines=].

		<figure>
			<img alt="In this example, the distance between each baseline in the baseline set
			          is compacted 75% in the span with a 75% font size.
			          Their alphabetic baselines, however, line up."
			     src="images/baseline-align-sizes.gif">
		</figure>


		<p>The [=alphabetic baseline=] is used here
		because by default a box’s [=alignment baseline=] matches
		the [=dominant baseline=] of its parent,
		and in horizontal [=typographic mode=],
		the [=dominant baseline=] itself defaults to the [=alphabetic baseline=].

		<p>If we add ''vertical-align: super''
		to the <code>.inner</code> element from the example above,
		the same rules are used to align the <code>.inner</code> child to its parent;
		but in addition to the baseline alignment,
		the child is shifted to the superscript position.
		<figure>
			<p><img alt="In this example, the resulting alignment is equivalent to
			             shifting the parent baseline table upwards by its superscript offset,
			             and then aligning the child's alphabetic baseline
			             to the shifted position of the parent's alphabetic baseline."
			        src="images/baseline-align-super.gif">

	This property specifies the <dfn>dominant baseline</dfn>,

	For [=inline boxes=],
	the [=dominant baseline=] is used to align the box’s text
	(and, unless otherwise specified by 'vertical-align', any [=inline-level=] child boxes)
	by aligning each glyph/box’s corresponding baseline to the box’s own [=dominant baseline=].
	For other boxes, it indicates the default <a>alignment baseline</a>

	This property specifies the <dfn>preferred line height</dfn>:
	the [=logical height=] of the [=inline box=]
	as used in the [[#line-layout|calculation of the line box height]].

	Note: Because it inherits to the [=root inline box=]
	when specified on a [=block container=],
	'line-height' effectively establishes
	the minimum height of the block’s [=line boxes=].

	Values for this property have the following meanings:

	Note: Glyphs from fonts other than the [=first available font=]
	do not impact the [=layout bounds=] or [=baseline=] position
	of an [=inline box=] with a non-''line-height/normal'' 'line-height'.

	<div class="example">
		The three rules in the example below have the same used line height:

		However, they inherit differently:
		the first one inherits as a number,
		which will lead to different line heights if descendants have different font sizes;
		the last two as inherit as absolute lengths,

	Note: Although margins, borders, and padding of [=inline boxes=]
	do not enter into the line height calculation,
	they are still rendered around these boxes.
	This means that if the size specified by 'line-height'

	ISSUE: This is an early draft of a proposal,
	and might change significantly
	as design critiques and use cases are registered
	and various details and interactions with other properties are worked out.
	<strong>Do not implement (yet).</strong>

	[=Inline boxes=], whose primary purpose is to contain text,
	are sized in the [=block axis=] based on their font metrics.
	The 'text-edge' property controls which metrics are used.

	This property defines which metric is used
	as the basis for the [=over=] and [=under=] edges
	of the [=layout bounds=] of the [=inline box=].
	The 'leading-trim' property can be used
	to match the [=content edges=] to these same metrics.
	The first value specifies the <dfn>text over edge</dfn>;
	the second value specifies the <dfn>text under edge</dfn>.
	If only one value is specified,
	both edges are assigned that same keyword if possible;
	else ''text-edge/text'' is assumed as the missing value.

	ISSUE(5236): Do we need [=longhands=] or is this shorthand enough?

	Note: The ''text-edge/leading'' and ''text-edge/text'' values
	rely on the font [=ascent=] and [=descent=] to make sure the text fits.
	Other values are more likely to result in overlap or overflow
	caused by ascents above the specified metrics
	(such as for diacritics),
	so authors using these values need to be careful
	to provide sufficient spacing above the line.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for="text-edge" dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>leading</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the [=ascent=]/[=descent=] plus any positive [=half-leading=].

		<dt><dfn>alphabetic</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the [=alphabetic baseline=].
	</dl>

	All values apply negative [=half-leading=].

	Unless 'text-edge' is ''text-edge/leading''--
	in which case the box’s own 'line-height' is used to add spacing--
	the box’s margin, padding, and border also contribute
	to the size of the [=line box=].

<h3 id="inline-height">
Logical Height Contributions of Inline Boxes</h3>

	The contribution of an [=inline box=] to the [=logical height=] of its [=line box=],
	here referred to as its <dfn>layout bounds</dfn>,
	is always calculated with respect to its own text metrics,
	as described below,
	and is controlled by 'text-edge' and 'line-height'.
	The sizes and positions of child boxes do not influence
	its [=layout bounds=]
	(nor its own [=logical height=], for that matter,
	see 'inline-sizing').

	Note: The [=layout bounds=] need not correspond
	to the box’s edges.

	To find the [=layout bounds=] of an [=inline box=],
	the UA must first align
	all the glyphs <em>directly</em> contained in the [=inline box=]
	to each other by their [=dominant baselines=].
	(See [[#baseline-tables]].)
	If the [=inline box=] contains no glyphs at all,
	or if it contains only glyphs from fallback fonts,
	it is considered to contain a “strut” (an invisible glyph of zero width)
	with the metrics of the box's [=first available font=].

	For each glyph (including the “strut”),
	<var>A</var> represents its ascent above the [=baseline=];
	<var>D</var> represents its descent below.
	Unless 'text-edge' specifies a different metric to use,
	<var>A</var> refers to the [=ascent metric=]
	(for the given font at its given size)
	and <var>D</var> to the [=descent metric=],
	each adjusted to account for the [=dominant baseline=]’s offset from zero.
	If 'line-height' computes to ''line-height/normal''
	and either 'text-edge' is ''text-edge/leading''
	or this is the [=root inline box=],
	the font’s [=line gap metric=]
	may also be incorporated into <var>A</var> and <var>D</var>
	by adding half to each side as [=half-leading=].

	When its computed 'line-height' is ''line-height/normal'',
	the [=layout bounds=] of an inline box encloses all its glyphs,
	going from the highest <var>A</var> to the deepest <var>D</var>.
	(Note that glyphs in a single box
	can come from different fonts
	and thus might not all have the same <var>A</var> and <var>D</var>.)

	When its computed 'line-height' is not ''line-height/normal'',
	its [=layout bounds=] are derived solely from
	metrics of its [=first available font=]
	(ignoring glyphs from other fonts),
	and <dfn>leading</dfn> is used
	to adjust the effective <var>A</var> and <var>D</var>
	to add up to the used 'line-height'.
	Calculate the [=leading=] <var>L</var>
	as <var>L</var> = 'line-height' - (<var>A</var> + <var>D</var>).
	Half the [=leading=] (its <dfn>half-leading</dfn>)
	is added above <var>A</var> of the first available font,
	and the other half below <var>D</var> of the first available font,
	giving an effective ascent above the baseline of
	<var>A′</var> = <var>A</var> + <var>L</var>/2,
	and an effective descent of <var>D′</var> = <var>D</var> + <var>L</var>/2.
	However, if 'text-edge' is not ''text-edge/leading''
	and this is not the [=root inline box=],
	if the [=half-leading=] is positive, treat it as zero.
	The [=layout bounds=] exactly encloses
	this effective <var>A′</var> and <var>D′</var>.

	Note: <var>L</var> may be negative.

	Additionally,
	when 'text-edge' is not ''text-edge/leading'',
	the [=layout bounds=] are inflated
	by the sum of the [=margin=], [=border=], and [=padding=]
	on each side.

	In Quirks Mode [[!QUIRKS]],
	any [=inline box=] [=box fragment|fragment=]
	that has zero borders and padding and
	that does not directly contain text or <a>preserved white space</a> [[!CSS-TEXT-3]]
	is ignored when sizing the line box.

<h3 id="leading-trim">
Half-Leading Control: the 'leading-trim' property</h3>

	To ensure consistent spacing in the basic case of running text,
	CSS line layout introduces leading both above and below
	the text content of each line.
	In addition, the ascent and descent font metrics themselves
	include extra space above and below the most common glyph sizes
	in order to accommodate occasional characters and diacritics
	which ascend or descend beyond the typical bounds.
	This prevents subsequent lines of text from overlapping each other.
	However, all this extra spacing interferes with visual alignment
	and with control over effective (visually-apparent) spacing.

	The 'leading-trim' properties allow controlling the spacing above and below
	the first and last lines of a block.
	It allows precise control over spacing;
	moreover, by relying on font metrics rather than hard-coded lengths,
	it allows content to be resized, rewrapped, and rendered in a variety of fonts
	while maintaining that spacing.

	Note: Content and ink overflowing a box
	due to non-initial values of 'leading-trim'
	is handled the same as content that would overflow the box or line box otherwise.

	<div class="example">
		<!-- Example from Weston Thayer in https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3240#issuecomment-432375650 -->

		It's easy to vertically center the text container to an icon,

		rather than the ascent and descent,
		this often doesn't yield the intended visual effect.

		To center the text visually,

		as the top and bottom edges of the text,
		respectively.

		By using 'leading-trim' to strip out the spacing above the cap height

		centering the box actually centers the text;
		and does so reliably, regardless of what font is used to render it.

An Introduction to Initial Letters</h3>

	<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

	Large, decorative letters have been used to start new sections of text since before the invention of printing.
	In fact, their use predates lowercase letters entirely.

<h4 id="drop-initial">
Drop Initial</h4>

	A <dfn>dropped initial</dfn> (or “drop cap”)
	is a larger-than-usual letter at the start of a paragraph,
	with a baseline at least one line lower than the first baseline of the paragraph.
	The size of the drop initial is usually indicated by how many lines it occupies.
	Two- and three-line drop initials are very common.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/Dropcap-E-acute-3line.png" width="480"
		     alt="3-line drop cap with E Acute"  >
		<figcaption>
			Three-line drop initial with E acute.
			Since the cap-height of the drop initial aligns with the cap-height of the main text,
			the accent extends above the paragraph.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	The exact size and position of a <a>dropped initial</a>
	depends on the alignment of its glyph.
	Reference points on the drop cap must align precisely
	with reference points in the text.
	The alignment constraints for drop initials depend on the writing system.

	In Western scripts, the top reference points are
	the cap height of the initial letter and of the first line of text.
	The bottom reference points are
	the alphabetic baseline of the initial letter
	and the baseline of the Nth line of text.
	The figure below shows a simple two-line drop cap, with the relevant reference lines marked.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/Dropcap-lines.png" width="600"
		     alt="drop cap showing alignment">
		<figcaption>Two-line drop cap showing baselines (green lines), cap-height (red line), and ascender (cyan line).</figcaption>
	</figure>

	In Han-derived scripts, the initial letter extends
	from the <a>block-start</a> edge of the glyphs on the first line
	to the <a>block-end</a> edge of the glyphs on the Nth line.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/Initial-2line-JapaneseVertical.png" width="480"
		     alt="Japanese Vertical Initial">
		<figcaption>Two-line drop initial in vertical writing mode</figcaption>
	</figure>

	In certain Indic scripts,
	the top alignment point	is the hanging baseline,
	and the bottom alignment point is the text-after-edge.

	</figure>


<h4 id="sunk-initial">
Sunken Initial Letters</h4>

	Some styles of drop initials do not align with the first line of text.
	A <dfn>sunken initial</dfn> (or “sunken cap”)
	both sinks below the first baseline,
	and extends above the first line of text.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/SunkenCapA.png" width="480"
		     alt="sunken drop initial">
		<figcaption>Sunken cap. The letter drops two lines, but is the size of a three-line initial letter.</figcaption>
	</figure>

<h4 id="raise-initial">
Raised Initial Letters</h4>

	A <dfn>raised initial</dfn> (often called a “raised cap” or “stick-up cap”) “sinks” to the first text baseline.

	Note: A proper raised initial has several advantages over
	simply increasing the font size of a first letter.
	The line spacing in the rest of the paragraph will not be altered,
	but text will still be excluded around large descenders.
	And if the size of raised initial is defined to be an integral number of lines,
	implicit baseline grids can be maintained.

<h3 id="selecting-drop-initials">
Selecting Initial Letters</h3>

	<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

	Initial letters are typically a single letter, although
	they may include punctuation or a sequence of characters which
	are perceived by the user to be a single typographic unit.
	The ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element,
	defined in [[SELECT]] and [[CSS-PSEUDO-4]],
	can be used to select the character(s) to be formatted as <a>initial letters</a>.

	Authors who need more control over which characters are included in an initial letter,
	or who want to apply initial-letter formatting to replaced elements or multiple words
	can alternately apply the 'initial-letter' property to the first inline-level child of a block container.

	<div class="example">
	<pre>
		&lt;p>This paragraph has a dropped “T”.
		&lt;p>&lt;img alt="H" src="illuminated-h.svg">ere we have an illuminated “H”.
		&lt;p>&lt;span>Words may also&lt;/span> be given initial letter styling at the beginning of a paragraph.
	</pre>

	<pre>
		::first-letter, /* style first paragraph's T */
		img, /* style illuminated H */
		span /* style phrase inside span */
		{ initial-letter: 2; }
	</pre>
	</div>

	Note that
	since ''::first-letter'' selects punctuation before or after the first letter,
	these characters are included in the [=initial letter=] when ''::first-letter'' is used.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/initial-letter-punctuation-quote.png" width="604"
		     alt="Paragraph showing both opening quote and first letter set as three-line drop cap">
		<figcaption>The ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element selects the quotation mark as well as the “M”.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	Issue: Should there be a way to opt out of this behavior? See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/310">GitHub Issue 310</a>.

<h3 id="sizing-drop-initials">
Creating Initial Letters: the 'initial-letter' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">

	Inherited: no
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: the keyword ''initial-letter/normal'' or a number paired with an integer
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	This property specifies
	the <a lt="initial letter size">size</a> and <a lt="initial letter sink">sink</a>
	for dropped, raised, and sunken initial letters
	as the number of lines spanned.

	<div class="example">
		For example, the following code will create
		a 2-line dropped initial letter
		at the beginning of each paragraph
		that immediately follows a second-level heading:
		<pre>h2 + p::first-letter { initial-letter: 2; }</pre>
	</div>

	It takes the following values:

	<dl dfn-for=initial-letter dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>normal</dfn>
		<dd>
			No special initial letter effect. Text behaves as normal.

		<dt><dfn><<number>></dfn>

			<dfn dfn lt="initial letter sink" local-lt="sink">sink</dfn>.
			A value of ''1'' indicates a <a>raised initial</a>;
			values greater than ''1'' indicate a <a>sunken initial</a>.

		<dd>
			Computes to an <a>initial letter sink</a>

			floored to the nearest positive whole number.
	</dl>

	If the <a>initial letter sink</a> value is omitted,
	''drop'' is assumed.

	Values other than ''initial-letter/normal''
	cause the affected box to become an
	<dfn lt="initial letter | initial letter box">initial letter box</dfn>,
	which is an <a>in-flow</a> <a>inline-level box</a>

<h4 id="first-most-inline-level">
Applicability</h4>

	To give authors more control over which characters can be styled as an <a>initial letter</a>
	and to allow the possibility of multi-character <a>initial letters</a>
	(such as for first word or first phrase styling),
	the 'initial-letter' property applies not just
	to the CSS-defined ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element,
	but also to
	''list-style-position/inside''-positioned ''::marker'' pseudo-elements and
	to [=inline-level boxes=]
	that are placed at the start of the first line.
	Specifically, 'initial-letter' applies to
	any <a>inline-level box</a>--
	including any such ''::first-letter'' or ''::marker'' box--
	that is the first child of its parent box
	and whose ancestors (if any) that are descendants of its <a>containing block</a>
	are all first-child <a>inline boxes</a>
	that have a <a lt="computed value">computed</a> 'initial-letter' value
	of ''initial-letter/normal''.

	<div class="example">
		For example,
		the <code>&lt;span></code>, <code>&lt;em></code>, and <code>&lt;b></code> elements
		in the following example are
		"first-most inline-level descendants" of the <code>&lt;p></code>,
		but the <code>&lt;strong></code> element
		is not:

		<xmp>
			<p><span><em><b>This</b> phrase</em> is styled
			<strong>specially</strong>.</span> …
		</xmp>

		If we apply the following rules:

		<pre>
			em { initial-letter: 2; }
			b, strong { initial-letter: 3; }
		</pre>

		The 'initial-letter' property will take effect only on the <code>&lt;em></code>.
		The styling on <code>&lt;b></code>
		is ignored,
		as it has an ancestor already styled as an <a>initial letter</a>;
		and the styling on <code>&lt;strong></code> is ignored
		because it is a second sibling.

		The result might be rendered as

		<figure>
			<img src="images/firstmost-inline.png"
			     alt="“This phrase” becomes the dropped text spanning two lines, the remainder of the text wrapping alongside.">
		</figure>
	</div>

	If 'initial-letter' is applied to an <a>inline-level box</a>
	that is not positioned at the start of the line due to bidi reordering
	or which is otherwise preceded by other <a>inline-level</a> content,
	its <a>used value</a> is ''initial-letter/normal'',
	and it is not formatted as an <a>initial letter</a>.

	The effect of the 'initial-letter' property is undefined
	on children of <a>ruby</a> base container boxes
	and on <a>ruby</a> container boxes.

	Note: The 'initial-letter' property cannot apply to any element
	whose 'float' is not ''float/none'' or 'position' is not ''static'',
	because these values cause its 'display' to compute to ''display/block''.

Alignment of Initial Letters: the 'initial-letter-align' property</h3>

	As mentioned earlier, the alignment of initial letters
	depends on the script used.
	The 'initial-letter-align' property can be used to specify the proper alignment.

	Two sets of alignment points are necessary:
	the <a>over</a> and <a>under</a> alignment points of the <a>initial letter</a>
	are matched to corresponding <a>over</a> and <a>under</a> points
	of the [=root inline box=].

	Values have the following meanings:

	the box and its contents
	participate in the same <a>inline formatting context</a>
	as the line on which it occurs,

	the sizing of the box
	(aside from its <a>automatic size</a> in the <a>block axis</a>)
	and layout of the contents within the box
	follows the usual rules:
	it is primarily the positioning of the box
	which is special.

Properties Applying to Initial Letters</h4>

	All properties that apply to an <a>inline box</a>
	also apply to an <a>inline initial letter</a>
	except for 'vertical-align' and its <a>sub-properties</a>,
	'font-size', 'line-height', 'text-edge', and 'inline-sizing'.
	<!-- Basically, any properties defined in css-inline
	except those specific to initial letters,
	so keep this list updated as we add things to this spec. -->
	Additionally, all of the <a>sizing properties</a>
	and 'box-sizing' also apply to <a>initial letters</a>
	(see [[!css-sizing-3]]).

	All properties that apply to an <a>atomic inline</a>
	also apply to the <a>atomic inline</a> when styled as an <a>initial letter</a>,
	except for 'vertical-align' and its <a>sub-properties</a>.

<h4 id="initial-letter-box">
Margins, Borders, and Padding</h4>

	Initial letters can be styled with [=margins=], [=padding=], and [=borders=]
	just like any other box.
	Unless 'initial-letter-align' is ''initial-letter-align/border-box'',
	its vertical alignment and [[#sizing-initial-letter|font sizing]]
	are not affected.
	However the effective exclusion area,
	which is typically the [=initial letter=]’s [=margin box=]
	(see 'initial-letter-wrap')
	is affected.

	When padding and borders are zero,
	the initial letter may be kerned;
	see below.

<h4 id="sizing-initial-letter">
Font Sizing of Initial Letters</h4>

	For an <a>inline initial letter</a>,
	the font size used for sizing the <a>initial letter</a> contents
	is calculated to fulfill its specified <a lt="initial letter size">size</a> (see 'initial-letter')
	as anchored by its specified alignment points (see 'initial-letter-align').
	Note that no layout is required in this calculation:
	it is based only on computed values and font metrics.
	These <a lt="used value">used</a> font size calculations
	<em>do not</em> affect the <a lt="computed value">computed</a> 'font-size',
	and therefore have no effect on the computation of ''em'' length values, etc.

	ISSUE(4988): What about inheritance to descendants?

	The line height used in these calculations
	is the 'line-height' of the containing block
	(or, in the case where a baseline grid is in use,
	the baseline-to-baseline spacing required by the baseline grid [[CSS-LINE-GRID-1]]).
	The contents of the lines spanned,
	and therefore any variation in their heights and positions,
	is not accounted for.

	For an <var>N</var>-line drop initial in a Western script,

	Note this height is <em>not</em> the font size of the drop initial.

	Actually calculating this font size is tricky.
	For an <var>N</var>-line drop initial,
	we find the drop initial font size to be:

	ISSUE: Update this calculation to be a) generic across writing systems / alignment points and b) handle non-integer sizes.

	<div class="example">
		A three-line drop initial in Adobe Minion Pro

<h4 id="initial-letter-shaping">
Shaping and Glyph Selection</h4>

	When 'initial-letter' is not ''initial-letter/normal'',
	an [=inline initial letter=] is isolated for glyph shaping;
	however the text after it <em>should</em> shape across
	the <a>inline initial letter box</a>'s boundaries,
	assuming its presence as part of the first line’s text content.
	(See [[css-text-3#boundary-shaping]].)
	For example, if the first letter of the word “يحق”
	were styled with ''initial-letter: 2 1'',
	the first letter would be styled in its isolated form “ي”,
	as the <a>initial letter</a>,
	followed by the medial/final-form “ﺤﻖ”,
	which assumes it is preceded by the initial letter’s contents
	as normal text.

<h4 id="initial-letter-box-size">
Sizing the Initial Letter Box</h4>

	For an <a>inline initial letter</a>,
	if the <a>initial letter</a>’s <a>preferred width</a>/<a>preferred height</a>
	is <a>definite</a>,
	use that value
	(clamped as required by the <a>min size</a> and <a>max size</a> properties,
	and handling 'box-sizing' as required)
	for that dimension of the box.

	Otherwise
	it is considered to have an <a>automatic size</a> in that dimension
	and its [=content box=] is sized to fit both:
	<ul>
		<li>
			The specified [=sink=]
			(i.e the space between the over alignment point and the under alignment point).
		<li>
			The glyph outlines of all the glyphs it contains--
			excluding any that <a spec="css-text-3">hang</a>
			(see 'hanging-punctuation')--
			as well as the [=margin boxes=] of any [=atomic inlines=] it contains.

			<div class="example" id="initial-letter-exclusions">
				The glyph(s) of an initial letter do not always fit within the specified sink.
				For example, if an initial letter has a descender,
				it could crash into the (n+1)th line of text.
				This is not desirable.

				of an <a>initial letter</a> need to be excluded,
				not just those within range of the <a>initial letter sink</a>.

				</figure>
			</div>
	</ul>

	However, if its [=block-start=] [=padding=] and [=border=] are both zero,
	then its [=block-start=] [=content edge=] instead coincides
	with its [=over=] alignment point exactly,
	and any content overflowing above that point is ignored for the purpose of layout.

	Note: If an [=inline initial letter=] has ascenders above its [=over=] alignment point,
	and the author has not provided sufficient [=margin=]
	on either the [=initial letter=] itself or its [=containing block=],
	then those ascenders might collide with preceding content.

	Note: It might be nice to automatically provide the necessary spacing
	by treating such ascenders as a margin that can collapse
	with the margin of the containing block,
	and thus guarantee the requisite spacing without imposing any additional space
	unless it becomes actually necessary.
	Depending on implementation complexity,
	this option may be explored in the future;
	but in the meantime,
	authors need to be careful to provide the requisite spacing explicitly.

	ISSUE: Should the hanging punctuation be included in the box instead
	(so that the box is drawn around the punctuation when it is made visible through borders/background),
	but rather only excluded when positioning the box
	(so that the initial letter remains flush,
	with the hanging punctuation properly hanging)?
	See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/310">discussion</a>.

	For <a>atomic initial letters</a>,
	sizing follows the usual rules for that type of <a>atomic inline</a>.
	However, if the box has an [=automatic size|automatic=] [=block size=] (''height/auto''),
	then its <a>block size</a> is determined
	as for an <a>inline initial letter</a>
	with ''initial-letter-align/border-box'' alignment,
	and is <a>definite</a>.

<h4 id="initial-letter-content-align">
Alignment Within an Initial Letter Box</h4>

	By default (i.e. under <a>automatic sizing</a>),
	the content box of an <a>inline initial letter</a>
	is fitted exactly to its content,
	and alignment properties like 'text-align' or 'align-content' do not apply.
	However, if the box is <em>not</em> sized automatically:

	<ul>
		<li>
			If the <a>inline size</a> is <a>definite</a>,
			'text-align' is honored
			for aligning the contents of the <a>initial letter</a>
			within its box in the <a>inline axis</a>
			(using its <a>inline-axis</a> bearings as usual,
			not the bounding box of its glyph outlines).

		<li>
			If the <a>block size</a> is <a>definite</a>,
			'align-content' is honored
			for aligning its contents in the <a>block axis</a>
			(using its <a>block-axis</a> bearings,
			synthesizing them if needed).
	</ul>

<h3 id="initial-letter-position">
Initial Letter Positioning and Spacing</h3>

<h4 id="initial-letter-block-position">
Block-axis Positioning</h4>

	In the <a>block axis</a>, the <a>initial letter</a> is positioned
	with respect to the [=line box=] in which it [=originates=]
	as required to satisfy its alignment ('initial-letter-align')
	and specified [=initial letter sink|sink=] ('initial-letter'):

	* If its [=initial letter size|size=] is greater than or equal to
		its [=initial letter sink|sink=],
		the [=initial letter=] is positioned
		to satisfy its <a>under</a> alignment,
		and then shifted by
		([=initial letter sink|sink=] - 1) &times; 'line-height' of [=containing block=]
		towards the [=containing block=]’s [=block end=].

	* If its [=initial letter size|size=] is less than
		its [=initial letter sink|sink=],
		the [=initial letter=] is positioned
		to satisfy its <a>over</a> alignment.

	Note: An [=initial letter=] is essentially positioned
	such that it would sink the number of lines
	specified by 'initial-letter'’s second argument
	and align to the requisite <a>under</a> alignment point
	if it was assumed that its containing block held only
	the <a>initial letter</a> itself
	followed by an infinite sequence of plain text
	as the direct contents of its <a>root inline box</a>.
	Its position is not affected by line height inconsistencies
	introduced by the contents of the impacted line boxes.

	<figure>

		     alt="Constant-sized text underlay shows how initial letter alignment
		          is not affected by the content of the spanned lines.">
	</figure>

	The [=initial letter=] does not increase the [=logical height=]
	of the [=line box=] in which it participates:
	it can protrude above or below it.
	It must be positioned such that its own [=block-start=] [=margin edge=]
	is below its [=containing block=]’s [=block-start=] [=content edge=],
	and thus can force its [=originating line box=] (and subsequent content)
	to shift further away from that edge.

<h4 id="initial-letter-inline-position">
Inline Kerning</h4>

	If the <a>initial letter</a> is a non-atomic inline
	with an [=automatic size|automatic=] [=inline size=] and
	zero padding and borders,
	its [=margin box=] is kerned (negatively inset)
	by the distance from the start edge of its content box
	to the point in the content that would have been placed
	at the start edge of the [=line box=]
	if it were not an <a>initial letter</a>
	(i.e. the distance between its glyph bounding box
	and its start side bearing).
	This inset is effectively
	an additional [=inline-start=] [=margin=] on the box.

<h3 id="initial-letter-wrapping">

	In this case, the initial letter’s top alignment is still honored,
	and its exclusion area continues into any subsequent blocks.
	This forces the subsequent inline-level content to wrap around the initial letter--
	exactly as if that block's text were part of its own containing block.
	(This is similar to how floats exclude content in subsequent block boxes.)

		<figcaption>
			The red text is a short paragraph with an initial letter.
			Note the subsequent paragraph wraps around the initial letter
			just as text in the paragraph with the initial letter does.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	If the subsequent block starts with an initial letter,
	establishes an [=independent formatting context=],
	or specifies 'clear' in the initial letter’s containing block’s start direction,
	then it must clear the previous block’s initial letter.

Interaction with floats</h4>

	<a>Initial letters</a> are not <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats">floats</a>:
	they are <a>in-flow</a> <a>inline-level</a> content
	that belongs to a <a>line box</a>.
	Therefore:

	<ul>
		<li>
			The 'clear' property does not care about <a>initial letters</a>:
			it neither applies to <a>initial letters</a>
			nor clears them when applied to nearby floats.
		<li>
			Like line boxes or floats,
			<a>initial letter boxes</a>
			must not overlap the <a>margin boxes</a>
			of any floats participating in the same <a>block formatting context</a>.
			An overlapping <a>initial letter box</a>
			is shifted inward or downward
			until either it fits without overlapping
			or there are no more floats present.
		<li>
			If a line box’s start edge shifts or moves down to clear a float,
			an <a>initial letter</a> [=originating=] in it moves with it;
			likewise if an <a>initial letter</a> shifts inward or moves downward
			to clear a float,
			its [=originating line box=] and subsequent line boxes
			shorten and/or move accordingly.
		<li>
			If an <a>inline-start</a> float
			originates in the first line of content
			adjacent to an <a>initial letter</a>,
			then it moves past the <a>initial letter</a>
			towards the containing block edge,
			exactly as if the <a>initial letter</a> were any other inline-level content.

			However, if such a float originates
			in subsequent lines of content adjacent to a (sunk) <a>initial letter</a>,
			then that float must clear the <a>initial letter</a>.
	</ul>

		<figure>
		<img src="images/float-interaction.png" width="480"
		     alt="initial letter interacting with floats">
		<figcaption>
			In the absence of an initial letter, the first line of text could abut the blue float.
			But the presence of the initial letter requires that the text move over.
		</figcaption>

	See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats">CSS2&sect;9.5</a>
	for more information about the layout of floats
	and adjacent content.
	[[!CSS2]]

	ISSUE: Whether an inline-end float originating in subsequent lines
	must clear the initial letter (as inline-start floats do)
	is <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2018Jul/0019.html">still under discussion</a>.
	There is no aesthetic reason to require it;
	however it’s yet unclear how the underlying layout model
	would distinguish between the two cases.

<h4 id="initial-letter-breaking">
Interaction with Fragmentation (Pagination)</h4>

	Since a single glyph cannot be <a>fragmented</a> across
	pages (or columns or other <a>fragmentation containers</a>),
	an <a>initial letter</a> is considered <a spec="css-break-3">monolithic</a> [[css-break-3]]
	for the purpose of block-axis <a>fragmentation</a>
	(breaking across pages, columns, regions, etc.).
	Additionally,
	breaks between the in-flow lines alongside an <a>initial letter box</a>
	are avoided,
	much as breaks between line boxes affected be 'widows' and 'orphans'
	are avoided.
	However,
	if there is a <a>forced break</a>
	alongside the <a>initial letter box</a>,
	then it takes precedence;
	but has no effect on the <a>initial letter box</a> itself.

	As with other <a spec="css-break-3">monolithic</a> objects,
	if an <a>initial letter box</a> occurs
	at the top of a <a>fragmentation container</a>
	and that <a>fragmentation container</a> is too short to contain it,
	it may be either truncated or sliced.
	Adjacent content, however, must be <a>fragmented</a> according to its own rules,
	not truncated or sliced along with the <a>initial letter</a>.

Appendix A: Synthesizing Alignment Metrics</h2>

<h3 class="no-num" id="baseline-synthesis-em">
A.1: Calculating [=Em-over=] and [=Em-under=]</h3>

	Note: The [=em-over=] and [=em-under=] baselines are not used by CSS.
	Their definitions are included in this module
	for consistency with the other metrics used by
	<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#textmetrics">Canvas TextMetrics API</a>.

	The [=em-over=] and [=em-under=] metrics are calculated as follows:

	* If any one of
		[=central=], [=ideographic-over=], or [=ideographic-under=]
		is defined by the font,
		then [=em-over=] is 0.5em over the [=central=] baseline,
		and [=em-under=] is 0.5em under it,
		with the [=central=] baseline derived from the others
		if missing or undefined
		(see below).

	* Otherwise, the [=ascent=] and [=descent=]
		are both proportionally augmented or reduced
		to add up to exactly 1em,
		and these normalized metrics are taken
		as the [=em-over=] and [=em-under=] metrics, respectively.

	Note: This calculation ensures that [=em-over=] and [=em-under=]
	are always exactly 1em apart
	while trying to center the glyph outlines’ “center of gravity” between them.

<h3 class="no-num" id="baseline-synthesis-fonts">
A.2: Synthesizing Baselines (and Other Font Metrics) for Text</h3>

	Some fonts might not contain the metrics information necessary
	to align text properly as described in this module.
	User agents may use the following strategies
	in the absence of a required metric:

	<dl>
		<dt>Use related metrics
		<dd>
			Certain metrics are typically related,
			and this relationship can be used
			to at least heuristically derive the missing metric.
			If the font format itself does not define any specific calculations,
			the following rules may be used:

			<ol>
				<li>
					The [=central baseline=] is defined to be
					halfway between the [=ideographic-over=] and [=ideographic-under=] baselines,
					so any two of these determines the third.
				<li>
					The [=ideographic-over=] and [=ideographic-under=] baselines
					are typically ''1em'' apart,
					so if only one of the
					[=ideographic-over=]/[=ideographic-under=]/[=central=]
					baselines are provided,
					this relation can be used to calculate the other two.
				<li>
					In CJK fonts the [=ascent=] and [=descent=] typically match
					the [=ideographic-over=] and [=ideographic-under=] baselines,
					so can be used as a fallback when both are missing.
			</ol>

		<dt>Measure the font
		<dd>
			Metrics may be derived from the glyph shapes.
			For example,
			<ol>
				<li>
					The center of the minus sign (U+2212)
					can be taken as the mathematical baseline.

				<li>
					The amount by which the lowercase “o”
					descends below the alphabetic baseline
					can be subtracted from its highest point
					to <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#ex">measure the x-height</a>.

					<figure>
						<img src="images/measuring-x-height-o.png" width="240"
						alt="measuring the x height of the letter o"  >
						<figcaption>
							Measuring the x height.
						</figcaption>
					</figure>

				<li>
					The amount by which the uppercase “O”
					descends below the alphabetic baseline
					can be subtracted from its highest point
					to measure the cap-height.

				<li>
					The bounding box of 永 (U+6C38) can be used to find
					the ideographic character face edges.

				<li>
					The top edge of the center of the Hebrew He (U+05D4 “ה”)
					can be taken as the Hebrew hanging baseline.

				<li>
					The top edge of the center of the letter Ka
					can be taken as the hanging baseline.
					Which Ka is used should depend on the <a>content language</a>:

					<table class="data">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Language
								<th>Script
								<th>Letter
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>
								<td>Devanagari
								<td>क U+0915 KA
							<tr>
								<td>
								<td>Bengali
								<td>ক U+0995
							<tr>
								<td>
								<td>Gurmukhi
								<td>ਕ U+0A15
							<tr>
								<td>
								<td>Tibetan
								<td>ཀ U+0F40
					</table>

					Issue: Pick a default.

						alt="finding the position of the hanging baseline of the letter ka"  >
						<figcaption>
							The hanging baseline is at the top edge of the character ink.
						</figcaption>
					</figure>

				<li>Issue: Add more notes here?
			</ol>

			Issue: Somebody sanity-check these heuristics please.

		<dt>Use fallback values
		<dd>
			The following fallback values are suggested:

			<ul>
				<li>x-height: .5em;
				<li>cap-height: .66em;
				<li>hanging baseline: .6em;

<h3 class="no-num" id="baseline-synthesis-box">
A.3: Synthesizing Baselines for Atomic Inlines</h3>

	If an [=atomic inline=]
	(such as an inline-block, inline-table, or [=replaced element=])
	does not have a content-derived [=baseline set=]
	in the [=inline axis=] of the [=inline formatting context=] in which it participates,
	then the UA must synthesize its [=baselines=] as follows
	in order to align it.

	These [=baselines=] are assumed to be
	<strong>at its [=line-under=] [=margin edge=]</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li>[=text-under baseline=]
		<li>[=ideographic-under baseline=]
		<li>[=ideographic-ink-under baseline=]
		<li>[=alphabetic baseline=]
	</ul>

	These [=baselines=] are assumed to be <strong>halfway between
	its [=line-under=] and [=line-over=] [=margin edges=]</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li>[=central baseline=]
		<li>[=math baseline=]
		<li>[=x-middle baseline=]
	</ul>

	These [=baselines=] are assumed to be
	<strong>at its [=line-over=] [=margin edge=]</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li>[=text-over baseline=]
		<li>[=ideographic-over baseline=]
		<li>[=ideographic-ink-over baseline=]
		<li>[=cap-height baseline=]
		<li>[=hanging baseline=]
		<li>[=x-height baseline=]
	</ul>

	Note: Authors can use margins (positive or negative)
	to adjust the alignment of replaced content within a line.

	<div class="example">
		In this example, the author is using a set of images
		to display characters that don't exist.

		<pre>
			img[src^="/text/"] {
				height: 1em; /* Size to match adjacent text */
				margin-bottom: -0.2em; /* Baseline at 20% above bottom */
			}
			...
			&lt;p>This is some text with words written in an unencoded script:
			&lt;img src="/text/ch3439.png" alt="...">
				&lt;img src="/text/ch3440.png" alt="...">
				&lt;img src="/text/ch3442.png" alt="...">
		</pre>
	</div>

	Note: A future level of CSS may include a way of specifying a full [=baseline table=] for replaced elements.
	(This will probably look like a <css>baseline-table</css> property
	that accepts ''[&lt;baseline-keyword> <<percentage>>]+''.)
