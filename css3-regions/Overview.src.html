    <strong>CHANGES IN PROGRESS, NOT READY FOR REVIEW</strong>

    <p>The CSS regions module allows content to flow across multiple areas
    called regions. The regions do not necessarily follow the document order.
    The CSS regions module provides an advanced content flow mechanism, which
    can be combined with positioning schemes as defined by other CSS modules
    such as the Multi-Column Module [[CSS3COL]] or the Grid Layout Module
    [[CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]] to position the regions where content flows.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

    <p>Capturing the complex layouts of a typical magazine, newspaper, or
    textbook requires capabilities beyond those available in existing CSS
    modules. This is the purpose of the CSS regions module.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The CSS regions module can be seen as an extension of the concept of
    multi-column elements. With CSS Multi-column layout [[CSS3COL]], columns
    share the same dimensions and define column boxes organized in rows.
    Content flows from one column to the next.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The multi-column model is an example of flowing content from one area to
    another, where the areas are the multi-column element's column boxes and
    the flow is made of the multi-column element's children.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>However, for more complex layouts, content needs to flow from one area
    of the page to the next without limitation of the areas' sizes and
    positions. These arbitrary areas are the target of specific content flows.
    In this document these areas are called regions, and the content flows are
    called named flows. Regions are based on the rectangular geometry of the
    CSS box model. Elements in a named flow are taken out of the normal visual
    formatting and rendered in a chain of regions.</p>

    <h3 id="named-flows-and-regions">Named flows and regions</h3>

    <p>Consider the layout illustrated in figure 1.</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/regions-intro.svg" width="400" alt=
        "multiple chained regions which should receive content from a flow">

        <p class="caption">Layout requiring sophisticated content flow</p>
    </div>

    <p>The designer's intent is to position an image in region 'A' and to flow
    an article's text from region '1', to region '2', '3' and '4'.</p>

    <p>The following code snippet shows the content to flow between the regions
    1, 2, 3 and 4.</p>
    <pre>
&lt;div <em>id="article"</em>&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is an example ...&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;h1&gt;More Details&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This illustrates ...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then, the example ...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, this ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
        
</pre>

    <p>CSS layout facilities can position and size regions as needed. However,
    there is no existing mechanism to associate the content with the regions so
    that content flows as intended. Figure 2 shows an example of the intended
    visual rendering of the content.</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/regions-intro-rendering.png" width="450" alt=
        "Sample rendering showing a single thread of text flowing through a chain of regions">

        <p class="caption">Sample rendering for desired layout</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since the CSS regions module is independent of the layout of regions and
    the mechanism used to create them, the following assumes there is a CSS
    selector for the regions and, for the purpose of the example, the selectors
    for regions 1, 2, 3 and 4 show as ''&lt;region1_sel&gt;'',
    ''&lt;region2_sel&gt;'', ''&lt;region3_sel&gt;'' and
    ''&lt;region4_sel&gt;'' respectively.</p>

    <div class="example">
        <pre>
&lt;style&gt;

#article {
    <strong>flow-into: article_flow;</strong>
}

&lt;region1_sel&gt;, &lt;region2_sel&gt;, 
&lt;region3_sel&gt;, &lt;region4_sel&gt; {
    <strong>content: flow-from(article_flow);</strong>
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>
    </div>
    
    <p>The 'article_flow' value on the 'flow-into' property directs the ''#article''
        element to the 'article_flow' named flow. Setting the regions' content property
        to 'flow-from(article_flow)' associates these regions with the named flow: the flow is
        ''poured'' into the desired regions.</p>

    <h3 id="region-styling">Regions styling</h3>

    <p>Region styling allows content to be styled depending on the region it
    flows into. It is a form of context-based styling, similar to <a href=
    "#CSSMEDIAQUERIES">Media Queries</a> [[MEDIAQ]] which enable or disable
    selectors depending on the rendering context. With region styling,
    additional selectors may apply depending on the region into which content
    flows.</p>

    <p>In our example, the designer wants to make text flowing into region 1
    larger, bold and dark blue. In addition, <code class=
    "html">&lt;h1&gt;</code> headers should be run-ins and crimson.</p>

    <p>This design can be expressed with region styling as shown below.</p>

    <div class="example">
        <pre>
&lt;style&gt;
/*
 * Default article styling.
 */
#article {
    color:#777;
    text-align: justify;
}

#article h1 {
    border-left: 1px solid #777;
    padding-left: 2ex;
}

/*
 * Additional styling to apply to content when it falls into 
 * region1
 */
<strong>@region &lt;region1_sel&gt; {</strong>
    #article::region-lines {
        font-weight: bold;
        color: #0C3D5F;
        font-size: larger;
    }

    #article h1 {
        color: crimson;
        display: run-in;
        border: none;
        padding: 0px;
    }
<strong>}</strong>
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>The '@region' rule for region 1 limits its selectors to content flowing
    into region 1. The following figure shows how the rendering changes if we
    do not increase the font size nor make it bold for content flowing into
    region 1. As more content can be fitted, more content is subject to the
    contextual selectors, resulting in more dark blue text into region 1.</p>

    <p>The ''::region-lines'' pseudo-element is described later in this
    specification.</p>

        <p>There was a recent discussion on intrinsic sizing of regions which 
        <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0629.html">has not been resolved</a></p>.
    </div>
    
    <h3 id="named-flow">Named flow</h3>
    
    <p>A <def name="named-flow">named flow</def> is the ordered sequence of elements 
    associated with a flow with a given identifier. Elements in a named flow are ordered
    according to the document order.</p>
    
    <p>Elements are placed into a named flow with the 'flow-into' property.
    The elements in a named flow are laid out in the chain of regions that
    are associated with this named flow. The 'region-order' property defines how <span title=
    "region">regions</span> are organized in to a <span title=
    "region-chain">region chain</span>.</p> 
    
    <p>Content from a named flow is broken up between regions according to the 
        regions flow breaking rules.</p>

<!--
    <p>In the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html">CSS formatting
    model</a>, elements and pseudo-elements can be in the <em>normal flow</em> or out of the
    <em>(normal) flow</em>. Boxes generated by elements in the normal flow are
    subject to their container box's normal layout scheme. Boxes generated by
    elements out of the normal flow are subject to a different layout scheme.
    For example, absolutely positioned elements are subject to absolute
    positioning into their <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#containing-block-details">containing
    block</a>. This can be described by saying that the absolutely positioned
    elements are part of a special flow (called <span title=
    "positioned-flow">positioned flow</span>) which is subject to a special
    layout by its container box (i.e., its container box positions it into the
    containing block's box).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>In both cases, there is a notion of flow containing a sequence of
    elements and there is a notion of <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css2-src/visuren.html#block-boxes">(block)
    container box</a> into which the elements flow.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The CSS regions module generalizes the concept of flow by adding the
    concept of a <em>named flow</em>. This module lets authors explicitly place
    elements into a <em>named flow</em>.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>With this model, all elements are moved to a flow as part of the visual
    formatting. That flow may be the normal flow, a named flow or a positioned
    flow, for example. A flow gets formatted visually when associated with one
    or several elements' container box(es). When an flow is associated with
    container boxes, the boxes generated by the flow's elements are laid out
    according to the container box's layout scheme and the flow is subject to
    the <a href='#flow-breaking-rules'>'flow breaking rules'</a> described
    below.</p>

    <p>A container's layout scheme is the strategy used by a container to
    position the boxes generated by its children and itself. Examples are the
    normal layout (block and inline formatting) ([[CSS21]]), table layout
    ([[CSS21]]), the multi-column layout ([[CSS3COL]]) or the grid layout
    ([[CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]]).</p>
-->

    <h3 id="regions-flow-breaking-rules">Regions flow breaking rules</h3>

    <p>Breaking a named flow across multiple regions is similar to breaking a
    document's content across multiple pages (see [[CSS3PAGE]]) or a multi-column element's content
    across column boxes (see [[CSS3COL]]). One difference is that
    page boxes are generated based on the available content whereas regions are
    a predefined set of recipient boxes for the named flow content.</p>

    <p><span title=
    "region">Regions</span> are organized in to a <span title=
    "region-chain">region chain</span> (see the 'region-order' property).</p>

    <p>Each region in turn consumes content from its associated <span title=
    "named-flow">named flow</span>. The named flow content is
    positioned in the <dfn title="current-region">current region</dfn> until a
    natural or forced region break occurs, at which point the <span title=
    "current-region">current region</span> becomes the next one in the
    <span title="region-chain">region chain</span>. If there is no more
    <span>region</span> in the region chain and there is still content in the
    flow, the positioning of the remaining content is controlled by the
    'region-overflow' property on the last <span>region</span> in the
    chain.</p>

<!--
    <h3 id="the-visual-formatting-model-and-flows">The Visual Formatting Model
    and Flows</h3>

    <p>This section describes the flows to which elements formatted according
    to the CSS <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html">Visual
    Formatting Model</a> and other layout modules (such as Multi-Column Layout
    [[CSS3COL]]) belong to.</p>

    <p>In particular, this section describes the 'generated flow' where
    generated content of pseudo-elements is placed and several <dfn id=
    "auto-flow" title="auto flows">'auto flows'</dfn> where children of content
    elements are automatically placed.</p>

    <h4 id="normal-flow">Normal flow</h4>

    <p>In the CSS formatting model, elements are by default placed in the
    <dfn id="normal-flow-def">normal flow</dfn> of their container. Also by
    default, a container element gets its content from its <em>normal
    flow</em>. This means that by default, a container element will visually
    format its children elements and will be the only container associated with
    its normal flow.</p>

    <p>Note that floats and relatively positioned elements, in this model, are
    part of the same flow of content and flow into the same container but are
    positioned in different ways.</p>

    <p>The <em>normal flow</em> is one of the <em>auto flows</em>.</p>

    <h4 id="positioned-flow">Positioned flow</h4>

    <p>An absolutely positioned element is placed into the <dfn title=
    "positioned-flow">positioned flow</dfn> of its container. The container
    positions this element into its <em>containing block</em>.</p>

    <p>If a container has children in the <em>normal flow</em> and in the
    <em>positioned flow</em>, it applies different positioning schemes to each
    flow.</p>

    <p>The <em>positioned flow</em> is one of the <em>auto flows</em>.</p>

    <h4 id="column-flow">Column flow</h4>

    <p>Children of the multi-column element are placed in the element's
    <dfn id="column-flow-def">column flow</dfn>. The column boxes are then
    implicitly associated with the element's 'column flow'. In this model,
    multiple regions (column boxes) get their content from a single flow (the
    element's 'column flow', which is the content of the element).</p>

    <p>The <em>column flow</em> is one of the <em>auto flows</em>.</p>

    <div class="issue">
        Need to add a <dfn id="grid-cell-flow">grid cell flow</dfn> section.
    </div>

    <div class="issue">
        Need to add examples for the different flow types.
    </div>

    <h4 id="generated-flow">Generated flow</h4>

    <p>In the CSS formatting model, when the ''::before'' or ''::after''
    pseudo-elements have their content property set to one of
    ''&lt;string&gt;'', ''&lt;uri&gt;'', ''&lt;counter&gt;'',
    ''attr(&lt;identifier&gt;)'', ''open-quote'', ''close-quote'',
    ''no-open-quote'' or ''no-close-quote'', they create a <dfn id=
    "generated-flow-def">generated flow</dfn> which they format visually.</p>
-->
    <h3 id="relation-to-document-events">Relation to document events</h3>
    
    <p>The CSS regions module does not alter the normal processing of
    events in the document tree. In particular, if an event occurs on an
    element that is part of a named flow, the <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#dom-event-architecture">event's
    bubble and capture phases</a> happen following the document tree order.</p>

    <h2 id="properties-and-rules">Properties and rules</h2>

<!-- Commented out following section because it was redundant with the introduction -->

<!--
    <p>The main CSS regions module properties are the ‘flow-into’ and 'content'
    properties. The ‘flow-into’ property may place an element into a specific named
    flow. The ‘content’ property binds a region with a particular named flow. When multiple
    regions are bound to the same flow, the 'region-order' property determines
    the order in which content flows into the sequence of regions. This
    sequences of regions is called a <dfn>region chain</dfn>.</p>

    <p>The “break-*” properties control how content is broken into segments which are
        then fitted in regions.</p>
        
    <p>Styling that is unique to the region can be specified by ‘@region’ rules.</p>
-->

    <h3 id="the-flow-into-property">The 'flow-into' property</h3>

    <p>The ‘flow-into’ property can place an element into a named flow. Elements that 
        belong to the same flow are laid out in the regions associated with that flow.</p>

        <dd>The element is placed into the flow with the name '&lt;ident&gt;'. The
        element is said to have a <dfn id="specified-flow">specified
        flow</dfn>. The values 'none', 'inherit', 'default' and 'initial' are invalid flow
        names.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>A named flow needs to be associated with one or more regions for its
    elements to be visually formatted. If no region is associated with a given
    named flow, the elements in the named flow are not rendered: they do not
    generate boxes and are not displayed.</p>

    <p>The children of an element with a specified flow may themselves have a
    specified flow.</p>

    <p>If an element has a the same specified flow value as one of its
    ancestors, it becomes a
    sibling of it's ancestor for the purpose of layout in the regions laying out content
    content from that flow.</p>

    <p>The 'flow-into' property does not affect the CSS cascade and inheritance for
    the elements on which it is specified. The 'flow-into' property affects the visual
    formatting of elements placed into a named flow and of regions laying out
    content from a named flow.</p>

    <p>The edges of the first region in a region chain associated with a named flow establish 
        the rectangle that is the initial containing block of the named flow.</p>

    <p>Elements in a named flow are sequenced in document order.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p><em>This note is informative.</em></p>
        <p>The 'flow-into' property moves an 
        element into the flow and the interplay with selectors should be considered carefully.</p>
        <p>For example, </p>
        <pre>table {flow-into: table-content}</pre> 
        <p>will
        move all tables in the 'table-content' named flow. However, the</p>
        <pre>table * {flow-into: table-content}</pre>
        <p>selector will move all
        the descendants of table elements in the 'table-content' named flow. This will make all
        the descendants of table elements siblings in the named flow. Having the descendants become siblings
        in the named flow results 
        in a different processing (see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/tables.html#anonymous-boxes">CSS 2.1's anonymous table objects</a>). This note illustrates how authors must exercise caution when choosing a particular
        selector for setting the 'flow-into' property to avoid unintended results.</p> 
    </div>

    

    <p>
        If the ‘flow-into’ property is specified on an
        <code class=
        "html">&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, an <code class=
        "html">&lt;object&gt;</code> or a <code class=
        "html">&lt;embed&gt;</code> element, the 
        ‘display’ property is computed to ‘none’ and the referenced document within the element is used as the named flow. 
        In the case of the <code class="html">&lt;object&gt;</code> element if fallback occurs and the fallback element has a referenced document then that 
        document is used as the named flow, otherwise the fallback element itself is added to the named flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any properties set on the <code class=
        "html">&lt;iframe&gt;</code>/<code class=
        "html">&lt;object&gt;</code>/<code class=
        "html">&lt;embed&gt;</code> elements (including margin, border, padding, background) have no effect. 
        This redirection of content does not change representation of the elements in the document tree, just as for any other 
        source of named flow; in this case the <code class="html">&lt;iframe&gt;</code> still provides security checks for script in content (and sandbox if required).
        Events and CSS cascading work the same way as in a documents hosted in regular <code class="html">&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s.
    </p>
    <p>
        Region styling applies to content coming from <code class=
        "html">&lt;iframe&gt;</code>/<code class=
        "html">&lt;object&gt;</code>/<code class=
        "html">&lt;embed&gt;</code> sources the same way it applies to other flow content.
    </p>
    
    <br />

    <p>The 'flow-into' does not apply to the <code class="css">::first-line</code> and <code class="css">::first-character</code>.</p> 
    
    <p>The effect of 'flow-into' on generated content such as <code class="css">::marker</code>, 
        <code class="css">::before</code> and <code class="css">::after</code>
        is undefined. This may change depending on implementation feedback.</p>

            requirements.</p>
            
        <p>Should we consider adding the ability to do the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Support repeatable content. For example, have a repeatable
            heading at the start of each region where content flows.</li>

            <li>Support flow breaking marks. It might be very useful to support
            a <em>mark</em> (such as "<code class="html">...</code>") at the
            region breaking points to indicate that content has been broken out
            and is continuing on a different region.</li><!--
            <li>Support "atomic pull-outs". For example, we could have a named
            flow made of a set of atomic quotes that should be placed, one by
            one, in discrete regions. In that use case, we would need a
            property to specify that content should be taken atomically from
            the flow. May be something like the following.
                <pre class="code">
&lt;div id="quote_1" class="quote"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
...
&lt;div id="quote_n" class="quote"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="pull-out-1" class="pull-out"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="pull-out-n" class="pull-out"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
.quote {
    flow-into: "quotes";
}

.pull-out {
    content: flow-from(quotes);
    content-consume: atomic;
}

        <p>''content: flow-from(&lt;ident&gt;)'' moves an element to a named

        moved to a flow. For example:</p>

            #quote_A { flow-into: "quotes"; content: contents; }

        <p>would keep ''#quote_A'' in the normal flow but also copy its content

        <p>With regions, an element may be split across multiple regions and these 
        regions may overlap (for example if they are absolutely positioned). 
        So fragments of the same element can overlap each other. 
        Since each element has a single z-index, it would be required to 
        find another mechanism to decide in which order the 
        fragments are rendered. Since each region creates a new stacking 
        context, it is clear that each region is rendered separately and their
        rendering order follows the regular CSS rendering model.

    <p>These properties describe page, column and region break behavior
    before/after/inside the generated box. These values are normatively defined
    in [[!CSS3COL]]:</p>

        <dt>avoid-column</dt>

        <dd>Avoid a column break before (after, inside) the generated box.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>This specification adds the following new values:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>region</dt>

        <dd>Always force a region break before (after) the generated box.</dd>

        <dt>avoid-region</dt>

        <dd>Avoid a region break before (after, inside) the generated box.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>When a break splits a box, the box's margins, borders, and padding have
    no visual effect where the split occurs. However, the margin immediately
    after a forced page/column/region break will be preserved. A forced
    page/column/region break is a break that does not occur naturally.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> When the 'avoid' value is used, regions may
    overflow. In that case the 'overflow' property specified on the region
    element should be used to determine how to render the overflow.</p>

<!--

    <p>The following sections define where region breaks may happen when
    positioning a named flow across <span title="region">regions</span> in a
    <span title="region-chain">region chain</span>.</p>    

    <h4 id="allowed-region-breaks">Allowed region breaks</h4>

    <div class="issue">
        <p>The sections on "Allowed region breaks", "Forced region breaks" and
        ""Best" region breaks" are adapted from the [[!CSS21]] specification.
        There is an updated version of these paragraphs in [[CSS3PAGE]] as
        well.</p>

        <p>In addition, the CSS Multi-column Layout Module [[CSS3COL]] defines
        unified breaking properties (which this specification extends).</p>

        <p>It seems that we should:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Define a common set of rules for breaking content that accounts
            for pages, columns and regions.</li>

            <li>Define the properties for breaking content in a single
            specification as well.</li>

            <li>Specify how column, page and region breaks interact.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>


    <p>In a named flow, region breaks can occur at the following places:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>In the vertical margin between block-level boxes. When an unforced
        region break occurs here, the <a href="cascade.html#used-value">used
        values</a> of the relevant <a href="box.html#propdef-margin-top" class=
        "noxref"><span class="propinst-margin-top">'margin-top'</span></a> and
        <a href="box.html#propdef-margin-bottom" class="noxref"><span class=
        "propinst-margin-bottom">'margin-bottom'</span></a> properties are set
        to '0'. When a forced region break occurs here, the used value of the
        relevant <a href="box.html#propdef-margin-bottom" class=
        "noxref"><span class=
        "propinst-margin-bottom">'margin-bottom'</span></a> property is set to
        '0'; the relevant <a href="box.html#propdef-margin-top" class=
        "noxref"><span class="propinst-margin-top">'margin-top'</span></a> used
        value may either be set to '0' or retained.</li>

        <li>Between <a href="visuren.html#line-box">line boxes</a> inside a
        <a href="visuren.html#block-boxes">block container</a> box.</li>

        <li>Between the content edge of a block container box and the outer
        edges of its child content (margin edges of block-level children or
        line box edges for inline-level children) if there is a (non-zero) gap
        between them.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These breaks are subject to the following rules:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rule A:</strong> Breaking at (1) is allowed only if the
        'break-after' 'break-before' properties of all the elements generating
        boxes that meet at this margin allow it, which is when at least one of
        them has the value 'always', 'left', or 'right', or when all of them
        are 'auto'.</li>

        <li><strong>Rule B:</strong> However, if all of them are 'auto' and a
        common ancestor of all the elements has a 'break-inside' value of
        'avoid-region', then breaking here is not allowed.</li>

        <li><strong>Rule C:</strong> Breaking at (2) is allowed only if the
        number of <a href="visuren.html#line-box">line boxes</a> between the
        break and the start of the enclosing block box is the value of
        'orphans' or more, and the number of line boxes between the break and
        the end of the box is the value of 'widows' or more.</li>

        <li><strong>Rule D:</strong> In addition, breaking at (2) or (3) is
        allowed only if the 'break-inside' property of the element and all its
        ancestors is 'auto'.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the above does not provide enough break points to keep content from
    overflowing the region boxes, then rules A, B and D are dropped in order to
    find additional breakpoints.</p>

    <p>If that still does not lead to sufficient break points, rule C is
    dropped as well, to find still more break points.</p>

    <h4 id="forced-region-breaks">Forced region breaks</h4>

    <p>A region break <em>must</em> occur at (1) if, among the 'break-after'
    and 'break-before' properties of all the elements generating boxes that
    meet at this margin, there is at least one with the value 'always', 'left',
    or 'right'.</p>

    <h4 id="best-region-breaks">"Best" region breaks</h4>

    <p>CSS&nbsp;2.1 does <em>not</em> define which of a set of allowed region
    breaks must be used; CSS&nbsp;2.1 does not forbid a user agent from
    breaking at every possible break point, or not to break at all. But
    CSS&nbsp;2.1 does recommend that user agents observe the following
    heuristics (while recognizing that they are sometimes contradictory):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Break as few times as possible.</li>

        <li>Avoid breaking inside a replaced element.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
        <p style="display:none">Example(s):</p>

        <p>Suppose, for example, that the style sheet contains 'orphans: 4',
        'widows: 2', and there are 20 lines (<a href=
        "visuren.html#line-box">line boxes</a>) available at the bottom of the
        current region:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If a paragraph at the end of the current region contains 20
            lines or fewer, it should be placed on the current region.</li>

            <li>If the paragraph contains 21 or 22 lines, the second part of
            the paragraph must not violate the <a href=
            "page.html#propdef-widows" class="noxref"><span class=
            "propinst-widows">'widows'</span></a> constraint, and so the second
            part must contain exactly two lines</li>

            <li>If the paragraph contains 23 lines or more, the first part
            should contain 20 lines and the second part the remaining
            lines.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now suppose that <a href="page.html#propdef-orphans" class=
        "noxref"><span class="propinst-orphans">'orphans'</span></a> is '10',
        <a href="page.html#propdef-widows" class="noxref"><span class=
        "propinst-widows">'widows'</span></a> is '20', and there are 8 lines
        available at the bottom of the current region:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If a paragraph at the end of the current region contains 8
            lines or fewer, it should be placed on the current region.</li>

            <li>If the paragraph contains 9 lines or more, it cannot be split
            (that would violate the orphan constraint), so it should move as a
            block to the next region.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The 'overflow' property is honored on a region: if region content overflows,

    <h3 id="the-at-region-style-rule">The @region rule</h3>

    <p>An '@region' rule contains style declarations specific to particular
    regions.</p>

    <p>The '@region' rule consists of the keyword '@region' followed by a
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selector-syntax">selector</a>
    and a declarations block. The '@region' rule and the selector constitute
    the region's 'flow segment' selector. The region's flow segment selector
    specifies which range of elements in the flow are subject to the following
    declaration blocks: it applies to the range (see
    [[DOM-LEVEL-2-TRAVERSAL-RANGE]]) from the region's flow that flow in the
    selected region(s).</p>

    <p>Only elements that are fully in the 'flow segment' may match any of the
    selectors found in the style rule. If an element is split across regions,
    it will not be subject to region styling in any of the regions it is part
    of. However, it's children element or pseudo-elements may be.</p>

    <p>In addition, the ''::region-lines'' pseudo-element can be used to select
    the inline content of an element that falls into a particular region.</p>

        <p>The first rule set ''p::region-lines {...}'' uses the
        ''::regions-line'' pseudo-element. Since all the content is fitted in
        either 'region_1' or 'region_2', this rule set applies to all content
        lines.</p>

        <p>The second rule set ''div {...}'' applies to all <code class=
        "html">&lt;div&gt;</code> elements that fit fully into 'region_1' or
        'region_2'. In our example, there is no <code class=
        "html">&lt;div&gt;</code> in the flow that fits fully in a region,
        because <code class="html">div_1</code> is split between 'region_1' and
        'region_2'.</p>

        <p>The third rule set ''p {...}'' applies to all <code class=
        "html">&lt;p&gt;</code> elements that fit fully into 'region_1' or
        'region_2'. In our example, only <code class="html">p_1</code> fully
        fits in a region, 'region_1'.</p>

        <p>The region style ''RSB'' applies to flow content that fits in
        'region_1'.</p>

        <p>The first rule set ''p {...}'' matches <code class="html">p_1</code>
        because that paragraph fully fits in 'region_1'.</p>

        <p>The second rule set ''#p_2::region-lines {...}'' matches lines in
        <code class="html">p_2</code> that flow into 'region_1'. These lines
        will be subject to the additional style.</p>

    <div>
        <p>The properties applying to the '::region-lines' pseudo-element is
        limited to the same set as those available on the <a href=

        Is the proposed restriction that elements are only selected selector in
        a rule set appearing in an @region rule sufficient?
    </div>

    <div class="issue moved">
        <a href="http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/css3-regions?&#issue-14region-lines-pseudo-selector">Moved to specification Wiki</a>.
        There is <a href=
        "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011May/0518.html">concern</a>
        that the ''first-line'' precedent is underspecified and that more
        specification is needed in addition to referencing the existing
        precedent.
    </div>

    <p>The specificity of the selectors in a '@region' rule is calculated as
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#specificity">defined</a> in
    the CSS Selectors module (see [[SELECT]]). In other words, the '@region'
    rule adds an extra condition to the selector's matching, but does not
    change the selector's specificity. This is the same behavior as selectors
    appearing in '@media' rules declaration blocks (see [[MEDIAQ]]), where the
    rule does not influence the selectors' specificity.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Consequently, selectors that match a given element (as describe above),
    participate in the <a href="CSS2.1%20section%206.4.1">CSS Cascading
    order</a> as defined in [[!CSS21]].</p>

    <h2 id="pseudo_elements">Pseudo-elements</h2>
    
    <p>It can be useful to visually mark the content to highlight 
        that content is flowing from region to region. For example, a marker such
        as <em>'continues on page 3'</em> clearly indicates, at the end of a 
        region, that there is more content in the flow which can be found
        on 'page 3' (in this example, the notion of page is application specific).</p>
        
    <p>The '::region-before' and 
        '::region-after' pseudo-elements let content authors mark the beginning and 
        end of a region with such markers.</p>
        
    <p>The '::region-before' and '::region-after' pseudo-element are distinct from the 
    '::before' and '::after' pseudo elements (see [[!SELECT]]) in the way they are
    processed, as explained in the next section.</p>
    
    <h3 id="region-markers-processing-model">Region markers processing model</h3>
        
    <p>The '::region-before' and '::region-after' pseudo-elements are laid out prior
    to laying out other content in the region. They are used as exclusions
    (see [[CSS3EXCLUSIONS]]) when laying out the content.</p>
    
    
    <h3 id="the-region-before-and-region-after-pseudo-elements">The ::region-before and ::region-after pseudo-elements</h3>
    
    <p>The '::region-before' and '::region-after' pseudo-elements have the same definition
        as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#gen-content">'::before' and '::after'</a> pseudo-elements from the CSS3 Selectors specification ([[!SELECT]]). However, their processing model is 
        different, as explained in the previous section.</p>
 
    <h2 id="cssom_view_and_css_regions">CSSOM view and CSS regions</h2>

    <p>Since content may flow into multiple regions, authors need a way to
    determine if there are enough regions to flow all the content from a named
    flow. This is especially important considering that the size of regions may
    change depending on the display context. For example, flowing the same
    content on a mobile phone with a small screen may require more regions than
    on a large desktop display.</p>

    <p>Another example where creating more regions might be needed: if
    the user may change the font size of text flowing through regions, new
    regions may be needed to accommodate for the additional space required to
    fit the larger text or some regions may need to be removed for smaller text.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>Since an element may be split into multiple regions, invoking

    <h2 id="integration-with-other-specifications">Integration with other
    specifications</h2>

    <p>This specification does not specify how regions are created or laid out.
    This section illustrates how regions can be crated and laid out with other
    specifications. It first defines the requirements for integrating CSS
    Regions. Then it provides examples for different existing solutions.</p>

    <h3 id="region-requirements">Region requirements</h3>

    <p>For a container element (or pseudo-element) to become a region, it must
    be selectable with a CSS selector and accept the content property as
    defined in this specification.</p>

    <h3 id="integration-examples">Integration examples</h3>

    <p>Authors can use different methods to layout regions in CSS. Some
    solutions can be expressed with CSS only and not require document changes,
    some solutions leverage the document tree. The following examples
    illustrate these different options.</p>

    <h4 id="css-grid-layout">CSS Grid Layout</h4>

    <p>The CSS Grid Layout specification (see [[CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]]) does not define a
        pseudo-element for grid cells. Consequently, grid cells cannot directly be a region.</p>
    <p>However, it is possible to simply add a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#block-boxes">block container box</a> to a grid
        cell to make it a region.</p>

    <p>The following example shows how CSS Grid Layout could be use to create
    regions and position them to create the example given in the
    introduction.</p>

    <div class="issue resolved">
        <p><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Aug/0069.html">Issue resolved during the July 2011 Seattle Face to Face Meeting</a>.</p>
         
        There is a pending issue in the CSS Grid Layout module draft (section
        7.2) about whether or not grid cells should generate a box and have an
        associated 'display' property. To completely allow the use-case
        presented below, ''::grid-cell'' pseudo elements should allow box
        sizing properties and behave as block level elements.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
        <pre>
&lt;style&gt;
#grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template: "aae"
                   "bbe"
                   "cde";
}

#a { grid-cell: 'a'}
#b { grid-cell: 'b'}
#c { grid-cell: 'c'}
#d { grid-cell: 'd'}
#e { grid-cell: 'e'}

#a::before {
    content: url('illustration.png');
}

#b, #c, #d, #e {
    content: flow-from(article_flow);
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id="article"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id="grid"&gt;
            &lt;div id="a"/&gt;
            &lt;div id="b"/&gt;
            &lt;div id="c"/&gt;
            &lt;div id="d"/&gt;
            &lt;div id="e"/&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
    </div>

    <h4 id="css-multi-column-layout">CSS Multi-Column Layout</h4>

    <p>The CSS Multi-Column Layout (see [[CSS3COL]]) does not specify a
    selector for column boxes. Therefore, column boxes cannot be regions.</p>
-->
<!--
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The CSS Multi-Column specification could offer a pseudo-element selector
    (e.g., called ''nth-column'') for its column boxes. This would enable
    different content to flow through different columns. The following example
    illustrates how two different content flows could be threaded on alternate
    columns.</p>

    <div class="example">
        <pre>
&lt;style&gt;
body:before {
    columns: 4;
}

body:before::nth-column(even) {
    content: flow-from(article_1_flow);
}

body:before::nth-column(odd) {
    content: flow-from(article_2_flow);
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="article_1"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id="article_2"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>Note that if a column box becomes associated with a flow by its content
    property, it is no longer associated to the 'column flow', as discussed
    <a href="column-flow">before</a>. For example, if the second column in a
    multi column element was associated with the 'illustration' named flow, the
    regular 'column-flow' would thread through the first and third column while
    column two would flow content from the 'illustration' named flow.</p>
-->
<!--
    <h4 id="css-visual-formatting">CSS Visual Formatting</h4>

    <p>CSS (see [[CSS21]]) offers a way to visually format content with
    different layout schemes: inline and block formatting, float, absolute
    positioning, relative positioning or table layout.</p>

    <p>Elements laid out using these schemes can be regions, as illustrated
    below, using absolutely positioned elements for simplicity.</p>

    <div class="example">
        <pre>
&lt;style&gt;
#article {
    flow-into: article_flow;
}

#region_1, #region_2, #region_3, #region_4 {
    content: flow-from(article_flow);
}

#region_1 {
    /* positioning properties */
}

/* ... positioning of other regions ... */

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id="article"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id="region_A"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id="region_1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id="region_2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0413.html">resolution</a> to
            have both NamedFlow and the Element interface extension</li>
        <li>Following a working group <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0413.html">resolution</a>:
        	<ul>
            	<li>Turned the first issue in the "Extensions to the Element interface" into a note 
            explaining that the NamedFlow interface can be used when regions are pseudo-elements.</li>
            	<li>Added NamedFlowUpdate</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Excluded 'none', 'inherit' and 'initial' from the possible identifier names on 
        	the flow property following <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0583.html">discussion</a> on the mailing list.</li>
        <li>Simplified integration discussion on multi-column layout and just state that since
        column boxes are not addressable by selectors, they cannot be regions.</li>
        <li>Added specification of how the 'flow-into' property interacts with object, embed and iframe 
        elements.</li>
        <li>Excluded 'default' from the possible identifier names on the flow property because it 
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-css3-values-20060919/#keywords">may get reserved</a>.</li>
        <li>Added to the definition of 'auto' on 'region-overflow' specifying that region breaks must
            be ignored.</li>
        <li>Renamed 'Document.flowWithName' to 'Document.getFlowByName' since it is not a property.</li>
        <li>Added a note that a 'NamedFlow' instance is live.</li>
        <li>Added an 'undefined' string value to the regionOverflow property on the Element interface 
            extension.</li>
        <li>Renamed NamedFlowEvent to regionLayoutUpdate to avoid having 'Event' in the event name.</li>
		<li>Added description for special behavior of iframe/object/embed as 
		flow source</li>
		<li>Removed issue on copying content to a named flow instead of moving elements to named
		    flow following working group <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Aug/0069.html">resolution</a>.</li>
    	<li>Removed issue on content:flow-from v.s., flow-from property following working group <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Aug/0069.html">resolution</a>.</li>

    	<li>Updated the css3-grid-align example following working group <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Aug/0069.html">resolution</a> that 
    	    it should use &lt;div&gt; instead of grid-cell pseudo elements that were removed
    	    from the CSS Grid Layout specification.</li>
        <li>Renamed 'from-flow' to 'flow-from' following a working group <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Aug/0069.html">resolution</a>.</li>
        <li>Limited the applicability of 'content: flow-from()' to block container box and added
            a note that this might be expanded in the future, following a working group <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Aug/0069.html">resolution</a>.</li>
        <li>Removed issue about API to find which region displays an element in a named flow
            since <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/actions/350">ACTION-350</a> was
            created to add this API.</li>
        <li>In the 'flow' property description, removed the required wrapper anonymous 
            block as agreed on <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Aug/0161.html">mailing list discussion</a>.</li>
        <li>Reworded the paragraph on how regions create a new stacking context, as 
            per the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Aug/0025.html">mailing list discussion</a>.</li>
        <li>Reworked the "CSS regions Model" section to now be "CSS regions Layout". Moved the
            definition of a region as the first sub-section.</li>
        <li>Removed the "Visual Formatting Model and Flows" section to match the new Regions Model 
            (now CSS regions Layout) section.</li>
        <li>Moved the sections on allowed region breaks, forced region breaks and "best" regions
            breaks to follow the property definitions to follow the formatting of the paged
            media section in CSS 2.1.</li>
        <li>Added note about why regions create a new stacking context following the discussion
            on the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jul/0158.html">mailing list</a>.</li>
        <li>Removed sentence about content:none making elements disconnected following the 
                discussion on the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jul/0158.html">mailing list</a>.</li>
        <li>Removed sentence about content:none making elements disconnected following the 
                    discussion on the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jul/0158.html">mailing list</a>.</li>
        <li>Added the ::region-before and a ::region-after pseudo-elements.</li>
        <li>Added note of caution when using selectors and the 'flow-into' property following
            a <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jul/0191.html">mailing list discussion</a>.</li>
        <li>Removed sections about allowed, forced and best region breaks to align with the 
            multi-column specification approach and until the group agrees on where and how the
            general issue of breaks (regions/pages/columns) should be addressed.</li>
        <li>Removed the section on Integration with other specifications since specifications that
            was superfluous especially since there is no specific integration with multi column,
            grid or template layout.</li>
        <li>Added a note that regions establish a new block formatting context.</li>
        <li>Renamed content-order to region-order.</li>
        <li>Added a note about overflowing content in regions (e.g., for content with borders).</li>
        <li>Added a note that a region cannot layout content it is part of (to avoid creating a 
            circular dependency) in the flow-from description, specifying that if flow-from
            references the flow an element is part of, then the element does not format 
            anything visually.</li>
