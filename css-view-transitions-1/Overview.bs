# Introduction # {#intro}

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

View Transitions is a set of API that allow DOM changes to smoothly
animate between states. This is accomplished by leveraging user-agents ability
to persist visual representations of state (i.e. snapshots) and blend them with
current DOM state's visual output. The API also allows the animations to be
customized via standard CSS animation properties.

This spec describes the CSS and JS mechanics of the single-page transition API.

# Transitions as an enhancement # {#transitions-as-enhancements}

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

A key part of this API design is the view that an animated transition is an
enhancement to a DOM change. Specifically, there are two components of the API:
the DOM change, and the visual state animation. 

In order for the user-agent to generate a set of snapshots prior to the DOM
change, the API is designed to take the DOM change callback as part of the
request to initiate a transition. This means that the user-agent has an
opportunity to generate snapshots for the existing visual representation, run
the given callback to update the state, and finally generate structures and set
up animations required for the transition to occur. All this is accomplished
with a single call to the JavaScript API.

The user-agent provides additional JavaScript functionality and promises to
control and observe the state of the animations. These are described in detail
in the {{ViewTransition}} section.

After the callback has finished running, the user-agent creates a structure of
pseudo-elements that represent both the "before" and "after" states of the
transition. The structure of the pseudo-elements is dictated by the
''page-transition-tag'' property. Specifically, each element that is "tagged"
with a ''page-transition-tag'' creates a separate snapshot and thus a separate
group of pseudo-elements that are animated independently from the rest. Note
that for convenience, the root element is tagged with name "root" in the
user-agent style sheet.

The groups induced by the ''page-transition-tag'' are all positioned within a
common pseudo-element root, which itself is attached to the root element of the
page.

Each of the groups is comprised of up to four pseudo elements:
* Container pseudo-element: this element initially mirrors the size and
    position of the "before" state element that it represents (i.e. the tagged
    element that caused this group to be created). The element is animated to
    the "after" state and position.
* Wrapper pseudo-element: this element is a child of the container element and
    provides ''isolation: isolate'' for its children. It's needed so that its
    children can be blended with non-normal blend modes without affecting other
    visual outputs.
* Outgoing image: this element is a child of the wrapper element. It is a
    replaced element that produced the visual representation of the "before"
    state taken from user-agent provided snapshots. Note that the contents of
    this element can be manipulated with ''object-*'' properties in the same way
    that other replaced elements can be.
* Incoming image: this element is a child of the wrapper element. It is a
    replaced element that produces the visual representation of the "after"
    state, taken from the page's visual output of the represented elements. Like
    outgoing image, the contents can be manipulated with ''object-*'' properties.
    Note that because this element's snapshots are taken from the pages output,
    the visual output changes if the visual output of the represented element
    changes. This is similar to how an '<a
    href="https://w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts/css-images-4/#element-notation">element()</a>'
    function would work.

ISSUE: This sections can benefit from diagrams.

Each of the pseudo-elements generated can be targeted by CSS in order to
customize its appearance, behavior and/or add animations. This enables full customization of the
transition.

Note that because these APIs are an enhancement to the DOM change, some principles emerge:
* If a transition cannot run, or is skipped, the DOM change should still
    happen. If the DOM change should also be skipped, then that should be handled
    by another feature. The <a
    href="https://wicg.github.io/navigation-api/#navigate-event-class">`signal`
    on `NavigateEvent`</a> is an example of a feature developers could use to
    handle this.
* Although the transition API allows DOM changes to be asynchronous via the
    {{ViewTransitionInit/updateDOM}} callback, the transition API is not
    responsible for queuing or otherwise scheduling the DOM changes, beyond the
    scheduling needed for the transition itself. Some asynchronous DOM changes
    can happen concurrently (e.g if they're happening within independent
    components), whereas others need to queue, or abort an earlier change. This
    is best left to a feature or framework that has a more holistic view of the
    update.

# CSS properties # {#css-properties}

## 'page-transition-tag' ## {#page-transition-tag-prop}

<pre class=propdef>
Name: page-transition-tag
Value: none | <<custom-ident>>
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Percentages: n/a
Computed Value: as specified
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

The 'page-transition-tag' property "tags" an element
as participating in a page transition.

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=page-transition-tag>
    : <dfn>none</dfn>
    :: The element will not participate in a page transition.

    : <dfn><<custom-ident>></dfn>
    :: The element can participate in a page transition,
        as either an outgoing or incoming element,
        with a <dfn dfn for>page transition tag</dfn>
        equal to the <<custom-ident>>'s value.

        The value <css>none</css>
        is invalid as a <<custom-ident>>.
</dl>

The root element participates in a page transition by default using
the following style in the [=user-agent origin=].

<pre><code highlight=css>
    html {
      page-transition-tag: root;
    }
 </code></pre>

<div class=note>This property causes the user-agent to both capture separate
snapshots from the elements, as well as create separate pseudo-element
sub-trees representing this element's "before" and "after" states. Note that
for the purposes of this API, if one element has a tag "foo" in the before
state, and another element has a tag "foo" in the after state, they are treated
as representing different visual state of the same element. This may be
confusing, since the elements themselves are not necessarily referring to the
same object, but it is a useful model to consider them to be visual states of
the same conceptual page entity, that we happen to call element.
</div>

# Pseudo-elements # {#pseudo}

While the UA is [=animating a page transition=],
it creates the following <dfn export>page-transition pseudo-elements</dfn>,
to represent the various items being animated.

The ''::page-transition'' pseudo-element acts as a grouping element for other
[=page-transition pseudo-elements=] and has the document's root element as its
[=originating element=].

<p class="note">For example, '':root::page-transition'' selector matches this
pseudo-element, but ''div::page-transition'' does not.
</p>

Other [=page-transition pseudo-elements=] take a <<pt-tag-selector>> argument
to specify which elements tagged with ''page-transition-tag'' are affected.

There can be multiple pseudo-elements of the same type,
one for each ''page-transition-tag'' participating in a transition.

The <<pt-tag-selector>> is defined as follows:

<pre class=prod>
    <dfn>&lt;pt-tag-selector></dfn> = '*' | <<custom-ident>>
</pre>

A value of ''*'' makes the corresponding selector apply to all pseudo elements
of the specified type. The specificity of a page-transition selector with a
''*'' argument is zero.

The <<custom-ident>> value makes the corresponding selector apply to exactly
one pseudo element of the specified type, namely the pseudo-element that is
created as a result of the ''page-transition-tag'' property on an element with
the same <<custom-ident>> value. The specificity of a page-transition selector
with a <<custom-ident>> argument is the same as for other pseudo-elements, and
is equivalent to a [=type selector=].

The following describes all of the [=page-transition pseudo-elements=] and
their function:

: <dfn>::page-transition</dfn>
:: This pseudo-element is the grouping container of all the other
    [=page-transition pseudo-elements=].  Its [=originating element=] is the
    document's root element.

    The following [=user-agent origin=] styles apply to this element:

    <pre><code highlight=css>
    html::page-transition {
      position: fixed;
      inset: 0;
    }
    </code></pre>

    Note: This pseudo-element provides a containing block for all
    ::page-transition-container pseudo-elements. The aim of the style is to
    size the pseudo-element to cover the [=large viewport size=] and position
    all ::page-transition-container pseudo-elements relative to the origin of
    the large viewport.

: <dfn>::page-transition-container( <<pt-tag-selector>> )</dfn>
::  One of these pseudo-elements exists
    for each ''page-transition-tag'' in a page transition,
    and holds the rest of the pseudo-elements corresponding
    to this ''page-transition-tag''.

    Its [=originating element=] is the ''::page-transition''
    pseudo-element.

    The following [=user-agent origin=] styles apply to this element:

    <pre><code highlight=css>
    html::page-transition-container(*) {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;

      animation-duration: 0.25s;
      animation-fill-mode: both;
    }
    </code></pre>

    Note: The aim of the style is to position the element relative to its
    ::page-transition parent.

    In addition to above, styles in the [=user-agent origin=] animate this
    pseudo-element's 'width' and 'height' from the size of the outgoing element's
    [=border box=] to that of the incoming element's [=border box=]. Also the
    element's 'transform' is animated from the outgoing element's screen space
    transform to the incoming element's screen space transform. This style is
    generated dynamically since the values of animated properties are determined
    at the time that the transition begins.

    Issue: The selector for this and subsequently defined pseudo-elements is
    likely to change to indicate position in the pseudo-tree hierarchy.

: <dfn>::page-transition-image-wrapper( <<pt-tag-selector>> )</dfn>
::  One of these pseudo-elements exists
    for each page-transition-tag being in a page transition,
    and holds the images of the outgoing and incoming elements.

    Its [=originating element=] is the ''::page-transition-container()''
    pseudo-element with the same tag.

    The following [=user-agent origin=] styles apply to this element:

    <pre><code highlight=css>
    html::page-transition-image-wrapper(*) {
      position: absolute;
      inset: 0;

      animation-duration: inherit;
      animation-fill-mode: inherit;
    }
    </code></pre>

    In addition to above, styles in the [=user-agent origin=] add ''isolation:
    isolate'' to this pseudo-element if it has both
    ''::page-transition-incoming-image'' and ''::page-transition-outgoing-image'' as
    descendants.

    Note: The aim of the style is to position the element to occupy the same space
    as its ::page-transition-container element and provide isolation for
    blending.

    Issue: Isolation is only necessary to get the right cross-fade between
    incoming and outgoing image pixels. Would it be simpler to always add it
    and try to optimize in the implementation?

: <dfn>::page-transition-outgoing-image( <<pt-tag-selector>> )</dfn>
::  One of these pseudo-elements exists
    for each element in the outgoing DOM being animated by the page transition,
    and is a [=replaced element=] displaying the outgoing element's snapshot image.
    It has [=natural dimensions=] equal to the snapshot's size.

    Its [=originating element=] is the ''::page-transition-image-wrapper()''
    pseudo-element with the same tag.

    The following [=user-agent origin=] styles apply to this element:

    <pre><code highlight=css>
    html::page-transition-outgoing-image(*) {
      position: absolute;
      inset-block-start: 0;
      inline-size: 100%;
      block-size: auto;

      animation-duration: inherit;
      animation-fill-mode: inherit;
    }
    </code></pre>

    Note: The aim of the style is to match the element's inline size while
    retaining the aspect ratio. It is also placed at the block start.

    In addition to above, styles in the [=user-agent origin=] add
    ''mix-blend-mode:plus-lighter'' to this pseudo element if the ancestor
    ''::page-transition-image-wrapper'' has both
    ''::page-transition-incoming-image'' and ''::page-transition-outgoing-image'' as
    descendants.

    Note: mix-blend-mode value of plus-lighter ensures that the blending of identical
    pixels from the outgoing and incoming images results in the same color value
    as those pixels.

    Additional [=user-agent origin=] styles added to animate these pseudo-elements
    are detailed in [=Animate a page transition=].

: <dfn>::page-transition-incoming-image( <<pt-tag-selector>> )</dfn>
::  Identical to ''::page-transition-outgoing-image()'',
    except it deals with the incoming element instead.

The precise tree structure, and in particular the order of sibling
pseudo-elements, is defined in the [=Create transition pseudo-elements=]
algorithm.

# Concepts # {#concepts}

## Phases ## {#phases-concept}

<dfn>Phases</dfn> represent an ordered sequence of states. Since [=phases=] are
ordered, prose can refer to phases <dfn for="phases">before</dfn> a particular
phase, meaning they appear earlier in the sequence, or <dfn
for="phases">after</dfn> a particular phase, meaning they appear later in the
sequence.

The initial phase is the first item in the sequence.

Note: For the most part, a developer using this API does not need to worry
about the different phases, since they progress automatically. It is, however,
important to understand what steps happen in each of the phases: when the
snapshots are captured, when pseudo-element DOM is created, etc. The
description of the phases below tries to be as precise as possible, with an
intent to provide an unambiguous set of steps for implementors to follow in
order to produce a spec-compliant implementation.

## The [=page-transition layer=] stacking layer ## {#page-transition-stacking-layer}

This specification introduces a stacking layer to the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/zindex.html">Elaborate description of Stacking Contexts</a>.

The ''::page-transition'' pseudo-element generates a new stacking context
called <dfn>page-transition layer</dfn> with the following characteristics:

1. Its parent stacking context is the root stacking context.

1. If the ''page-transition'' pseudo-element exists, a new stacking
    context is created for the
    <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-root">root</a>
    and <a href="https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#top-layer">top layer</a>
    elements.
    The ''page-transition layer'' is a sibling of this stacking context.

1. The ''page-transition layer'' paints after the stacking context for the
     <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-root">root</a>
    and <a href="https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#top-layer">top layer</a>
    elements.

Note: The intent of the feature is to be able to capture the contents of the
page, which includes the top layer elements. In order to accomplish that, the
''page-transition layer'' cannot be a part of the captured top layer context,
since that results in a circular dependency. Instead, this stacking context is a
sibling of other page contents.

Issue: Do we need to clarify that the stacking context for the root and top
layer elements has filters and effects coming from the root element's style?

## [=Captured elements=] ## {#captured-elements}

A <dfn>captured element</dfn> is a [=struct=] with the following:

<dl dfn-for="captured element">
    : <dfn>outgoing image</dfn>
    :: an image or null. Initially null.

        Issue: The type of "image" needs to be linked or defined.

    : <dfn>outgoing styles</dfn>
    :: a set of styles or null. Initially null.

        Issue: The type of "a set of styles" needs to be linked or defined.

    : <dfn>incoming element</dfn>
    :: an element or null. Initially null.

        Issue: The type of "element" needs to be linked or defined.
</dl>

## Additions to {{Document}} ## {#additions-to-document}

A {{Document}} additionally has:

<dl dfn-for="document">
    : <dfn>active DOM transition</dfn>
    :: a {{ViewTransition}} or null. Initially null.

    : <dfn>transition suppressing rendering</dfn>
    :: a boolean. Initially false.
</dl>

# API # {#api}

## Additions to {{Document}} ## {#additions-to-document-api}

<script type=idl>
partial interface Document {
    ViewTransition createTransition(ViewTransitionInit init);
};

dictionary ViewTransitionInit {
    required UpdateDOMCallback updateDOM;
};

callback UpdateDOMCallback = Promise<any> ();
</script>

### {{Document/createTransition()}} ### {#ViewTransition-prepare}

<div algorithm>
    The [=method steps=] for
    <dfn method for=Document>createTransition(|init|)</dfn>
    are as follows:

    1. Let |transition| be a new {{ViewTransition}} object in [=this's=] [=relevant Realm=].

    1. Set |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/DOM update callback=] to |init|[{{ViewTransitionInit/updateDOM}}].

    1. Let |document| be [=this's=] [=relevant global object's=] [=associated document=].

    1. If |document|'s [=active DOM transition=] is not null, then [=skip the page transition=] |document|'s [=active DOM transition=]
        with an "{{AbortError}}" {{DOMException}} in [=this's=] [=relevant Realm=].

        Note: This can result in two asynchronous [=ViewTransition/DOM update
        callbacks=] running concurrently. One for the |document|'s current
        [=active DOM transition=], and another for this |transition|. As per
        the [design of this feature](#transitions-as-enhancements), it's
        assumed that the developer is using another feature or framework to
        correctly schedule these DOM changes.

    1. Set |document|'s [=active DOM transition=] to |transition|.

        Note: The process continues in [=perform an outgoing capture=] which is executed at the next [=rendering-opportunity=].

    1. Return |transition|.
</div>

<div class=example>
    If the default animations for the page transition are acceptable,
    then kicking off a transition
    requires nothing more than setting 'page-transition-tag' in the page's CSS,
    and a single line of script to start it:

    <pre highlight=js>
        document.createTransition({
            updateDOM() {
                coolFramework.changeTheDOMToPageB();
            }
        });
    </pre>

    If more precise management is needed, however,
    transition elements can be managed in script:

    <pre highlight=js>
        async function doTransition() {
            // Specify "outgoing" elements. The tag is used to match against
            // "incoming" elements they should transition to, and to refer to
            // the transitioning pseudo-element.
            document.querySelector('.old-message').style.pageTransitionTag = 'message';

            const transition = document.createTransition({
                async updateDOM() {
                    // This callback is invoked by the browser when "outgoing"
                    // capture finishes and the DOM can be switched to the new
                    // state. No frames are rendered until this callback returns.

                    // DOM changes may be asynchronous
                    await coolFramework.changeTheDOMToPageB();

                    // Tagging elements during the updateDOM() callback marks them as
                    // "incoming", to be matched up with the same-tagged "outgoing"
                    // elements marked previously and transitioned between.
                    document.querySelector('.new-message').style.pageTransitionTag =
                        'message';
                },
            });

            // When ready resolves, all pseudo-elements for this transition have
            // been generated.
            // They can now be accessed in script to set up custom animations.
            await transition.ready;

            document.documentElement.animate(keyframes, {
                ...animationOptions,
                pseudoElement: '::page-transition-container(message)',
            });

            // When the finished promise resolves, that means the transition is
            // finished.
            await transition.finished;
        }
    </pre>
</div>

## The {{ViewTransition}} interface ## {#the-domtransition-interface}

<script type=idl>

    Note: These steps will be added to the [=update the rendering=] in the HTML spec.
        As such, the prose style is written to match other steps in that algorithm.
</div>

<div algorithm="suppress rendering">
    Issue: Define where this sits within the [=update the rendering=] steps.

    1. For each {{Document}} in <var ignore>docs</var> with a [=document/transition suppressing rendering=] of true:

        Issue: Define this behavior. Lifecycle updates can still be triggered
        via script APIs which query style or layout information but no visual updates
        are presented to the user. Is this the same behavior as render-blocking?

        Issue: How should input be handled when in this state? The last frame presented
        to the user will not reflect the DOM state as it asynchronously switches to
        the new version.

        Note: The aim is to prevent unintended DOM updates from being presented to the
        user after a cached snapshot for the elements has been captured. We wait for

        1. Let |transitionTag| be the [=computed value=] of 'page-transition-tag' for |element|.

        1. If |transitionTag| is ''page-transition-tag/none'',

        1. Set |capture|'s [=outgoing image=] to the result of [=capturing the image=] of |element|.

        1. Set |capture|'s [=outgoing styles=] to the following:

                although the render steps in the HTML spec act as if it's synchronous.

        1. If |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/phase=] is "`done`", then abort these steps.

## [=Capture the image=] ## {#capture-the-image-algorithm}

<div algorithm>
    To <dfn lt="capture the image|capturing the image">capture the image</dfn> given an {{Element}} |element|, perform the following steps.
    They return an image.

    1. Render the referenced element and its descendants,
        at the same size that they would be in the document,
        over an infinite transparent canvas with the following characteristics:

        * The origin of |element|'s [=ink overflow rectangle=] is anchored to canvas origin.

        * If the referenced element has a transform applied to it (or its ancestors),
            then the transform is ignored.

            Note: This transform is applied to the snapshot using the `transform` property of the associated ''::page-transition-container'' pseudo-element.

        * [=list/For each=] |descendant| of [=shadow-including descendant=] {{Element}} and [=pseudo-element=] of |element|,
            if |descendant| has a [=computed value=] of 'page-transition-tag' that is not ''page-transition-tag/none'',
            then skip painting |descendant|.

            Note: This is necessary since the descendant will generate its own snapshot which will be displayed and animated independently.

            Issue: Refactor this so the algorithm takes a set of elements that will be captured. This centralizes the logic for deciding if an element should be included or not.

    1. Let |interestRectangle| be the result of [=computing the interest rectangle=] for |element|.

        Note: The |interestRectangle| is the subset of |element|'s [=ink overflow rectangle=] that should be captured.
            This is required for cases where an element's ink overflow rectangle needs to be clipped because of hardware constraints.
            For example, if it exceeds the maximum texture size.

    1. Return the portion of the canvas within |interestRectangle| as an image.
        The natural size of the image is equal to the |interestRectangle| bounds.

        1. For each |animation| that contains at least one [=animation effect=]
            whose [=effect target=] is |element| and whose associated [=animation timeline=]

            Issue: There needs to be a definition/link for "remove".

            Issue: There needs to be a definition/link for "associated".

        1. Set |document|'s [=document/active DOM transition=] to null.

        1. [=Resolve=] |transition|'s[=ViewTransition/finished promise=].

        1. Return.

    1. [=map/For each=] |tag| -> |capturedElement| of |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/tagged elements=]:

        1. If |capturedElement| has an "incoming element", run [=capture the image=]
            on |capturedElement|'s "incoming element" and update the displayed
            image for ''::page-transition-incoming-image'' with the tag |tag|.

            At the [=user-agent origin=],
            set |incoming|'s 'object-view-box' property
            to a value that when applied to |incoming|,
            will cause the view box to coincide with "incoming element"'s [=border box=]
            in the image.

    1. [=Assert=]: |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/phase=] is [=phases/before=] "`dom-update-callback-called`".

    1. Let |callbackPromise| be the result of [=/invoking=] |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/DOM update callback=].

Security Considerations</h2>

The images generated using [=capture the image=] algorithm could contain cross-origin data (if the Document is embedding cross-origin resources) or sensitive information like visited links. The implementations must ensure this data can not be accessed by the Document. This should be feasible since access to this data should already be prevented in the default rendering of the Document.
