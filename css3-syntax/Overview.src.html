<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/">CSS</a> is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc. 
		This module describes, in general terms, the basic structure and syntax of CSS stylesheets.
		It defines, in detail, the syntax and parsing of CSS - how to turn a stream of bytes into a meaningful stylesheet.

	<p>
		This module defines the syntax and parsing of CSS stylesheets.
		It supersedes the lexical scanner and grammar defined in CSS 2.1.

<h2 id='syntax-description'>
Description of CSS's Syntax</h2>

	<p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

	<p>
		A CSS document is a series of <i>rules</i>, 
		which apply CSS properties to elements in the source document, 
		and <i>at-rules</i>, 
		which define special processing rules or values for the CSS document.

	<p>
		A <dfn>rule</dfn> starts with a selector
		(defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/">Selectors specification</a>),
		then has a {}-wrapped block containing a sequence of declarations.
		The selector specifies which elements the declarations will apply to.
		Each declaration has a property name, 
		followed by a colon and the property value,
		and finished with a semicolon.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			A typical rule might look something like this:

		<pre>
p > a { 
	color: blue;
	text-decoration: underline;
}</pre>

		<p>
			In the above rule, "<code>p > a</code>" is the selector,
			which, if the source document is HTML,
			selects any <code>&lt;a></code> elements that are children of a <code>&lt;p></code> element.

		<p>
			"<code>color: blue;</code>" is a declaration specifying that, 
			for the elements that match the selector,
			their 'color' property should have the value ''blue''.
			Similiarly, their 'text-decoration' property should have the value ''underline''.
	</div>

	<p>
		<dfn title="at-rule">At-rules</dfn> are all different, but they have a basic structure in common.
		They start with an "@" character followed by their name.
		Some <i>at-rules</i> are simple statements,
		with their name followed by more CSS values to specify their behavior,
		and finally ended by a semicolon.
		Others are blocks;
		they can have CSS values following their name, 
		but they end with a {}-wrapped block,
		similar to a <i>rule</i>.
		Even the contents of these blocks are specific to the given <i>at-rule</i>:
		sometimes they contain a sequence of declarations, like a <i>rule</i>;
		other times, they may contain additional blocks, or at-rules, or other structures altogether.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			Here are several examples of <i>at-rules</i> that illustrate the varied syntax they may contain.

		<pre>@import "my-styles.css";</pre>

		<p>
			The ''@import'' <i>at-rule</i> is a simple statement.
			After its name, it takes a single string or ''url()'' function to indicate the stylesheet that it should import.

		<pre>
@page :left {
	margin-left: 4cm;
	margin-right: 3cm;
}</pre>

		<p>
			The ''@page'' <i>at-rule</i> consists of an optional page selector (the ":left" pseudoclass),
			followed by a block of properties that apply to the page when printed.
			In this way, it's very similar to a normal <i>rule</i>,
			except that its properties don't apply to any "element",
			but rather the page itself.

		<pre>
@media print {
	body { font-size: 10pt }
}</pre>

		<p>
			The ''@media'' <i>at-rule</i> begins with a media type
			and a list of optional media queries.
			Its block contains entire rules,
			which are only applied when the ''@media''s conditions are fulfilled.
	</div>

	<p>
		Property names and <i>at-rule</i> names are always <b>identifiers</b>,
		which have to start with a letter or a hyphen followed by a letter,
		and then can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores.
		You can include any character at all,
		even ones that CSS uses in its syntax,
		by escaping it with a backslash (\) or by using a hexadecimal escape.

	<p>
		The syntax of selectors is defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/">Selectors spec</a>.
		Similarly, the syntax of the wide variety of CSS values is defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/">Values &amp; Units spec</a>.
		The special syntaxes of individual <i>at-rules</i> can be found in the specs that define them.
	
<h2>
Parsing</h2>

	<p>
		User agents must use the parsing rules described in this section to generate the CSSOM trees from text/css resources. 
		Together, these rules define what is referred to as the CSS parser.

	<p>
		This specification defines the parsing rules for CSS documents, whether they are syntactically correct or not. 
		Certain points in the parsing algorithm are said to be parse errors. 
		The error handling for parse errors is well-defined: 
		user agents must either act as described below when encountering such problems, 
		or must abort processing at the first error that they encounter for which they do not wish to apply the rules described below.

	<p>
		Conformance checkers must report at least one parse error condition to the user if one or more parse error conditions exist in the document and must not report parse error conditions if none exist in the document. 
		Conformance checkers may report more than one parse error condition if more than one parse error condition exists in the document. 
		Conformance checkers are not required to recover from parse errors.

<h3>
Overview of the Parsing Model</h3>

	<p>
		The input to the CSS parsing process consists of a stream of Unicode code points, 
		which is passed through a tokenization stage followed by a tree construction stage. 
		The output is a CSSStyleSheet object.

	<p class='note'>
		Implementations that do not support scripting do not have to actually create a CSSOM CSSStyleSheet object, 
		but the CSSOM tree in such cases is still used as the model for the rest of the specification.

<h3>
The input byte stream</h3>

	<p>
		The stream of Unicode code points that comprises the input to the tokenization stage will be initially seen by the user agent as a stream of bytes 
		(typically coming over the network or from the local file system). 
		The bytes encode the actual characters according to a particular character encoding, 
		which the user agent must use to decode the bytes into characters.

	<p>
		The <i>encoding sniffing algorithm</i> defined below is used to determine the character encoding.

	<p>
		Given an encoding, 
		the bytes in the input byte stream must be converted to Unicode code points for the tokenizer's input stream, 
		as described by the rules for that encoding, 
		except that the leading U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK character, if any, 
		must not be stripped by the encoding layer (it is stripped by the rule below).

	<p>
		Bytes or sequences of bytes in the original byte stream that could not be converted to Unicode code points 
		must be converted to U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs. 
		Specifically, 
		if the encoding is UTF-8, 
		the bytes must be decoded with the error handling defined in this specification.

	<p class='note'>
		Bytes or sequences of bytes in the original byte stream that did not conform to the encoding specification 
		(e.g. invalid UTF-8 byte sequences in a UTF-8 input byte stream) 
		are errors that conformance checkers are expected to report.

<h4>
Determining the character encoding</h4>

	<div class='issue'>
		<p>
			General algorithm:

		<ol>
			<li>
				If the stylesheet is embedded, 
				the charset is the charset of the outer document.

			<li>
				If the resource carried a Charset header,
				and the value of the header is a valid charset,
				that's the charset of the stylesheet.

			<li>
				If the document contains an @charset rule at the very top
				(specify how to parse this in the presence of arbitrary charsets)
				and it specifies a valid charset,
				that's the charset of the stylesheet.

			<li>
				The charset is UTF-8.
		</ol>
	</div>

<h4>
Preprocessing the input stream</h4>

	<p>
		The input stream consists of the characters pushed into it as the input byte stream is decoded.

	<p>
		One leading U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK character must be ignored if any are present in the input stream.

	<p class='note'>
		The requirement to strip a U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK character regardless of whether that character was used to determine the byte order is a willful violation of Unicode, motivated by a desire to increase the resilience of user agents in the face of naïve transcoders.

	<p>
		U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters and U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters are treated specially. All CR characters must be converted to LF characters, and any LF characters that immediately follow a CR character must be ignored. Thus, newlines in CSS stylesheets are represented by LF characters, and there are never any CR characters in the input to the tokenization stage.

	<p>
		The <dfn>next input character</dfn> is the first character in the input stream that has not yet been consumed or explicitly ignored by the requirements in this section. Initially, the <i>next input character</i> is the first character in the input. The <dfn>current input character</dfn> is the last character to have been consumed.

	<p>
		The "EOF" character in the tables below is a conceptual character representing the end of the input stream.

<h3>
Parse State</h3>

	<p>
		...

<h3>
Tokenization</h3>

	<p>
		Implementations must act as if they used the following state machine to tokenize CSS. 
		The state machine must start in the <i>data state</i>. 
		Most states consume a single character, 
		which may have various side-effects, 
		and either switches the state machine to a new state to reconsume the same character, 
		or switches it to a new state to consume the next character, 
		or stays in the same state to consume the next character. 
		Some states have more complicated behavior and can consume several characters before switching to another state.

	<p>
		The output of the tokenization step is a series of zero or more of the following tokens:
		identifier,
		function,
		at-keyword,
		hash,
		string,
		bad-string,
		url,
		bad-url,
		delim,
		number,
		percentage,
		dimension,
		unicode-range,
		whitespace,
		comment,
		cdo,
		cdc,
		colon,
		semicolon,
		[,
		],
		(,
		),
		{,
		}.

	<p>
		Identifier, function, at-keyword, hash, string, and url tokens have a value composed of zero or more characters.
		Delim tokens have a value composed of a single character.
		Number, percentage, and dimension tokens have a representation composed of 1 or more character, a numeric value, and a type flag set to either "integer" or "number".  The type flag defaults to "integer" if not otherwise set.
		Dimension tokens additionally have a unit composed of one or more characters.
		Unicode-range tokens have a range of characters.

	<p>
		The tokenizer state machine consists of the states defined in the following subsections.

<h4>
Tokenizer Flags</h4>

	<p>
		The tokenizer can be run with any of several flags that alter its behavior.

	<dl>
		<dt>the <dfn>supports scientific notation</dfn> flag
		<dd>
			This flag is set if the tokenizer supports scientific notation in numbers.
			When this is set, a sequence of characters like "12e3" will tokenize
			as a number token with the value "12000".
			(Without the flag, they would tokenize as a dimension token with value "12" and unit "e3".)

			<p>
				Currently, this flag is only set when parsing SVG presentational attributes.

		<dt>the <dfn>transform function whitespace</dfn> flag
		<dd>
			This flag is set when parsing SVG's <code>transform</code> attribute.
			When this is set, whitespace is allowed between the name of a transform function and its opening parenthesis.
	</dl>

<h4>

		the unicode-range token's range is empty.

	<p>
		If the <i>end of the range</i> is defined,
		and it is less than the <i>start of the range</i>,
		the unicode-range token's range is empty.

	<p>
		If the <i>end of the range</i> is not defined,
		the unicode-range token's range
		is the single character whose codepoint is the <i>start of the range</i>.

	<p>
		Otherwise,
		if the <i>end of the range</i> is greater than
		the <i>maximum allowed codepoint</i>,
		change it to the <i>maximum allowed codepoint</i>.
		The unicode-range token's range
		is all characters between

<h3>
Changes from CSS 2.1 Tokenizer</h3>

	<p>
		<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

	<p>
		Here are the changes that I know that I've made to the tokenizer of 2.1.
		If there are changes not present here, 
		please let me know
		as they may be unintentional.

	<p>
		Note that the point of this spec is to match reality;
		changes from CSS2.1's tokenizer are nearly always because the tokenizer specified something that doesn't match actual browser behavior,
		or left something unspecified.
		If some detail doesn't match browsers,
		please let me know
		as it's almost certainly unintentional.

	<ol>
		<li>
			The DASHMATCH and INCLUDES tokens have been removed.
			They can instead be handled simply by having them parse as DELIM tokens.
			It was weird to privilege just those two types of attribute equality operators,
			when Selectors 3 adds several more.

		<li>
			The BAD-URI token (now bad-url) is "self-contained".
			In other words, once the tokenizer realizes it's in a bad-url rather than a url token,
			it just seeks forward to look for the closing ),
			ignoring everything else.
			This behavior is simpler than treating it like a FUNCTION token
			and paying attention to opened blocks and such.
			Only WebKit exhibits this behavior,
			but it doesn't appear that we've gotten any compat bugs from it.

		<li>
			The number, percentage, and dimension tokens have been changed
			to include the preceding +/- sign as part of their value
			(rather than as a separate DELIM token that needs to be manually handled every time the token is mentioned in other specs).
			The only consequence of this is that comments can no longer be inserted between the sign and the number.

		<li>
			Several flags have been added for SVG-compatible tokenizing, 
			so that a single state machine can be used for both "vanilla" and SVG CSS parsing.

	</ol>

<h3>
Tree Construction</h3>

	<p>
		The input to the tree construction stage is a sequence of tokens from the tokenization stage.
		The output is a tree of items
		with a stylesheet at the root
		and all other nodes being at-rules, style rules, or declarations.

	<p>
		The construction of this stylesheet does not take into account unrecognized items,
		like unknown properties or at-rules.
		It simply produces a tree of rules according to the fundamental syntax of CSS.
		Unrecognized or misplaced rules are handled in the CSSOM Construction stage.

	<p>
		The items that can appear in the tree are a mixture of basic tokens
		and new objects:

	<dl>
		<dt>stylesheet
		<dd>
			A stylesheet has a value consisting of a list of at-rules and style rules.

		<dt>at-rule
		<dd>
			An at-rule has a name,
			a prelude consisting of a list of primitives,
			and a value consisting of a list of at-rules, style rules, or declarations.

		<dt>style rule</dt>
		<dd>
			A style rule has 
			a selector consisting of a list of primitives,
			and a value consisting of a list of at-rules or declarations.

		<dt>declaration
		<dd>
			A declaration has a name
			and a value consisting of a list of primitives.

		<dt>primitive
		<dd>
			A primitive is one of the preserved tokens,
			a function,
			or a simple block.

		<dt>preserved tokens
		<dd>
			The tokens that can appear in the tree are:
			identifier,
			hash,
			string,
			url,
			delim,
			number,
			percentage,
			dimension,
			unicode-range,
			whitespace,
			comment,
			cdo,
			cdc,
			colon,
			semicolon,
			at-keyword,
			],
			),
			and }.

			<p class='note'>
				This means that the following tokens emitted by the tokenizer stage will <strong>not</strong> appear in the stylesheet object:
				function,
				bad-string,
				bad-url,
				[,
				(,
				{.
				<span class='issue'>I need to make sure this is true.</span>

		<dt>function
		<dd>
			A function has a name,
			and a list of arguments.
			Each argument is a list of primitives.

		<dt>simple block
		<dd>
			A simple block has an associated token (either a [, (, or { token)
			and a value consisting of a list of primitives.
	</dl>

	<div class='issue'>
		<p>
			TODO:

		<ul>
			<li>
				Make sure that I properly handle the case where the top element in the stack isn't a stylesheet,
				such as when parsing the <code>style</code> attribute
				(there, the top element is a style rule,
				and we start by entering the declaration mode).

			<li>
				Handle the an+b production somehow.
				Maybe just define it in property grammar terms?
		</ul>
	</div>

<h4>
Definitions</h4>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn>current input token</dfn>
		<dd>
			The token currently being operated on, from the list of tokens produced by the tokenizer.

		<dt><dfn>next input token</dfn>
		<dd>
			The token following the <i>current input token</i> in the list of tokens produced by the tokenizer.
			If there isn't a token following the <i>current input token</i>,
			the <i>next input token</i> is an EOF token.

		<dt><dfn>stack of open rules</dfn>
		<dd>
			A stack of rules.  
			This stack always contains the stylesheet object at the bottom of the stack, 
			gains additional rules as block are opened,
			and loses them when blocks are closed.

		<dt><dfn>current rule</dfn>
		<dd>
			The topmost rule in the <i>stack of open rules</i>.

		<dt><dfn>current declaration</dfn>
		<dd>
			The declaration currently being built.
			There may or may not be a current declaration at any given time,
			but there is never more than one.

		<dt><dfn>rule-filled</dfn>
		<dd>
			An at-rule that takes a block,
			and within that block accepts at-rules and/or style rules 
			(which encompasses more than just style rules, such as keyframe rules),
			is called <i>rule-filled</i>.
			Examples of <i>rule-filled</i> at-rules are ''@media'' and ''@keyframes''.

		<dt><dfn>declaration-filled</dfn>
		<dd>
			An at-rule that takes a block,
			and within that block accepts at-rules and/or declarations,
			is called <i>declaration-filled</i>.
			Examples of <i>declaration-filled</i> at-rules are ''@font-face'' and ''@page''.

		Repeatedly consume the <i>next input token</i> and process it as follows:

	<dl>
		<dt>EOF token
		<dt><i>ending token</i>
		<dd>
			Return the block.

		<dt>anything else
		<dd>
			<i>Consume a primitive</i>
			and append the returned value
			to the value of the <i>current block</i>.
	</dl>


<h4>
<dfn>Consume a function</dfn></h4>

	<p>
		This section describes how to <i>consume a function</i>.

	<p>
		Create a function with a name equal to the value of the <i>current input token</i>.
		Create an argument, 
		called the <i>current argument</i>, 
		which is initially empty.

	<p>
		Repeatedly consume the <i>next input token</i> and process it as follows:

	<dl>
		<dt>EOF token
		<dt>) token
		<dd>
			Append the <i>current argument</i> to the function's argument list.
			Return the function.

		<dt>delim token with the value ","
		<dd>
			Append the <i>current argument</i> to the function's argument list.
			Create a new <i>current argument</i> which is initially empty.

		<dt>anything else
		<dd>
			<i>Consume a primitive</i>
			and append the returned value
			to the value of the <i>current argument</i>.
	</dl>


<h4>
<dfn>Switch to the current rule's content mode</dfn></h4>

	<p>
		This section describes how to <i>switch to the current rule's content mode</i>.
		It is invoked whenever a declaration or rule has been successfully completed,
		or when an error has finished recovery.

	<p>
		If the <i>current rule</i> is a style rule or a <i>declaration-filled</i> at-rule,
		switch to the <i>declaration mode</i>.

	<p>
		If the <i>current rule</i> is a <i>rule-filled</i> at-rule,
		switch to the <i>rule mode</i>.

	<p>
		If the <i>current rule</i> is a stylesheet,
		switch to the <i>top-level mode</i>.


<h4>
<dfn>Pop the current rule</dfn></h4>

	<p>
		This section describes how to <i>pop the current rule</i>.
		It is invoked whenever a rule is "finished" parsing
		and can be made part of its parent rule.

	<p>
		First, validate the <i>current rule</i> according to the appropriate grammar rules.
		If the rule does not match its required grammar,
		discard it.

	<p>
		Otherwise, pop the <i>current rule</i> from the <i>stack of open rules</i>
		and append it to the value of the new <i>current rule</i>.


<h4>
<dfn>Finish parsing</dfn></h4>

	<p>
		This section describes how to <i>finish parsing</i>.
		It is invoked whenever an EOF token is encountered.

	<p>
		If there is a <i>current declaration</i>,
		and it is grammatically valid,
		append it to the value of the <i>current rule</i>.

	<p>
		While there's more than one rule on the <i>stack of open rules</i>,
		<i>pop the current rule</i>.

	<p>
		Finally, return the <i>current rule</i> as the result of parsing.


<h3>
Changes from CSS 2.1 Core Grammar</h3>

	<p>
		<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

	<p>
		Here are the changes that I know that I've made to the Core Grammar of 2.1.
		If there are changes not present here, 
		please let me know
		as they may be unintentional.

	<p>
		Note that the point of this spec is to match reality;
		changes from CSS2.1's Core Grammar are nearly always because the Core Grammar specified something that doesn't match actual browser behavior,
		or left something unspecified.
		If some detail doesn't match browsers,
		please let me know
		as it's almost certainly unintentional.

	<ol>
		<li>
			No whitespace or comments are allowed between the DELIM(!) and IDENT(important) tokens 
			when processing an !important directive at the end of a style rule.
	</ol>

<h2 id="conformance">
Conformance</h2>

<h3 id="conventions">
Document conventions</h3>

	<p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
	descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
	“MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
	“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
	document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
	However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
	letters in this specification.
	
	<p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
	explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>
	
	<p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
	or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
	like this:
	
	<div class="example">
		<p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
	normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:
	
	<p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance classes</h3>

	<p>Conformance to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
	is defined for three conformance classes:
	<dl>
		<dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
			style sheet</a>.
		<dt><dfn>renderer</dfn>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
			documents that use them.
		<dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that writes a style sheet.
	</dl>
	
	<p>A style sheet is conformant to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
	if all of its statements that use syntax defined in this module are valid
	according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each
	feature defined in this module.
	
	<p>A renderer is conformant to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
	if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
	appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
	by <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var> by parsing them correctly
	and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
	UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
	does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
	required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
	
	<p>An authoring tool is conformant to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
	if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
	generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
	this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
	as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial implementations</h3>

	<p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
	assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
	treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
	as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
	and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
	support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
	ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
	multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
	(as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
	be ignored.</p>
	
<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental implementations</h3>

	<p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
	reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
	syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.
	
	<p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
	in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
	experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
	use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
	W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
	in the draft.
	</p>
 
<h3 id="testing">
Non-experimental implementations</h3>

	<p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
	non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
	release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
	can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.
	
	<p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
	implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
	CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
	testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
	releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
	submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
	Working Group.
	
	<p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
	can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
	Questions should be directed to the
	<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
	mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR exit criteria</h3>

	<p class=issue>[Change or remove the following CR exit criteria if
	the spec is not a module, but, e.g., a Note or a profile. This text was <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/actions/44"> decided on 2008-06-04.</a>]</p>

	<p>
	For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
	there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
	of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
	products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
	a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
	following terms:
	
	<dl>
		<dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
		different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
		used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
		have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
		exempt from this requirement.
	
		<dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
		official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
		browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
		suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
		agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
		if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
		must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
		equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
		interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
		available for the purposes of peer review.
	
		<dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:
	
		<ol class=inline>
			<li>implements the specification.
	
			<li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
			be a shipping product or other publicly available version
			(i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
			Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
			feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
			demonstrate stability.
	
			<li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
			to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
			going forward).
		</ol>
	</dl>
	
	<p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
	six months.
