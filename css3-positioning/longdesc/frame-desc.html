        <h1>Long description for frame layout example</h1>
        <p>This diagram illustrates a frame-like layout with 'position: fixed'.</p>
        <p>
            The illustration shows a four-panel frameset. The top panel ("header") covers the entire 
            width of the frameset and takes up 15% of the vertical space. Below it on the left is 
            the "sidebar", which is 10em wide; it's height is automatically calculated. To the right 
            of the sidebar and below the header is the "main" area, whose dimensions are computed 
            based on remaining available space. Finally, at the bottom, the "footer" area is 100px 
            high and covers the entire width of the frameset.
        </p>
        <p>Each area is labeled and dimensions that are not 'auto' are indicated.</p>
