Abstract: <a>Selectors</a> are patterns that match against elements in a tree, and as such form one of several technologies that can be used to select nodes in a document. Selectors have been optimized for use with HTML and XML, and are designed to be usable in performance-critical code. They are a core component of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (Cascading Style Sheets), which uses Selectors to bind style properties to elements in the document.
Abstract: Selectors Level 5 describes the selectors that already exist in [[!selectors-4]], and further introduces new selectors for CSS and other languages that may need them.

Introduction</h2>

	ISSUE: <strong>This is a diff spec against
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/">Selectors Level 4</a>.</strong>

<h3 id="placement">
Module Interactions</h3>

	This module extends
	the set of selectors defined for CSS in [[selectors-4]].

<h2 id="location">
Location Pseudo-classes</h2>

<h3 id="local-pseudo">
The Local Link Pseudo-class '':local-link''</h3>

	The <dfn id='local-link-pseudo'>:local-link</dfn> pseudo-class allows authors to style
	[[selectors-4#the-any-link-pseudo|hyperlinks]]
	based on the users current location within a site and to
	differentiate site-internal versus site-external links.

	The (non-functional) '':local-link'' pseudo-class represents an element that is
	the source anchor of a hyperlink whose target's absolute URL
	matches the element's own document URL.
	Any fragment identifiers are stripped before matching the document's URL against the link's URL;
	otherwise all portions of the URL are considered.

	<div class="example">
		For example, the following rule prevents links targeting the
		current page from being underlined when they are part of the
		navigation list:

		<pre>nav :local-link { text-decoration: none; } </pre>
	</div>

	As a functional pseudo-class,
	'':local-link()'' can also accept a non-negative integer as its sole argument,
	which, if the document's URL belongs to a hierarchical scheme,
	indicates the number of path levels to match:

	<ul>
		<li>'':local-link(0)'' represents a link element whose target is in the same origin as the document's URL
		<li>'':local-link(1)'' represents a link element whose target has the same origin and first path segment
		<li>'':local-link(2)'' represents a link element whose target has the same origin, first, and second path segments
		<li>etc.
	</ul>

	<div class="example">
		The following example styles all site-external links with a dashed
			underline.

		<pre>:not(:local-link(0)) { text-decoration-style: dashed; } </pre>
	</div>

	Path segments are portions of the URL's path that are separated by forward slashes (/).
	If a segment is missing from the document's URL,
	a pseudo-class requiring that segment to match does not match anything.

	<div class="example">
		So, given the links:

		<ol>
			<li><code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com">Home&lt;/a></code>
			<li><code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com/2011">2011&lt;/a></code>
			<li><code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com/2011/03">March&lt;/a></code>
			<li><code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com/2011/03/">March&lt;/a></code>
			<li><code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com/2011/03/21">21 March&lt;/a></code>
			<li><code>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com/2011/03/">March&lt;/a></code>
			<li><code>&lt;a href="http://example.com/2011/03/">March&lt;/a></code>
		</ol>

		and the styles:

		<ol type=A>
			 <li><code>a:local-link {...}</code>
			 <li><code>a:local-link(0) {...}</code>
			 <li><code>a:local-link(1) {...}</code>
			 <li><code>a:local-link(2) {...}</code>
			 <li><code>a:local-link(3) {...}</code>
			 <li><code>a:local-link(4) {...}</code>
		</ol>

		If the document's URL is <code>http://www.example.com/2011/03/</code>:

		<ol>
			<li>Link 1 would receive Style B
			<li>Link 2 would receive Styles B and C
			<li>Link 3 would receive Styles B, C, and D
			<li>Link 4 would also receive Styles A, B, C, D, and E
			<li>Link 5 would receive Styles B, C, and D
			<li>Link 6 would remain unstyled
			<li>Link 7 would remain unstyled
			<li>Style F would not be applied to anything
		</ol>
	</div>


		The "origin" of the URL is defined by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-4">RFC 6454, Section 4</a>.
		The username, password, query string, and fragment portions of the URL are not considered
		when matching against '':local-link(<var ignore>n</var>)''.
		If the document's URL does not belong to a hierarchical scheme,
		the functional pseudo-class matches nothing.

	<p class="issue">
		It's clear that, if the document URL has at least N segments,
		then '':local-link(N)'' only matches links whose URL has at least N segments.
		(This lets you assign consistent semantics to :local-link so that,
		for example, :local-link(2) means a "within-repo" link on GitHub.)
		What about if the document url has less than N segments,
		and the link is same-page?
		Should "null segments" count as matching, or not?

<h2 id="useraction-pseudos">
User Action Pseudo-classes</h2>

<h3 id="interest-pseudos">
The Interest Pseudo-classes: '':interest-source'' and '':interest-target''</h3>

	A common UI feature is the ability for the user to "show interest" in certain elements
	(an <dfn export>interest source</dfn>),
	and the UI to respond to that interest
	by showing additional information in another element
	(the <dfn export>interest target</dfn>),
	typically a popup.
	For example, hovering a username on a page
	might bring up an information card for that user;
	or long-pressing a link
	might bring up a preview of the link's destination.
	Whenever this happens, the first element

	Note: Exactly what elements are capable of being [=interest sources=],
	how they're linked to [=interest targets=],
	and how "interest" is shown
	are all [=host language=]-defined.
	In HTML, for example,
	this is done with the <{html-global/interestfor}> attribute
	to indicate an element capable of "showing interest"
	(being an [=interest source=],
	and that attribute points to another element
	intended to show the additional information
	(the associated [=interest target=])
	(usually a <{html-global/popover}> element).

	The <dfn>:interest-source</dfn> pseudo-class
	applies to an [=interest source=] element that the user is currently "showing interest" in,
	and the <dfn>:interest-target</dfn> pseudo-class
	applies to the associated [=interest target=]
	of an element matching '':interest-source''.

	Note: '':interest-source'' only matches an [=interest source=]
	the user is <em>currently</em> interested in,
	not any element that can <em>potentially</em> have interest shown in it.
	In HTML, for example,
	just having the <{html-global/interestfor}> attribute
	does not make an element match this pseudo-class;
	the user has to actually indicate interest in it too.
	Similarly, '':interest-target'' only matches an [=interest target=]
	that is linked to an element the user is <em>currently</em> interested in,
	not any element pointed to by an <{html-global/interestfor}> attribute.

<h2 id="input-pseudos">
The Input Pseudo-classes</h2>

<h3 id="ui-validity">
Input Value-checking</h3>

<h4 id="blank">
The Empty-Value Pseudo-class: '':blank''</h4>

	The <dfn id="blank-pseudo">:blank</dfn> pseudo-class
	applies to user-input elements whose input value is empty
	(consists of the empty string or otherwise null input).

	<div class="note">
		Roughly speaking, if a human looked at a printout of the form
		and would say it’s blank,
		it matches '':blank''.

		A rule of thumb for interpreting '':blank'' on form controls is:

		* If the control always submits,
			and would do so with an empty string, it matches '':blank''.
			(Such as HTML’s <code>&lt;input type=text></code> when its value is empty.)
		* If it sometimes submits, and is set to not submit, it matches '':blank''.
			(Such as HTML’s <code>&lt;input type=checkbox></code> when not checked.)
		* If it's an “action button”
			(rather than a “toggle button” that represents a state)
			such as <code>&lt;button></code>, <code>&lt;input type=submit></code>, etc.,
			it never matches '':blank''.

		Host languages can specify more precise rules
		for when form controls match '':blank''.
	</div>

<h2 id="time-pseudos">
Time-dimensional Pseudo-classes</h2>

	These pseudo-classes classify elements with respect to the
	currently-displayed or active position in some timeline, such as
	during speech rendering of a document, or during the display of
	a video using WebVTT to render subtitles.

	CSS does not define this timeline;
	the host language must do so.
	If there is no timeline defined for an element,
	these pseudo-classes must not match the element.

	Note: Ancestors of a '':current'' element are also '':current'',
	but ancestors of a '':past'' or '':future'' element are not necessarily '':past'' or '':future'' as well.
	A given element matches at most one of '':current'', '':past'', or '':future''.

<h3 id="the-current-pseudo">
The Current-element Pseudo-class: '':current''</h3>

	The <dfn id='current-pseudo'>:current</dfn> pseudo-class represents the
	element, or an ancestor of the element, that is currently being displayed.

	Its alternate form <dfn>:current()</dfn>
	takes a list of <a>compound selectors</a> as its argument:
	it represents the '':current'' element that matches the argument
	or, if that does not match,
	the innermost ancestor of the '':current'' element that does.
	(If neither the '':current'' element nor its ancestors match the argument, then the selector does not represent anything.)

	<div class="example">
		For example, the following rule will highlight whichever paragraph
		or list item is being read aloud in a speech rendering of the document:

		<pre>
		:current(p, li, dt, dd) {
		  background: yellow;
		}
		</pre>
	</div>

<h3 id="the-past-pseudo">
The Past-element Pseudo-class: '':past''</h3>

	The <dfn id='past-pseudo'>:past</dfn> pseudo-class represents any element that is
	defined to occur entirely prior to a '':current'' element.
	For example, the WebVTT spec defines the '':past'' pseudo-class <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/#the-past-and-future-pseudo-classes">relative to the current playback position of a media element</a>.
	If a time-based order of elements is not defined by the document language,
	then this represents any element that is a (possibly indirect) previous
	sibling of a '':current'' element.

<h3 id="the-future-pseudo">
The Future-element Pseudo-class: '':future''</h3>

	The <dfn id='future-pseudo'>:future</dfn> pseudo-class represents any element that is
	defined to occur entirely after a '':current'' element.
	For example, the WebVTT spec defines the '':future'' pseudo-class <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/#the-past-and-future-pseudo-classes">relative to the current playback position of a media element</a>.
	If a time-based order of elements is not defined by the document language,
	then this represents any element that is a (possibly indirect) next
	sibling of a '':current'' element.

<h2 id="custom-state">
Exposing custom state: the '':state()'' pseudo-class</h2>

	The <dfn selector id="state-pseudo">:state( <<ident>> )</dfn> pseudo-class
	matches [=custom elements=]
	whose [=states set=] contains a string
	that [=string/is=] the selector's argument's value.

	<wpt>
		parsing/parse-state.html
	</wpt>

	<!-- Using <<ident>>, rather than <<custom-ident>>,
	     to avoid excluding the CSS-wide keywords. -->

	Note: The "[=string/is=]" matching behavior compares strings by codepoint;
	notably, it's case-sensitive.
	So if "foo" is in the [=states set=], '':state(FOO)'' will <em>not</em> match.

	The exact matching behavior of '':state()'' pseudo-class
	is defined by the host language.
	For clarity, the concepts explaining this pseudo-class
	link to the HTML definition;
	see <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-state-pseudo-class">HTML's definition</a> for more detail.
	Other host languages must define how this pseudo-class matches.

<h2 id="headings">
Heading Structures: the heading pseudo-classes '':heading'', and '':heading()''</h2>

	The (non-functional) <dfn id='heading-pseudo'>:heading</dfn> pseudo-class
	matches an element which has a <a>heading level</a>, with respect to the
	semantics defined by the document language (e.g. [[HTML5]]).

	The [=specificity=] of '':heading'' is that of a class.

	<div class="example">
		For example, the following sheet contains a rule applying to all heading
		elements in the current page:

		<pre>:heading { text-decoration: underline; }</pre>
	</div>

	As a functional pseudo-class,
	<dfn id='heading-functional-pseudo' lt=':heading()'>:heading()</dfn>
	notation represents elements that have a <a>heading level</a> among matching
	any of the provided <var>integer</var> values.
	The syntax is:

	<pre class=prod>
		:heading() = :heading( <<level>># )
	</pre>

	where <dfn><code>&lt;level></code></dfn> is a <<number-token>> with its type flag set to "integer".

	The [=specificity=] of '':heading()'' is that of a class.

	<div class="example">
		The following example styles headings with levels between 1 and 3 with a
		font-weight of 900, while headings with levels 6 onward with font-weight of
		500, additionally heading levels 1 and 2 will be underlined, while 3 and
		beyond will have no text-decoration:

		<pre>:heading(1, 2, 3) { font-weight: 900; }</pre>
		<pre>:heading(6, 7, 8, 9) { font-weight: 500; }</pre>
		<pre>:heading(1, 2) { text-decoration: underline; }</pre>
		<pre>:heading(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) { text-decoration: none; }</pre>
	</div>

	Note: The <a>heading level</a> might be different from an element's
	<a>type selector</a>. Thus, a selector ''h1:heading(3)'' matches any
	''h1'' tag which has an exposed heading level of 3.

<h2 id="grid-structural-selectors" oldids="table-pseudos">
Grid-Structural Selectors</h2>

	The double-association of a cell in a 2D grid (to its row and column)
	cannot be represented by parentage in a hierarchical markup language.
	Only one of those associations can be represented hierarchically: the
	other must be explicitly or implicitly defined in the document language
	semantics. In both HTML and DocBook, two of the most common hierarchical
	markup languages, the markup is row-primary (that is, the row associations
	are represented hierarchically); the columns must be implied.
	To be able to represent such implied column-based relationships, the
	<a>column combinator</a> and the
	'':nth-col()'' and '':nth-last-col()'' pseudo-classes
	are defined.
	In a column-primary format, these pseudo-classes match against row associations instead.

<h3 id="the-column-combinator">
Column combinator (<code>||</code>)</h3>

	The <dfn export>column combinator</dfn>, which consists of two pipes (<dfn selector id="selectordef-column">||</dfn>)
	represents the relationship of a column element
	to a cell element belonging to the column it represents.
	Column membership is determined based on the semantics of the document language only:
	whether and how the elements are presented is not considered.
	If a cell element belongs to more than one column,
	it is represented by a selector indicating membership in any of those columns.

	<div class="example">
		The following example makes cells C, E, and G gray.

		<pre>
		col.selected || td {
			background: gray;
			color: white;
			font-weight: bold;
		}
		</pre>

		<pre>
		&lt;table>
			&lt;col span="2">
			&lt;col class="selected">
			&lt;tr>&lt;td>A &lt;td>B &lt;td>C
			&lt;tr>&lt;td colspan="2">D &lt;td>E
			&lt;tr>&lt;td>F &lt;td colspan="2">G
		&lt;/table>
		</pre>
	</div>

<h3 id="the-nth-col-pseudo">
'':nth-col()'' pseudo-class</h3>

	The <dfn id='nth-col-pseudo' lt=":nth-col()">:nth-col(<var>An+B</var>)</dfn>
	pseudo-class notation represents a cell element belonging to a column
	that has <var>An+B</var>-1 columns
	<strong>before</strong> it, for any positive
	integer or zero value of <code>n</code>. Column membership is determined
	based on the semantics of the document language only: whether and how the
	elements are presented is not considered. If a cell element belongs to
	more than one column, it is represented by a selector indicating any of
	those columns.

	The CSS Syntax Module [[!CSS3SYN]] defines the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-syntax/#anb"><var>An+B</var> notation</a>.

<h3 id="the-nth-last-col-pseudo">
'':nth-last-col()'' pseudo-class</h3>

	The <dfn id='nth-last-col-pseudo' lt=":nth-last-col()">:nth-last-col(<var>An+B</var>)</dfn>
	pseudo-class notation represents a cell element belonging to a column
	that has <var>An+B</var>-1 columns
	<strong>after</strong> it, for any positive
	integer or zero value of <code>n</code>. Column membership is determined
	based on the semantics of the document language only: whether and how the
	elements are presented is not considered. If a cell element belongs to
	more than one column, it is represented by a selector indicating any of
	those columns.

	The CSS Syntax Module [[!CSS3SYN]] defines the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-syntax/#anb"><var>An+B</var> notation</a>.

<h2 id="combinators">
Combinators</h2>

<h3 id="idref-combinators">
Reference combinators <code>/ref/</code></h3>

	The <dfn export>reference combinator</dfn> consists of two slashes
	with an intervening <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-namespace/#css-qnames">CSS qualified name</a>,
	and separates two <a>compound selectors</a>,
	e.g. ''A /attr/ B''.
	The element represented by the first <a>compound selector</a>
	explicitly references
	the element represented by the second <a>compound selector</a>.
	Unless the host language defines a different syntax for expressing this relationship,
	this relationship is considered to exist if
	the value of the specified attribute on the first element is an IDREF or an <a>ID selector</a>
	referencing the second element.

	Attribute matching for reference combinators follow the same rules as for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#attribute-selectors">attribute selectors</a>.

	<div class="example">
		The following example highlights an <a element>input</a> element
		when its <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.9"><code>&lt;label></code></a>
		is focused or hovered-over:

		<pre>
		label:is(:hover, :focus) /for/ input,       /* association by "for" attribute */
		label:is(:hover, :focus):not([for]) input { /* association by containment */
			box-shadow: yellow 0 0 10px;
		}
		</pre>
