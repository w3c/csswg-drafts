# Introduction # {#intro}

	This specification defines mechanisms for
	driving the progress of an animation
	based on the scroll progress of a scroll container.
	These <dfn export>scroll-driven animations</dfn>
	use a timeline based on scroll position,
	rather than one based on clock time.
	This module provides both an imperative API building on the Web Animations API
	as well as a declarative API building on CSS Animations.
	<!-- [[!CSS-ANIMATIONS-2]] bikeshed chokes on this -->
	[[!WEB-ANIMATIONS-1]]

	There are two types of <dfn export>scroll-driven timelines</dfn>:
	* [[#scroll-timelines|Scroll Progress Timelines]],
		which are linked to the scroll progress of a particular [=scroll container=]
	* [[#view-timelines|View Progress Timelines]],
		which are linked to the view progress of a particular [=box=] through a [=scrollport=]

	Note: Scroll-<em>driven</em> animations,
	whose progress is linked to the scroll position,
	are distinct from scroll-<em>triggered</em> animations,
	which are triggered by a scroll position,
	but whose progress is driven by time.

## Relationship to other specifications ## {#other-specs}

	Web Animations [[WEB-ANIMATIONS-1]] defines
	an abstract conceptual model for animations on the Web platform,
	with elements of the model including [=animations=] and their [=timelines=],
	and associated programming interfaces.
	This specification extends the Web Animations model
	by defining [=scroll-driven timelines=]
	and allowing them to drive progress in [=animations=]
	to create [=scroll-driven animations=].

	This specification introduces both
	programming interfaces for interacting with these concepts,
	as well as CSS properties that apply these concepts
	to CSS Animations [[CSS-ANIMATIONS-1]].
	To the extent the behavior of these CSS properties is described
	in terms of the programming interfaces,
	[=User Agents=] that do not support scripting
	may still conform to this specification
	by implementing the CSS features to behave
	as if the underlying programming interfaces were in place.

	Like most operations in CSS besides [=selector=] matching,
	features in this specification operate over
	the [=flattened element tree=].

## Relationship to asynchronous scrolling ## {#async-scrolling}

	Some user agents support scrolling that is asynchronous
	with respect to layout or script.
	This specification is intended to be compatible with such an architecture.

	Specifically, this specification allows expressing scroll-driven effects
	in a way that does not require script to run each time the effect is sampled.
	User agents that support asynchronous scrolling are allowed (but not required)
	to sample such effects asynchronously as well.

## Value Definitions ## {#values}

	This specification follows the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a>
	from [[!CSS2]]
	using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs">value definition syntax</a>
	from [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Value types not defined in this specification
	are defined in CSS Values &amp; Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification
	also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> as their property value.
	For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

# Scroll Progress Timelines # {#scroll-timelines}

	<dfn export>Scroll progress timelines</dfn>
	are timelines linked to progress
	in the scroll position of a [=scroll container=]
	along a particular axis.
	The startmost scroll position represents 0% progress
	and the endmost scroll position represents 100% progress.

	[=Scroll progress timelines=] can be referenced in 'animation-timeline'
	anonymously using the ''scroll()'' [=functional notation=]
	or by name (see [[#timeline-scope]])
	after declaring them using the 'scroll-timeline' properties.
	In the Web Animations API,
	they can be represented anonymously by a {{ScrollTimeline}} object.

## Calculating Progress for a Scroll Progress Timeline ## {#scroll-timeline-progress}

	Progress (the [=timeline/current time=]) for a [=scroll progress timeline=]
	is calculated as:
	<var>[=scroll offset=]</var> &div;
	(<var>[=scrollable overflow=] size</var> &minus;
		<var>[=scroll container=] size</var>)

	If the 0% position and 100% position coincide
	(i.e. the denominator in the [=timeline/current time=] formula is zero),
	the timeline is [=inactive timeline|inactive=].

## Anonymous Scroll Progress Timelines ## {#scroll-timelines-anonymous}

### The ''scroll()'' notation ### {#scroll-notation}

	The <dfn>scroll()</dfn> functional notation
	can be used as a <<single-animation-timeline>> value in 'animation-timeline'
	and specifies a [=scroll progress timeline=].
	Its syntax is

	<pre class="prod">
		<<scroll()>> = scroll( [ <<scroller>> || <<axis>> ]? )
		<dfn noexport><<axis>></dfn> = block | inline | vertical | horizontal
		<dfn noexport><<scroller>></dfn> = root | nearest | self
	</pre>

	By default,
	''scroll()'' references the [=block axis=] of the nearest ancestor [=scroll container=].
	Its arguments modify this lookup as follows:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="scroll(),scroll-timeline-axis,view-timeline-axis">
		<dt><dfn>block</dfn>
		<dd>
			Specifies to use the measure of progress along the
			[=block axis=] of the [=scroll container=].
			(Default.)

		<dt><dfn>inline</dfn>
		<dd>
			Specifies to use the measure of progress along the
			[=inline axis=] of the [=scroll container=].

		<dt><dfn>vertical</dfn>
		<dd>
			Specifies to use the measure of progress along the
			[=vertical axis=] of the [=scroll container=].

		<dt><dfn>horizontal</dfn>
		<dd>
			Specifies to use the measure of progress along the
			[=horizontal axis=] of the [=scroll container=].

		<dt><dfn>nearest</dfn>
		<dd>
			Specifies to use the nearest ancestor [=scroll container=].
			(Default.)

		<dt><dfn>root</dfn>
		<dd>
			Specifies to use the document viewport as the [=scroll container=].

		<dt><dfn>self</dfn>
		<dd>
			Specifies to use the element’s own [=principal box=] as the [=scroll container=].
			If the [=principal box=] is not a [=scroll container=],
			then the [=scroll progress timeline=] is [=inactive timeline|inactive=].
	</dl>

	Each use of ''scroll()'' corresponds to its own instance of {{ScrollTimeline}}
	in the Web Animations API,
	even if multiple elements use ''scroll()'' to refer
	to the same [=scroll container=] with the same arguments.

### The {{ScrollTimeline}} Interface ### {#scrolltimeline-interface}

	<pre class="idl">
		enum ScrollAxis {
		  "block",
		  "inline",
		  "horizontal",
		  "vertical"
		};

		dictionary ScrollTimelineOptions {
		  Element? source;
		  ScrollAxis axis = "block";
		};

		[Exposed=Window]
		interface ScrollTimeline : AnimationTimeline {
		  constructor(optional ScrollTimelineOptions options = {});
		  readonly attribute Element? source;
		  readonly attribute ScrollAxis axis;
		};
	</pre>

	A {{ScrollTimeline}} is an {{AnimationTimeline}}
	that represents a [=scroll progress timeline=].
	It can be passed to
	the {{Animation}} constructor or the {{Animatable/animate()}} method
	to link the animation to a [=scroll progress timeline=].

	<dl class="attributes" dfn-type=attribute dfn-for=ScrollTimeline>
		:   <dfn>source</dfn>
		::  The [=scroll container=] element
			whose scroll position drives the progress of the timeline.

		:   <dfn>axis</dfn>
		::  The axis of scrolling
			that drives the progress of the timeline.
			See value definitions for <<axis>>, above.
	</dl>

	Inherited attributes:
	<dl>
		:   {{AnimationTimeline/currentTime}} (inherited from {{AnimationTimeline}})
		::  Represents the scroll progress of the [=scroll container=]
			as a percentage CSSUnitValue,
			with 0% representing its startmost scroll position
			(in the [=writing mode=] of the [=scroll container=]).
			Null when the timeline is [=inactive timeline|inactive=].
	</dl>

	ISSUE: While 0% will usually represent the [=scroll container=]’s initial scroll position,
	it might not depending on its [=content distribution=].
	See [[css-align-3#overflow-scroll-position]].
	Is this what we want?
	<!-- turn this into a note instead of a question once resolved -->

	ISSUE: Add a note about whether {{AnimationTimeline/currentTime}}
	can be negative or > 100%.

	<dl class="constructors">
		:   <dfn constructor for=ScrollTimeline lt="ScrollTimeline(options)">ScrollTimeline(options)</dfn>
		::  Creates a new {{ScrollTimeline}} object using the following procedure:

			1.  Let |timeline| be the new {{ScrollTimeline}} object.

			1.  Set the {{ScrollTimeline/source}} of |timeline| to:

				<dl class="switch">
					:   If the `source` member of |options| is present and not null,
					::  The `source` member of |options|.

					:   Otherwise,
					::  The {{Document/scrollingElement}}
						of the {{Document}} <a lt="document	associated with a window">associated</a>
						with the {{Window}} that is the <a>current global object</a>.
				</dl>

			1.  Set the {{ScrollTimeline/axis}} property of |timeline|
				to the corresponding value from |options|.
	</dl>

	If the {{ScrollTimeline/source}} of a {{ScrollTimeline}}
	is an element whose [=principal box=] does not exist
	or is not a [=scroll container=],
	or if there is no [=scrollable overflow=],
	then the {{ScrollTimeline}} is [=inactive timeline|inactive=].

	A {{ScrollTimeline}}’s {{AnimationTimeline/duration}} is 100%.

	The values of {{ScrollTimeline/source}} and {{AnimationTimeline/currentTime}}
	are both computed when either is requested or updated.

## Named Scroll Progress Timelines ## {#scroll-timelines-named}

	[=Scroll progress timelines=] can also be defined on the [=scroll container=] itself,
	and then referenced by name.
	See [[#timeline-scope]].

	Named scroll progress timelines are declared in the [=coordinated value list=]
	constructed from the [=longhands=] of the 'scroll-timeline' [=shorthand property=],
	which form a [=coordinating list property group=]
	with 'scroll-timeline-name' as the [=coordinating list base property=].
	See [[css-values-4#linked-properties]].

### Naming a Scroll Progress Timeline: the 'scroll-timeline-name' property ### {#scroll-timeline-name}

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: scroll-timeline-name
	Value: none | <<custom-ident>>#
	Initial: none
	Applies to: [=scroll containers=]
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: the keyword ''scroll-timeline-name/none'' or a list of <<custom-ident>>s
	Animation type: not animatable
	</pre>

	Specifies names for the [=scroll progress timelines=]
	associated with this [=scroll container=].
	The axis for this timeline is given by 'scroll-timeline-axis'.

### Axis of a Scroll Progress Timeline: the 'scroll-timeline-axis' property ### {#scroll-timeline-axis}

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: scroll-timeline-axis
	Value: [ block | inline | vertical | horizontal ]#
	Initial: block
	Applies to: [=scroll containers=]
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: a list of the keywords specified
	Animation type: not animatable
	</pre>

	Specifies an axis for each [=scroll progress timeline=]
	associated with this [=scroll container=].
	The name for this timeline is given by 'scroll-timeline-name'.

	Values are as defined for ''scroll()''.

	Note: This property has no effect on [=scroll progress timelines=]
	that are declared on this element
	but whose [=attachment=] is ''scroll-timeline-attachment/defer''.

### Attachment of a Scroll Progress Timeline: the 'scroll-timeline-attachment' property ### {#scroll-timeline-attachment}

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: scroll-timeline-attachment
	Value: [ local | defer | ancestor ]#
	Initial: local
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: a list of the keywords specified
	Animation type: not animatable
	</pre>

	Specifies attachment behavior for each [=scroll progress timeline=]
	associated with this element.

	A scroll timeline has a <dfn>attachment</dfn>,
	that determines which [=scroll container=] and {{ScrollTimeline/axis}} to use
	when calculating the [progress of the timeline](#scroll-timeline-progress).

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=scroll-timeline-attachment>
		<dt><dfn>local</dfn>
		<dd>
			The [=attachment=] is this timeline.

		<dt><dfn>defer</dfn>
		<dd>
			The [=attachment=] is the timeline among the flat-tree descendants
			that satisfies all of the following:
			* The timeline has a matching 'scroll-timeline-name'.
			* The timeline has [=ancestor=] attachment.
			* There is no intermediate ''scroll-timeline-attachment/defer'' timeline
				declared with the same name.

			If more than one such candidate exists,
			then this timeline has no [=attachment=].

		<dt><dfn>ancestor</dfn>
		<dd>
			The timeline has no [=attachment=].

			Timelines with [=ancestor=] attachment are treated as nameless
			for the purposes of timeline lookup;
			they can't be referenced by 'animation-timeline'.
	</dl>

	Timelines that have no [=attachment=] are [=inactive timeline|inactive=].

	<div class=example>
		Using ''scroll-timeline-attachment: defer'',
		an element can effectively refer to timelines
		that appear <em>after it</em> in tree order.
		For example, the following creates an animation on <code>#target</code> that
		is ultimately linked to a scroll timeline defined on the subsequent sibling.

		<pre class=lang-css>
		@keyframes anim {
		  from { color: red; }
		  to { color: green; }
		}

		#root {
		  scroll-timeline-name: mytimeline;
		  scroll-timeline-attachment: defer;
		}

		#root #target {
		  animation: anim;
		  animation-timeline: mytimeline;
		}

		#root #target + #scroller {
		  scroll-timeline-name: mytimeline;
		  scroll-timeline-attachment: ancestor;
		}
		</pre>
	</div>

### Scroll Timeline Shorthand: the 'scroll-timeline' shorthand ### {#scroll-timeline-shorthand}

	<pre class='propdef shorthand'>
	Name: scroll-timeline
	Value: [ <<'scroll-timeline-name'>> [ <<'scroll-timeline-axis'>> || <<'scroll-timeline-attachment'>> ]? ]#
	Applies to: [=scroll containers=]
	Inherited: no
	Animation type: not animatable
	</pre>

	This property is a [=shorthand=] for setting
	'scroll-timeline-name', 'scroll-timeline-axis', and 'scroll-timeline-attachment'
	in a single declaration.

# View Progress Timelines # {#view-timelines}

	Often animations are desired to start and end
	during the portion of the [=scroll progress timeline=]
	that a particular element
	(the <dfn>view progress subject</dfn> element)
	is in view within the [=scrollport=].
	<dfn export>View progress timelines</dfn>
	are segments of a [=scroll progress timeline=]
	that are scoped to the scroll positions
	in which any part of the associated element’s [=principal box=]
	intersects its nearest ancestor [=scrollport=]
	(or more precisely, the relevant [=view progress visibility range=]
	of that [=scrollport=]).
	The startmost such scroll position represents 0% progress
	and the endmost such scroll position represents 100% progress,
	see [[#view-timeline-progress]].

	Note: The 0% and 100% scroll positions are not always reachable,
	e.g. if the box is positioned
	at the start edge of the [=scrollable overflow rectangle=],
	it might not be possible to scroll to < 32% progress.

	[=View progress timelines=] can be referenced
	anonymously using the ''view()'' [=functional notation=]
	or by name (see [[#timeline-scope]])
	after declaring them using the 'view-timeline' properties
	on the [=view progress subject=].
	In the Web Animations API,
	they can be represented anonymously by a {{ViewTimeline}} object.

## View Progress Timeline Ranges ## {#view-timelines-ranges}

	[=View progress timelines=] define the following [=named timeline ranges=]:

	<dl dfn-for="animation-timeline-range" dfn-type="value">
		<dt><dfn>cover</dfn>
		<dd>
			Represents the full range of the [=view progress timeline=]:
			* 0% progress represents the position at which
				the [=start=] [=border edge=] of the element’s [=principal box=]
				coincides with the [=end=] edge of its [=view progress visibility range=].
			* 100% progress represents the position at which
				the [=end=] [=border edge=] of the element’s [=principal box=]
				coincides with the [=start=] edge of its [=view progress visibility range=].

		<dt><dfn>contain</dfn>
		<dd>
			Represents the range during which the [=principal box=]
			is either fully contained by, or fully covers,
			its [=view progress visibility range=] within the [=scrollport=].
			* 0% progress represents the earlier position at which:
				* the [=start=] [=border edge=] of the element’s [=principal box=]
					coincides with the [=start=] edge of its [=view progress visibility range=].
				* the [=end=] [=border edge=] of the element’s [=principal box=]
					coincides with the [=end=] edge of its [=view progress visibility range=].
			* 100% progress represents the later position at which:
				* the [=start=] [=border edge=] of the element’s [=principal box=]
					coincides with the [=start=] edge of its [=view progress visibility range=].
				* the [=end=] [=border edge=] of the element’s [=principal box=]
					coincides with the [=end=] edge of its [=view progress visibility range=].

		<dt><dfn>entry</dfn>
		<dd>
			Represents the range during which the [=principal box=]
			is entering the [=view progress visibility range=].
			* 0% is equivalent to 0% of the ''animation-timeline-range/cover'' range.
			* 100% is equivalent to 0% of the ''animation-timeline-range/contain'' range.

		<dt><dfn>exit</dfn>
		<dd>
			Represents the range during which the [=principal box=]
			is exiting the [=view progress visibility range=].
			* 0% is equivalent to 100% of the ''animation-timeline-range/contain'' range.
			* 100% is equivalent to 100% of the ''animation-timeline-range/cover'' range.

		<dt><dfn>entry-crossing</dfn>
		<dd>
			Represents the range during which the [=principal box=] crosses the [=end=]
			[=border edge=]
			* 0% progress represents the position at which
				the [=start=] [=border edge=] of the element’s [=principal box=]
				coincides with the [=end=] edge of its [=view progress visibility range=].
			* 100% progress represents the position at which
				the [=end=] [=border edge=] of the element’s [=principal box=]
				coincides with the [=end=] edge of its [=view progress visibility range=].

		<dt><dfn>exit-crossing</dfn>
		<dd>
			Represents the range during which the [=principal box=] crosses the [=start=]
			[=border edge=]
			* 0% progress represents the position at which
				the [=start=] [=border edge=] of the element’s [=principal box=]
				coincides with the [=start=] edge of its [=view progress visibility range=].
			* 100% progress represents the position at which
				the [=end=] [=border edge=] of the element’s [=principal box=]
				coincides with the [=start=] edge of its [=view progress visibility range=].
	</dl>

	ISSUE: Insert diagrams.

	In all cases, the [=writing mode=] used to resolve the [=start=] and [=end=] sides
	is the [=writing mode=] of the relevant [=scroll container=].
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms/">Transforms</a> are ignored,
	but [=relative positioning|relative=] and [=absolute positioning|absolute=] positioning
	are accounted for.
	For [=sticky-positioned boxes=],
	the box’s [=startmost=] offset position
	is used when identifying 0% progress,
	and the box’s [=endmost=] offset position
	is used when identifying 100% progress.
	[[CSS-POSITION-3]] [[CSS-TRANSFORMS-1]]

## Calculating Progress for a View Progress Timeline ## {#view-timeline-progress}

	Progress (the [=timeline/current time=]) in a [=view progress timeline=]
	is calculated as:
	|distance| &div; |range|
	where:
	* |distance| is the current [=scroll offset=]
		minus the [=scroll offset=] corresponding to
		the start of the ''animation-timeline-range/cover'' range
	* |range| is
		the [=scroll offset=] corresponding to
		the start of the ''animation-timeline-range/cover'' range
		minus
		the [=scroll offset=] corresponding to
		the end of the ''animation-timeline-range/cover'' range

	If the 0% position and 100% position coincide
	(i.e. the denominator in the [=timeline/current time=] formula is zero),
	the timeline is [=inactive timeline|inactive=].

## Anonymous View Progress Timelines ## {#view-timelines-anonymous}

### The ''view()'' notation ### {#view-notation}

	The <dfn>view()</dfn> functional notation
	can be used as a <<single-animation-timeline>> value in 'animation-timeline'
	and specifies a [=view progress timeline=]
	in reference to the nearest ancestor [=scroll container=].
	Its syntax is

	<pre class="prod">
		<<view()>> = view( [ <<axis>> || <<'view-timeline-inset'>> ]? )
	</pre>

	By default,
	''view()'' references the [=block axis=];
	as for ''scroll()'',
	this can be changed by providing an explicit <<axis>> value.

	The optional <<'view-timeline-inset'>> value provides an adjustment
	of the [=view progress visibility range=],
	as defined for 'view-timeline-inset'.

	Each use of ''view()'' corresponds to its own instance of {{ViewTimeline}}
	in the Web Animations API,
	even if multiple elements use ''view()'' to reference
	the same element with the same arguments.

### The {{ViewTimeline}} Interface ### {#viewtimeline-interface}

	<pre class="idl">
		dictionary ViewTimelineOptions {
		  Element subject;
		  ScrollAxis axis = "block";
		};

		[Exposed=Window]
		interface ViewTimeline : ScrollTimeline {
		  constructor(optional ViewTimelineOptions options = {});
		  readonly attribute Element subject;
		  readonly attribute CSSNumericValue startOffset;
		  readonly attribute CSSNumericValue endOffset;
		};
	</pre>

	A {{ViewTimeline}} is an {{AnimationTimeline}}
	that specifies a [=view progress timeline=].
	It can be passed to
	the {{Animation}} constructor or the {{Animatable/animate()}} method
	to link the animation to a [=view progress timeline=].

	<dl class="attributes" dfn-type=attribute dfn-for=ViewTimeline>
		:   <dfn>subject</dfn>
		::  The element whose [=principal box=]’s visibility in the [=scrollport=]
			defines the progress of the timeline.

		:   <dfn>startOffset</dfn>
		::  Represents the starting (0% progress) scroll position
			of the [=view progress timeline=]
			as a length offset (in ''px'') from the [=scroll origin=].
			Null when the timeline is [=inactive timeline|inactive=].

		:   <dfn>endOffset</dfn>
		::  Represents the ending (100% progress) scroll position
			of the [=view progress timeline=]
			as a length offset (in ''px'') from the [=scroll origin=].
			Null when the timeline is [=inactive timeline|inactive=].
	</dl>

	Note: The values of {{ViewTimeline/startOffset}} and {{ViewTimeline/endOffset}}
	are relative to the [=scroll origin=], not the [=physical=] top left corner.
	Depending on the [=writing mode=] of the [=scroll container=],
	they therefore might not match {{Element/scrollLeft}} or {{Element/scrollTop}} values,
	for example in the [=horizontal axis=] in a right-to-left (''rtl'') [=writing mode=].

	Inherited attributes:

	<dl>
		:   {{ScrollTimeline/source}} (inherited from {{ScrollTimeline}})
		::  The nearest ancestor of the {{ViewTimeline/subject}}
			whose [=principal box=] establishes a [=scroll container=],
			whose scroll position drives the progress of the timeline.

		:   {{ScrollTimeline/axis}} (inherited from {{ScrollTimeline}})
		::  Specifies the axis of scrolling
			that drives the progress of the timeline.
			See <<axis>>, above.

		:   {{AnimationTimeline/currentTime}} (inherited from {{AnimationTimeline}})
		::  Represents the current progress
			of the [=view progress timeline=]
			as a percentage {{CSSUnitValue}}
			representing its [=scroll container=]’s scroll progress at that position.
			Null when the timeline is [=inactive timeline|inactive=].
	</dl>

	<dl class="constructors">
		:   <dfn constructor for=ViewTimeline lt="ViewTimeline(options)">ViewTimeline(options)</dfn>
		::  Creates a new {{ViewTimeline}} object using the following procedure:

			1.  Let |timeline| be the new {{ViewTimeline}} object.

			1.  Set the {{ViewTimeline/subject}} and {{ScrollTimeline/axis}} properties of |timeline|
				to the corresponding values from |options|.

			1. Set the {{ScrollTimeline/source}} of |timeline|
				to the {{ViewTimeline/subject}}’s
				nearest ancestor [=scroll container=] element.
	</dl>

	If the {{ScrollTimeline/source}} or {{ViewTimeline/subject}} of a {{ViewTimeline}}
	is an element whose [=principal box=] does not exist,
	or if its nearest ancestor [=scroll container=] has no [=scrollable overflow=],
	then the {{ViewTimeline}} is [=inactive timeline|inactive=].

	ISSUE: Figure out how to incorporate fit/inset abilities.

	The values of {{ViewTimeline/subject}}, {{ScrollTimeline/source}}, and {{AnimationTimeline/currentTime}}
	are all computed when any of them is requested or updated.

## Named View Progress Timelines ## {#view-timelines-named}

	[=View progress timelines=] can also be defined declaratively
	and then referenced by name.
	See [[#timeline-scope]].

	Named view progress timelines are declared in the [=coordinated value list=]
	constructed from the 'view-timeline-*' properties,
	which form a [=coordinating list property group=]
	with 'view-timeline-name' as the [=coordinating list base property=].
	See [[css-values-4#linked-properties]].

### Naming a View Progress Timeline: the 'view-timeline-name' property ### {#view-timeline-name}

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: view-timeline-name
	Value: none | <<custom-ident>>#
	Initial: none
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: the keyword ''view-timeline-name/none'' or a list of <<custom-ident>>s
	Animation type: not animatable
	</pre>

	Specifies names for any [=view progress timelines=]
	associated with this element’s [=principal box=].

### Axis of a View Progress Timeline: the 'view-timeline-axis' property ### {#view-timeline-axis}

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: view-timeline-axis
	Value: [ block | inline | vertical | horizontal ]#
	Initial: block
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: a list of the keywords specified
	Animation type: not animatable
	</pre>

	Specifies an axis for each named [=view progress timeline=]
	associated with this [=scroll container=].

	Note: This property has no effect on [=scroll progress timelines=]
	that are declared on this element
	but whose [=attachment=] is ''view-timeline-attachment/defer''.

### Inset of a View Progress Timeline: the 'view-timeline-inset' property ### {#view-timeline-inset}

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: view-timeline-inset
	Value: [ [ auto | <<length-percentage>> ]{1,2} ]#
	Initial: auto
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: relative to the corresponding dimension of the relevant scrollport
	Computed value: a list consisting of two-value pairs representing the start and end insets each as either the keyword ''view-timeline-inset/auto'' or a computed <<length-percentage>> value
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	Specifies an inset (positive) or outset (negative) adjustment of the [=scrollport=]
	when determining whether the box is in view
	when setting the bounds of the corresponding [=view progress timeline=].
	The first value represents the [=start=] inset in the relevant axis;
	the second value represents the [=end=] inset.
	If the second value is omitted, it is set to the first.
	The resulting range of the [=scrollport=] is
	the <dfn>view progress visibility range</dfn>.

	<dl dfn-for=view-timeline-inset dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates to use the value of 'scroll-padding'.

		<dt><dfn><<length-percentage>></dfn>
		<dd>
			Like 'scroll-padding',
			defines an inward offset from the corresponding edge of the scrollport.
	</dl>

	Note: This property has no effect on [=scroll progress timelines=]
	that are declared on this element
	but whose [=attachment=] is ''view-timeline-attachment/defer''.

### Attachment of a View Progress Timeline: the 'view-timeline-attachment' property ### {#view-timeline-attachment}

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: view-timeline-attachment
	Value: <'view-timeline-attachment'>#
	Initial: local
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: a list of the keywords specified
	Animation type: not animatable
	</pre>

	Specifies attachment behavior for each [=view progress timeline=]
	associated with this element.
	Values and behavior are as for 'view-timeline-attachment',
	except that the [=attachment=] also determines
	the <a property lt="view-timeline-inset">inset</a> and {{ViewTimeline/subject}}
	of the [=view progress timeline=].

### View Timeline Shorthand: the 'view-timeline' shorthand ### {#view-timeline-shorthand}

	<pre class='propdef shorthand'>
	Name: view-timeline
	Value: [ <<'view-timeline-name'>> [ <<'view-timeline-axis'>> || <<'view-timeline-attachment'>> ]? ]#
	Applies to: all elements
	</pre>

	This property is a [=shorthand=] for setting
	'view-timeline-name', 'view-timeline-axis', and 'view-timeline-attachment'
	in a single declaration.
	It does not set 'view-timeline-inset'.

	ISSUE: Should it reset 'view-timeline-inset' also?

# Attaching Animations to [=Scroll-driven Timelines=] # {#scroll-driven-attachment}

	Animations can be attached to [=scroll-driven timelines=]
	using the 'scroll-timeline' property (in CSS)
	or the {{AnimationTimeline}} parameters (in the Web Animations API).
	The timeline range to which their [=active interval=] is attached
	can also be further restricted to a particular timeline range
	(see [[#named-range-animation-declaration]]).

	Time-based delays ('animation-delay')
	do not apply to [=scroll-driven animations=],
	which are distance-based.

## Finite Timeline Calculations ## {#finite-attachment}

	Unlike time-driven timelines,
	[=scroll-driven timelines=] are finite,
	thus [=scroll-driven animations=] are always attached
	to a finite [=attachment range=]--
	which may be further limited by 'animation-range'
	(see [[#timeline-ranges]]).
	The animation’s <!-- delays ('animation-delay')
	and --> iterations ('animation-iteration-count')
	are set within the limits of this finite range.
	If the specified duration is ''animation-duration/auto'',
	then <!-- once any delays are subtracted, -->
	the remaining range is divided by its [=iteration count=] ('animation-iteration-count')
	to find the [=used value|used=] duration.

	Note: If the animation has an infinite [=iteration count=],
	each [=iteration duration=]--
	and the resulting [=active duration=]--
	will be zero.

	Animations that include absolutely-positioned keyframes
	(those pinned to a specific point on the timeline,
	e.g. using [[#named-range-keyframes|named timeline range keyframe selectors]] in ''@keyframes'')
	are assumed to have an [=iteration count=] of 1
	for the purpose of finding those keyframes’ positions
	relative to 0% and 100%;
	the entire animation is then scaled to fit the [=iteration duration=]
	and repeated for each iteration.

	Note: It's unclear what the use case might be
	for combining absolutely-positioned keyframes
	with iteration counts above 1;
	this at least gives a defined behavior.
	(An alternative, but perhaps weirder, behavior
	would be to take such absolutely-positioned keyframes
	“out of flow” while iterating the remaining keyframes.)
	The editors would be interested in hearing about
	any real use cases for multiple iterations here.

## Named Timeline Scoping ## {#timeline-scope}

	A named [=scroll progress timeline=] or [=view progress timeline=]
	is referenceable in 'animation-timeline' by:
	* the declaring element itself
	* that element’s descendants

	If multiple elements have declared the same timeline name,
	the matching timeline is the one declared
	on the nearest element in tree order.
	In case of a name conflict on the same element,
	[=scroll progress timelines=] take precedence over [=view progress timelines=].

	Note: Using deferred [=attachment=] effectively allow scoping beyond this.

## Animation Events ## {#events}

	[=Scroll-driven animations=] dispatch all the same animation events
	as the more typical time-driven animations
	as described in
	[[web-animations-1#animation-events-section]],
	[[css-animations-1#events]],
	and [[css-animations-2#event-dispatch]].

	Note: When scrolling backwards,
	the <code>animationstart</code> event will fire
	at the <em>end</em> of the [=active interval=],
	and the <code>animationend</code> event will fire
	at the start of the [=active interval=].
	However, since the <code>finish</code> event
	is about entering the [=finished play state=],
	it only fires when scrolling forwards.

# Frame Calculation Details # {#frames}

## HTML Processing Model: Event loop

	The ability for scrolling to drive the progress of an animation,
	gives rise to the possibility of <dfn>layout cycles</dfn>,
	where a change to a scroll offset causes an animation's effect to update,
	which in turn causes a new change to the scroll offset.

	To avoid such [=layout cycles=],
	animations with a [=scroll progress timeline=] update their current time once
	during step 7.10 of the [HTML Processing Model](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#processing-model-8) event loop,
	as step 1 of [=update animations and send events=].

	During step 7.14.1 of the [HTML Processing Model](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#processing-model-8),
	any created [=scroll progress timelines=] or [=view progress timelines=] are collected into an <dfn export>initially stale</dfn> set.
	After step 7.14.1 if there are any [=initially stale=] timelines, they update their current time,
	the set of [=initially stale=] timelines is cleared and
	we run and we run an additional step to recalculate styles and update layout.
	As we only gather stale timelines during the first style and layout calculation,
	this can only directly cause one additional style recalculation.

	Note: Without this additional round of style and layout,
	[=initially stale=] timelines would remain stale
	(i.e. they would not have a current time)
	for the remainder of the frame where the timeline was created.
	This means that animations linked to such a timeline
	would not produce any [=effect value=] for that frame,
	which could lead to an undesirable initial "flash"
	in the rendered output.

	Note: This section has no effect on forced style and layout
	calculations triggered by {{Window/getComputedStyle()|getComputedStyle()}} or similar.
	In other words, [=initially stale=] timelines are visible as such
	through those APIs.

	If the step 7.14 of the [HTML Processing Model](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#processing-model-8)
	would result in a change of time for any [=scroll progress timelines=] or
	[=view progress timelines=], they will not be re-sampled to reflect the
	new offset until the next update of the rendering.

	Nothing in this section is intended to require
	that scrolling block on layout or script.
	If a user agent normally composites frames where scrolling has occurred
	but the consequences of scrolling have not been fully propagated in layout or script
	(for example, `scroll` event listeners have not yet run),
	the user agent may likewise choose not to sample scroll-driven animations
	for that composited frame.
	In such cases, the rendered scroll offset
	and the state of a scroll-driven animation
	may be inconsistent in the composited frame.

# Appendix A: Timeline Ranges # {#timeline-ranges}

	ISSUE: This section should move to CSS-ANIMATIONS-2 and WEB-ANIMATIONS-2.

	This specification introduces the concepts of [=named timeline ranges=]
	and [=animation attachment ranges=]
	to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-animations/">CSS Animations</a>
	and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/">Web Animations</a>.

## Named Timeline Ranges ## {#named-ranges}

	A <dfn export>named timeline range</dfn>
	is a named segment of an animation [=timeline=].
	The start of the segment is represented as 0% progress through the range;
	the end of the segment is represented as 100% progress through the range.
	Multiple [=named timeline ranges=] can be associated with a given [=timeline=],
	and multiple such ranges can overlap.
	For example, the ''animation-timeline/contain'' range of a [=view progress timeline=]
	overlaps with its ''animation-timeline/cover'' range.
	[=Named timeline ranges=] are represented by
	the <dfn><<timeline-range-name>></dfn> value type,
	which indicates a [=CSS identifier=] representing
	one of the predefined [=named timeline ranges=].

	Note: In this specification, [=named timeline ranges=]
	must be defined to exist by a specification
	such as [[SCROLL-ANIMATIONS-1]].
	A future level may introduce APIs for authors to declare
	their own custom [=named timeline ranges=].

## Named Timeline Range Keyframe Selectors ## {#named-range-keyframes}

	[=Named timeline range=] names and percentages
	can be used to attach keyframes
	to specific progress points within the [=named timeline range=].
	The CSS ''@keyframes'' rule is extended thus:

	<pre class="prod">
		<<keyframe-selector>> = from | to | <<percentage [0,100]>> | <<timeline-range-name>> <<percentage>>
	</pre>

	where <<timeline-range-name>> is the [=CSS identifier=]
	that represents a chosen predefined [=named timeline range=],
	and the <<percentage>> after it represents the percentage progress
	between the start and end of that [=named timeline range=].

	Keyframes are attached to the specified point in the timeline.
	If the timeline does not have a corresponding [=named timeline range=],
	then any keyframes attached to points on that [=named timeline range=]
	are ignored.
	It is possible that these attachment points
	are outside the [=active interval=] of the animation;
	in these cases the automatic ''from'' (0%) and ''to'' (100%) keyframes
	are only generated for properties that don't have keyframes
	at or earlier than 0% or at or after 100% (respectively).

## Attaching Animations to Timeline Ranges ## {#named-range-animation-declaration}

	A set of animation keyframes can be attached
	in reference to an <dfn export local-lt="attachment range">animation attachment range</dfn>,
	restricting the animation’s [=active interval=] to that range of a timeline,
	with the 'animation-range' properties.
	Delays (see 'animation-delay')
	are set within this restricted range,
	further reducing the time available for ''animation-duration/auto'' durations
	and ''animation-iteration-count/infinite'' iterations.
	Any frames positioned outside the [=attachment range=]
	are used for interpolation as needed,
	but are outside the [=active interval=]
	and therefore dropped from the animation itself,
	effectively truncating the animation
	at the end of its [=attachment range=].

	<pre class="ascii-art">
	range start┐             ╺┉┉active interval┉┉╸           ┌range end
	┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄├─────────────╊━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╉───────────┤┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄
	           ╶┄start delay┄╴                   ╶┄end delay┄╴
	                         ╶┄┄┄┄┄ duration┄┄┄┄┄╴
	</pre>

	The 'animation-range' properties
	are [=reset-only sub-properties=] of the 'animation' [=shorthand=].

	ISSUE: Define application to time-driven animations.

### Specifying an Animation’s Timeline Range: the 'animation-range' shorthand ### {#animation-range}

	<pre class="propdef shorthand">
		Name: animation-range
		Value: [ <<'animation-range-start'>> <<'animation-range-end'>>? ]#
	</pre>

	The 'animation-range' property is a [=shorthand property|shorthand=]
	that sets 'animation-range-start' and 'animation-range-end'
	together in a single declaration,
	associating the animation with the specified [=animation attachment range=].

	If <<'animation-range-end'>> is omitted
	and <<'animation-range-start'>> includes a <<timeline-range-name>> component,
	then 'animation-range-end' is set to that same <<timeline-range-name>> and ''100%''.
	Otherwise, any omitted [=longhand=] is set to its [=initial value=].

	<div class="example">
		The following sets of declarations show an 'animation-range' [=shorthand=] declaration
		followed by its equivalent 'animation-range-start' and 'animation-range-end' declarations:
		<pre style="columns: 40ch">

			animation-range-start: entry 10%;
			animation-range-end: exit 90%;

### Specifying an Animation’s Timeline Range Start: the 'animation-range-start' property ### {#animation-range-start}

	<pre class="propdef">

		Computed value: list, each item either the keyword ''animation-range-start/normal'' or a timeline range and progress percentage
		Animation type: not animatable
	</pre>

	Specifies the start of the animations’s [=attachment range=],
	shifting the <a spec="web-animations-1">start time</a> of the animation
	(i.e. where keyframes mapped to 0% progress are attached
	when the iteration count is 1)
	accordingly.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for="animation-range-start" dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>normal</dfn>
		<dd>
			The start of the animation’s [=attachment range=]
			is the start of its associated [=timeline=];
			the start of the animation’s [=active interval=]
			is determined as normal.

		<dt><dfn><<length-percentage>></dfn>

	(i.e. where keyframes mapped to 100% progress are attached
	when the iteration count is 1)
	and/or truncating the animation’s [=active interval=].

## Reporting Timeline Range Progress: the ''getCurrentTime()'' method ## {#named-range-get-time}

	Progress through named ranges is exposed on the {{AnimationTimeline}} object
	by the {{AnimationTimeline/getCurrentTime()}} method:

		1. If [=this=] is an [=inactive timeline=],
			return null.

		1. If |rangeName| is provided:

			1. If |rangeName| is a valid [=named timeline range=] on [=this=],
				let |progress| be the current progress through that range,
				expressed as a percentage value.

				Create a [=new unit value=] from (|progress|, "percent")
				and return it.

				If the start and end points of the [=named timeline range=] coincide,
				return negative infinity for time values before it,
				positive infinity for time values after it,
				and zero for time values coinciding with that point.

			2. Otherwise, return null.

		2. Let |current time|
			be the value of [=this's=] {{AnimationTimeline/currentTime}} internal slot.

			If [=this=] is a {{ScrollTimeline}},
			create a [=new unit value=] from (|current time|, "percent")
			and return it.

			Otherwise,
			create a [=new unit value=] from (|current time|, "ms")
			and return it.
