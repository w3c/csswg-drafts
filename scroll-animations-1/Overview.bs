# Introduction # {#intro}

This specification defines mechanisms for
[[#scroll-driven-animations|driving the progress of an animation]] based
on the scroll progress of a scroll container.

## Relationship to other specifications ## {#other-specs}

Web Animations [[WEB-ANIMATIONS-1]] defines an abstract conceptual model for
animations on the Web platform, with elements of the model including
[=animations=] and their [=timelines=],
and associated programming interfaces.

This specification extends this model by defining a new type of animation [=timeline=]:
a [=scroll timeline=].

This specification defines both programming interfaces for interacting with these
concepts, as well as CSS markup which applies these concepts to CSS Animations
[[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]].

The behavior of the CSS markup is described in terms of the programming interfaces.
User agents that do not support script may still implement the CSS markup
provided it behaves as if the underlying programming interfaces were in place.

## Relationship to asynchronous scrolling ## {#async-scrolling}

Some user agents support scrolling that is asynchronous with respect to layout
or script. This specification is intended to be compatible with such an
architecture.

Specifically, this specification allows expressing scroll-linked effects in a
way that does not require script to run each time the effect is sampled. User
agents that support asynchronous scrolling are allowed (but not required) to
sample such effects asynchronously as well.

## Value Definitions ## {#values}

This specification follows the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]] using the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs">value definition
syntax</a> from [[!CSS-VALUES-3]]. Value types not defined in this specification
are defined in CSS Values &amp; Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]]. Combination with other
CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
all properties defined in this specification
also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> as their property value.
For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

# Use cases # {#use-cases}

<em>This section is non-normative</em>

Note: Based on this <a
href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/master/scroll-animations-1/Use%20cases.md">curated
list of use cases</a>.

Issue(4354): These use cases need updating.

## Scrollable picture-story show ## {#scrollable-animation-usecase}

It is sometimes desired to use an animation to tell a story where the user
controls the progress of the animation by scrolling or some other
gesture. This may be because the animation contains a lot of textual
information which the user may wish to peruse more slowly, it may be for
accessibility considerations to accommodate users who are uncomfortable
with rapid animation, or it may simply be to allow the user to easily
return to previous parts of the story such as a story that introduces
a product where the user wishes to review previous information.

The following (simplified) example shows two balls colliding. The
animation is controlled by scroll position allowing the user to easily
rewind and replay the interaction.

<figure>
<img src="img/usecase3-1.svg" width="600"
alt="Use case: The picture-story show.">
 <figcaption>
  A scrollable movie.<br>
  The left figure shows the initial position of the balls<br>
  The right figure shows them after they have collided.
 </figcaption>
</figure>

Using the CSS markup:

<pre class='lang-css'>
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  div.circle {
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-timing-function: linear;
    animation-timeline: collision-timeline;
  }
  #left-circle {
    animation-name: left-circle;
  }
  #right-circle {
    animation-name: right-circle;
  }
  #union-circle {
    animation-name: union-circle;
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
    animation-timeline: union-timeline;
  }

  @scroll-timeline collision-timeline {
    source: selector(#container);
    orientation: block;
    scroll-offsets: 200px, 300px;
  }

  @scroll-timeline union-timeline {
    source: selector(#container);
    orientation: block;
    scroll-offsets: 250px, 300px;
  }

  @keyframes left-circle {
    to { transform: translate(300px) }
  }
  @keyframes right-circle {
    to { transform: translate(350px) }
  }
  @keyframes union-circle {
    to { opacity: 1 }
  }
}
</pre>

Using the programming interface, we might write this as:

<pre class='lang-javascript'>
if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)').matches) {
  const scrollableElement = document.querySelector('#container');

  const collisionTimeline = new ScrollTimeline({
    source: scrollableElement,
    scrollOffsets: [CSS.px(200), CSS.px(300)]
  });

  const left = leftCircle.animate({ transform: 'translate(300px)' }, 1000);
  left.timeline = collisionTimeline;

  const right = leftCircle.animate({ transform: 'translate(350px)' }, 1000);
  right.timeline = collisionTimeline;

  const union = unionCircle.animate({ opacity: 1 }, { duration: 1000, fill: "forwards" });
  union.timeline = new ScrollTimeline({
    source: scrollableElement,
    scrollOffsets: [CSS.px(250), CSS.px(300)]
  });
}
</pre>

## The content progress bar ## {#content-progress-bar-usecase}

Another common example of an animation that tracks scroll position is a
progress bar that is used to indicate the reader's position in a long
article.

<figure>
<img src="img/usecase3-2.svg" width="600"
alt="Use case: Scroll based styling">
 <figcaption>
  Content progress bar.<br>
  The left figure shows the initial state before scrolling.<br>
  The right figure shows the progress bar is half-filled in since the
  user has scrolled half way through the article.
 </figcaption>
</figure>

Typically, the scroll bar provides this visual indication but
applications may wish to hide the scroll bar for aesthetic or useability
reasons.

Using the updated 'animation' shorthand that includes 'animation-timeline',
this example could be written as follows:

<pre class='lang-css'>
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @scroll-timeline progress-timeline {
    source: selector(#body);
    scroll-offsets: 0, 100%;
  }

  @keyframes progress {
    to { width: 100%; }
  }
  #progress {
    width: 0px;
    height: 30px;
    background: red;
    animation: 1s linear forwards progress progress-timeline;
  }
}
</pre>


If we use this API for this case, the example code will be as follow:

<pre class='lang-javascript'>
if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)').matches) {
  var animation = div.animate({ width: '100%' }, { duration: 1000, fill: "forwards" });
  animation.timeline = new ScrollTimeline(
    {
      scrollOffsets: [0, CSS.percent(100)]
    }
  );
}
</pre>

## Combination scroll and time-base animations ## {#combination-scroll-and-time-base-animations-usecase}

### Photo viewer ### {#movie-show-case-usecase}

Advisement: We are currently reworking this use case

<!--
Maybe the developer will want to use the scroll based timeline and the time-based timeline.

Here's an example content which showing the photos.
If scroll position is out of specified range, the animation of the slideshow will start. The progress of this slideshow is related to scroll volume. And if scroll position is within the specified range, the animation of the slideshow will continue automatically.

<figure>
<img src="img/usecase4.svg" width="600"
alt="Use case 4: Scrollable slide show.">
 <figcaption>
  Use case 4: Scrollable slide show.<br>
  The left figure is before scroll, the slide show will start as scroll-linked animation.<br>
  The right figure is after scroll, the slide show will start as related to the time animation.
 </figcaption>
</figure>

This content can't build the CSS only.
<pre class='lang-javascript'>
if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)').matches) {
  var animation = slideTarget.getAnimation()[0];
  var scrollTimeline = new ScrollTimeline({
    source: scrollableElement,
    orientation: "vertical",
    scrollOffsets: [CSS.px(0), CSS.px(250)]
  });
  animation.timeline = scrollTimeline;

  // We use scroll event in order to change the timeline.
  scrollableElement.addEventListener("scroll", function(evt) {
    if ((scrollableElement.scrollTop > 200) && animation.timeline != document.timeline) {
      animation.timeline = document.timeline;
    } else if ((scrollableElement.scrollTop < 200) && animation.timeline == document.timeline) {
      animation.timeline = scrollTimeline;
    }
  });
}
</pre>
-->

### The {{ScrollDirection}} enumeration ### {#scrolldirection-enumeration}

<pre class="idl">
enum ScrollDirection {
  "block",
  "inline",
  "horizontal",
  "vertical"
};
</pre>

The {{ScrollDirection}} enumeration specifies a direction of scroll of a
scrollable element.

:   `block`
::  Selects the direction along the [=block axis=], conforming to writing mode
    and directionality.

:   `inline`
::  Selects the direction along the [=inline axis=], confirming to writing mode
    and directionality.

:   `horizontal`
::  Selects the physical horizontal direction (ignoring writing mode and
    directionality).

:   `vertical`
::  Selects the physical vertical direction (ignoring writing mode and
    directionality).

Note: Having both logical (block/inline) and physical (vertical/horizontal)
directions allows web developers to animate both logical (e.g.
margin-inline-start) and physical (e.g. transform) properties with good
behavior under different directionalities and writing modes.

### The {{ScrollTimeline}} interface ### {#scrolltimeline-interface}

<pre class="idl">
enum ScrollTimelineAutoKeyword { "auto" };

typedef (CSSNumericValue or CSSKeywordish) ContainerBasedOffset;
typedef (ContainerBasedOffset or ElementBasedOffset) ScrollTimelineOffset;

dictionary ScrollTimelineOptions {
  Element? source;
  ScrollDirection orientation = "block";
  sequence&lt;ScrollTimelineOffset&gt; scrollOffsets = [];
  (double or ScrollTimelineAutoKeyword) timeRange = "auto";
};

[Exposed=Window]
interface ScrollTimeline : AnimationTimeline {
  constructor(optional ScrollTimelineOptions options = {});
  readonly attribute Element? source;
  readonly attribute ScrollDirection orientation;
  readonly attribute FrozenArray&lt;ScrollTimelineOffset&gt; scrollOffsets;
  readonly attribute (double or ScrollTimelineAutoKeyword) timeRange;
};
</pre>

A <dfn>scroll timeline</dfn> is an {{AnimationTimeline}} whose time values are
determined not by wall-clock time, but by the progress of scrolling in a
[=scroll container=].

<div link-for-hint="ScrollTimeline">

<div class="constructors">

:   <dfn constructor for=ScrollTimeline lt="ScrollTimeline(options)">ScrollTimeline(options)</dfn>
::  Creates a new {{ScrollTimeline}} object using the following procedure:

    1.  Let |timeline| be a new {{ScrollTimeline}} object.

    1.  Let |source| be the result corresponding to the first matching condition
        from the following:

        <div class="switch">

        :   If the `source` member of |options| is missing,
        ::  The {{scrollingElement}} of the {{Document}} <a lt="document
            associated with a window">associated</a> with the {{Window}} that is
            the <a>current global object</a>.

        :   Otherwise,
        ::  The `source` member of |options|.

        </div>

    1.  Set the {{ScrollTimeline/source}} of |timeline| to |source|.

    1.  Assign the {{ScrollTimeline/orientation}}, {{ScrollTimeline/scrollOffsets}}
        and {{ScrollTimeline/timeRange}} properties of
        |timeline| to the corresponding value from |options|.

</div>

<div class="attributes">

:   <dfn attribute for=ScrollTimeline>source</dfn>
::  The scrollable element whose scrolling triggers the activation and drives
    the progress of the timeline.

:   <dfn attribute for=ScrollTimeline>orientation</dfn>
::  Determines the direction of scrolling which triggers the activation and
    drives the progress of the timeline.

:   <dfn attribute for=ScrollTimeline>scrollOffsets</dfn>
::  [=scroll timeline offset=]s which determine the [=effective scroll
    offset=]s in the direction specified by {{orientation}} that constitute the
    equally-distanced in progress intervals in which the timeline is active.

    The procedure to <dfn>set the offset value</dfn> with |val| as the provided
    value, |pos| as the position in {{ScrollTimeline/scrollOffsets}} and |size|
    as the {{ScrollTimeline/scrollOffsets}} array size has the following steps:

    1.  If |val| is a {{DOMString}}, let |val| be the result of
        <a lt="rectify a keywordish value">rectifying the keywordish value</a>.

    2.  Set the offset value to be the result corresponding to the first
        matching condition from the following:

        <div class="switch">

        :   If |val| is a {{CSSKeywordValue}} and <a lt="match the grammar">
            matches the grammar</a> `auto` and |pos| equals to 0 or |size| - 1:
        ::  Return |val|.

        :   If |val| is a {{CSSNumericValue}} and <a lt="match the grammar">
            matches the grammar</a> <<length-percentage>>:
        ::  Return |val|.

        :   If |val| is an {{ElementBasedOffset}}:
        ::  Return |val|.

        :   Otherwise,
        ::  Do not set the value and throw a {{DOMException}} with error name
            {{SyntaxError}}.

        </div>

:   <dfn attribute for=ScrollTimeline>timeRange</dfn>
::  A time duration that allows mapping between a distance scrolled, and
    quantities specified in time units, such as an animation's [=duration=] and
    [=start delay=].

    Conceptually, {{timeRange}} represents the number of milliseconds to map to
    the scroll range defined by {{start}} and {{end}}. As a result, this value
    does not have a correspondence to wall-clock time.

    This value is used to compute the timeline's [=effective time range=], and
    the mapping is then defined by mapping the scroll distance from
    {{start}} to {{end}}, to the [=effective time range=].

Issue(4862): We are working to remove the need for {{timeRange}} to be declared.
The most recent work on this involved introduction of the concept of
"progress-based animations" to web animations.

</div>

### Scroll Timeline Offset ### {#scroll-timeline-offset-section}

An <dfn>effective scroll offset</dfn> is a scroll position for a given [=scroll
container=] and on a given scroll direction.

A <dfn>scroll timeline offset</dfn> is provided by authors and determines a
[=effective scroll offset=] for the {{source}} and in the direction specified by
{{orientation}}.

There are two types of scroll timeline offset: [=container-based offset=], and
[=element-based offset=]. To <dfn>resolve a scroll timeline offset</dfn> into an
[=effective scroll offset=], run the procedure to [=resolve a container-based
offset=] or to [=resolve an element-based offset=] depending on the offset type.
It is possible for a [=scroll timeline offset=] to be resolved to null.

The <dfn>effective start offset</dfn> is the value of first offset in
[=effective scroll offsets=] array or null if the array is empty.

The <dfn>effective end offset</dfn> is the value of last offset in
[=effective scroll offsets=] array or null if the array is empty.

#### Container-based Offset #### {#container-based-offset-section}
A <dfn>container-based offset</dfn> is a scroll timeline offset that is declared
only in relation with the <a>scroll container</a> as specified by {{source}}.

A [=container-based offset=] is provided in the {{CSSNumericValue}} or
{{CSSKeywordValue}} forms.

The procedure to <dfn>resolve a container-based offset</dfn> given
|offset| and a flag <var>is first</var> (to indicate if the <var>offset</var>
is being inserted first into [=effective scroll offsets=]) is as follows:

1.  If <em>any</em> of the following are true:

    * {{source}} is null, or
    * {{source}} does not currently have a [=CSS layout box=], or
    * {{source}}'s layout box is not a [=scroll container=].

    The [=effective scroll offset=] is null and abort remaining steps.

1.  The [=effective scroll offset=] is the scroll offset corresponding to the
    first matching condition from the following:
    <div class="switch">

    :   If |offset| is a {{CSSKeywordValue}} and
        <a lt="match the grammar">matches</a> `auto`:
    ::  The beginning of {{source}}'s scroll range in {{orientation}} if
        <var>is first</var> is true or the ending of {{source}}'s scroll range in
        {{orientation}} otherwise.

    :   If |offset| is a {{CSSNumericValue}} and
        <a lt="match the grammar">matches</a> <<length-percentage>>:
    ::  The distance indicated by the value along {{source}}'s scroll range in
        {{orientation}} as expressed by absolute length, a percentage, or a
        ''calc()'' expression that resolves to a <<length>>.

    :   Otherwise,
    ::  null.

    </div>

Note: The scroll range of an element is the range defined by its minimum and
maximum scroll offsets which are determined by it [=scrolling box=], [=padding
box=], and [=overflow direction=].

Note: Container-based scroll offsets cannot be provided as bare numbers but
should be {{CSSNumericValue}}. This way the full richness of {{CSSNumericValue}}
APIs can be used to provide the offset in percentages, various length units or
'calc()' expressions. For example `CSS.percent(50)`, `CSS.px(200)`, or
`CSS.vh(10)` are valid and represent `50%`, `200px`, and `10vh`.


Note: It is valid to provide a length or percentage based offset such that it is
outside the source's scroll range and thus not reachable e.g., '120%'.

#### Element-based Offset #### {#element-based-offset-section}

An <dfn>element-based offset</dfn> is a scroll timeline offset that is declared
in terms of the intersection of the <a>scroll container</a> as specified by
{{source}} and one of its descendants as specified by {{target}}.

An [=element-based offset=] is provided in the {{ElementBasedOffset}} form.

<pre class="idl">
enum Edge { "start", "end" };

dictionary ElementBasedOffset {
  Element target;
  Edge edge = "start";
  double threshold = 0.0;
};
</pre>


<div class=members>

:   <dfn dict-member for=ElementBasedOffset>target</dfn>
::  The target whose intersection with {{source}}'s [=scrolling box=] determines
    the concrete scroll offset.

:   <dfn dict-member for=ElementBasedOffset>edge</dfn>
::  The edge of {{source}}'s [=scrolling box=] in the direction specified by
    the {{orientation}} which the target should intersect with.

:   <dfn dict-member for=ElementBasedOffset>threshold</dfn>
::  A double in the range of [0.0, 1.0] that represent the percentage
    of the target that is expected to be visible in  {{source}}'s [=scrollport=]
    at the intersection offset.

Issue(5203): The range of the `threshold` member is not currently
checked anywhere.

</div>


The procedure to <dfn>resolve an element-based offset</dfn> given
|offset| is as follows:

1.  If <em>any</em> of the following are true:

    * {{source}} is null, or
    * {{source}} does not currently have a [=CSS layout box=], or
    * {{source}}'s layout box is not a [=scroll container=].

    The [=effective scroll offset=] is null and abort remaining steps.

1.  Let |target| be |offset|'s {{target}}.

1.  If <em>any</em> of the following are true:

    * |target| is null, or
    * |target| does not currently have a [=CSS layout box=].

    The [=effective scroll offset=] is null and abort remaining steps.


1.  If |target| 's nearest [=scroll container=] ancestor
    is not {{source}}
    abort remaining steps
    since the [=effective scroll offset=] is null.

1.  Let |container box| be the {{source}}'s [=scrollport=].

1.  Let |target box| be the result of finding
    the rectangular bounding box
    (axis-aligned in {{source}}’s coordinate space)
    of |target|'s transformed border box.

1.  If |offset|'s {{edge}} is 'start' then
    let |scroll offset|
    be the scroll offset at which |container box|'s start edge is flush
    with the |target box|'s end edge
    in the axis and direction determined by {{orientation}}.

1.  If |offset|'s {{edge}} is 'end' then
    let |scroll offset|
    be the scroll offset at which |container box|'s end edge is flush
    with the |target box|'s start edge
    in the axis and direction determined by {{orientation}}.

1.  Let |threshold amount| be the result of evaluating the following
    expression where |target dimension| is |target box|'s dimension in the axis
    determined by {{orientation}}.
    <blockquote>
      <code>|threshold amount| = {{threshold}} &times; |target dimension|</code>
    </blockquote>


1.  Adjust |scroll offset| by |threshold amount| as follow:
    <div class="switch">

    :   If |offset|'s {{edge}} is 'start',
    ::  |scroll offset| = |scroll offset| - |threshold amount|.

    :   Otherwise (|offset|'s {{edge}} is 'end'),
    ::  |scroll offset| = |scroll offset| + |threshold amount|.

    </div>

1.  Clamp the value of |scroll offset| to be within the {{source}}'s
     scroll range.

1.  The [=effective scroll offset=] is |scroll offset|


<div class="note">
Note: With threshold 0.0, the algorithm selects the effective scroll offset such
that the target is adjacent to the [=scrollport=] at the given edge but not yet
visible.
The threshold value allows authors
to control the amount of target that needs to be visible in [=scrollport=].
In particular threshold value 1.0 ensure that target is fully visible
(as long as [=scrollport=] is large enough).

<figure>
<img src="img/example-element-based-threshold.svg" width="600"
alt="Example usage of element-based offset.">
 <figcaption>
  Threshold controls how much of target should be visible in [=scrollport=].
 </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

<div class="example">
Here is a basic example showing how element-based offsets can be used to declare
an scroll-linked animation that occurs when an element enters the scroller
scrollport and ends once it exits the scrollport.

<figure>
<img src="img/example-element-based.svg" width="600"
alt="Example usage of element-based offset.">
 <figcaption>
  Usage of element-based offsets to create enter/exit triggers.<br>
  The left figure shows the scroller and target being aligned at 'end' edge.<br>
  The right figure shows them being aligned at 'start' edge.
 </figcaption>
</figure>


Note that here we are expecting a typical top to bottom scrolling and thus
consider the entrance to coincide when target's start edge is flushed with
scrollport's <strong>end edge</strong> and viceversa for exit.

<pre class='lang-javascript'>
if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)').matches) {
  const scrollableElement = document.querySelector('#container');
  const image = document.querySelector('#image');

  const timeline = new ScrollTimeline({
    source: scrollableElement,
    scrollOffsets: [{target: image, edge: 'end'},
                    {target: image, edge: 'start'}],
  });

  const slideIn = target.animate({
      transform: ['translateX(0)', 'translateX(50vw)'],
      opacity: [0, 1]
    }, {
      timeline:timeline,
      duration: 1000
    }
  );
}
</pre>

The same logic can be done in CSS markup:
<pre class="lang-css">
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {

  @keyframes slide-in {
    from {
      transform: translateX(0);
      opacity: 0;
    }

    to {
      transform: translateX(50vw);
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }

  @scroll-timeline image-in-scrollport {
    source: selector(#container);
    scroll-offsets: selector(#image) end, selector(#image) start;
  }

  #target {
    animation-name: slide-in;
    animation-duration: 1s;

### The effective time range of a {{ScrollTimeline}} ### {#effective-time-range-algorithm}

The <dfn>effective time range</dfn> of a {{ScrollTimeline}} is calculated as
follows:

<div class="switch">

:   If the {{timeRange}} has the value `"auto"`,
::  The [=effective time range=] is the maximum value of the
    [=target effect end=] of all animations
    directly associated with this timeline.

    If any animation directly associated with the timeline has a
    [=target effect end=] of infinity, the [=effective time range=]
    is zero.

:   Otherwise,
::  The [=effective time range=] is the {{ScrollTimeline}}'s
    {{timeRange}}.

</div>

### The effective scroll offsets of a {{ScrollTimeline}} ### {#effective-scroll-offsets-algorithm}

The <dfn>effective scroll offsets</dfn> are calculated by the procedure to
<dfn>resolve scroll timeline offsets</dfn> from {{ScrollTimeline/scrollOffsets}}
as follows:

1.  Let <var>effective scroll offsets</var> be an empty list of
    <a>effective scroll offset</a>s.
1.  Let <var>first offset</var> be true.
1.  If {{ScrollTimeline/scrollOffsets}} is empty
    1.  Run the procedure to [=resolve a scroll timeline offset=] for 'auto'
        with the <var>is first</var> flag set to <var>first offset</var> and
        add the resulted value into <var>effective scroll offsets</var>.
    1.  Set <var>first offset</var> to false.
    1.  Run the procedure to [=resolve a scroll timeline offset=] for 'auto'
        with the <var>is first</var> flag set to <var>first offset</var> and
        add the resulted value into <var>effective scroll offsets</var>.
1.  If {{ScrollTimeline/scrollOffsets}} has exactly one element
    1.  Run the procedure to [=resolve a scroll timeline offset=] for 'auto'
        with the <var>is first</var> flag set to <var>first offset</var> and
        add the resulted value into <var>effective scroll offsets</var>.
    1.  Set <var>first offset</var> to false.
1.  For each <var>scroll offset</var> in the list of
    {{ScrollTimeline/scrollOffsets}}, perform the following steps:
    1.  Let <var>effective offset</var> be the result of applying the procedure
        to [=resolve a scroll timeline offset=] for <var>scroll offset</var>
        with the <var>is first</var> flag set to <var>first offset</var>.
    1.  If <var>effective offset</var> is null, the
        [=effective scroll offsets=] is empty and abort the remaining steps.
    1.  Add <var>effective offset</var> into
        <var>effective scroll offsets</var>.
    1.  Set <var>first offset</var> to false.
1.  Return <var>effective scroll offsets</var>.

### The progress of a {{ScrollTimeline}} ### {#progress-calculation-algorithm}
The <dfn>scroll timeline progress</dfn> is calculated by applying the procedure
to <dfn>calculate scroll timeline progress</dfn> given |offset| as follows:

1.  Let <var>scroll offsets</var> be the result of applying the procedure to
    [=resolve scroll timeline offsets=] for {{scrollOffsets}}.
1.  Let <var>offset index</var> correspond to the position of the last offset in
    <var>scroll offsets</var> whose value is less than or equal to
    <var>offset</var> and the value at the following position greater than
    <var>offset</var.
1.  Let <var>start offset</var> be the offset value at position
    <var>offset index</var> in <var>scroll offsets</var>.
1.  Let <var>end offset</var> be the value of next offset in <var>scroll
    offsets</var> after <var>start offset</var>.
1.  Let <var>size</var> be the number of offsets in <var>scroll offsets</var>.
1.  Let <var>offset weight</var> be the result of evaluating
    <code> 1 / (<var>size</var> - 1)</code>.
1.  Let <var>interval progress</var> be the result of evaluating
    <code>(<var>offset</var> - <var>start offset</var>) /
    (<var>end offset</var> - <var>start offset</var>)</code>.
1.  Return the result of evaluating
    <code>(<var>offset index</var> + <var>interval progress</var>) &times;
    <var>offset weight</var></code>.

Note: This procedure guarantees that given <var>offset</var> belongs to
scroll range within first and last offsets of <var>scroll offsets</var>.
This is because the case when <var>offset</var> falls outside of the scroll
range is handled before calling this procedure, as part of [=current time=]
calculation.

Note: The rationale behind choosing last matching offset in the array is to
be consistent with [=findRule=] method for finding which [=CSSKeyframeRule=]
applies in a comma separated list of overlapping keyframes.

### The phase of a {{ScrollTimeline}} ### {#phase-algorithm}

The [=phase=] of a {{ScrollTimeline}} is calculated as follows:

1.  If <em>any</em> of the following are true:

    * {{source}} is null, or
    * {{source}} does not currently have a [=CSS layout box=], or
    * {{source}}'s layout box is not a [=scroll container=], or
    * [=effective scroll offsets=] is empty.

    The [=phase=] is [=inactive phase|inactive=] and abort remaining steps.

1.  Let |current scroll offset| be the current scroll offset of
    {{source}} in the direction specified by {{orientation}}.

1.  The [=phase=] is the result corresponding to the first matching condition
    from below:

<div class="switch">

:   If |current scroll offset| is less than [=effective start offset=]:
::  The [=phase=] is [=before phase|before=]

:   If |current scroll offset| is greater than or equal to [=effective
    end offset=] <em>and</em> [=effective end offset=] is less than the maximum
    scroll offset of {{source}} in {{orientation}}:

::  The [=phase=] is [=after phase|after=]

Note: In web animations, in general ranges are normally exclusive of their end
point. But there is an exception here for the scroll timeline active range as it
may in some cases be inclusive of its end. In particular if the timeline end
offset is the maximum scroll offset we include it in active range because it is
not possible for user to scroll passed this point and not including this value
in the active range would leave to animations that would not be active at the
very last scroll position.

:   Otherwise,
::  The [=phase=] is [=active phase|active=].

</div>

### The current time of a {{ScrollTimeline}} ### {#current-time-algorithm}

The [=current time=] of a {{ScrollTimeline}} is calculated as follows:

1.  If <em>any</em> of the following are true:

    * {{source}} is null, or
    * {{source}} does not currently have a [=CSS layout box=], or
    * {{source}}'s layout box is not a [=scroll container=], or
    * [=effective scroll offsets=] is empty.

    The [=current time=] is an unresolved time value and abort remaining steps.

1.  Let |current scroll offset| be the current scroll offset of
    {{source}} in the direction specified by {{orientation}}.

1.  The [=current time=] is the result corresponding to the first matching
    condition from below:

<div class="switch">

:   If |current scroll offset| is less than [=effective start offset=]:
::  The [=current time=] is 0.

:   If |current scroll offset| is greater than or equal to [=effective
    end offset=]:
::  The [=current time=] is the [=effective time range=].

:   Otherwise,
::  1.  Let |progress| be a result of applying
        [=calculate scroll timeline progress=] procedure for <var>current scroll offset</var>.
    1.  The [=current time=] is the result of evaluating the following expression:

    <blockquote>
      <code>|progress| &times; [=effective time range=]</code>
    </blockquote>

</div>
Note: To be considered active a scroll timeline requires its [=effective scroll
offsets=] to be non-empty. This means that for example if one uses an
element-based offset whose {{target}} is not a descendant of the scroll timeline
{{source}}, the timeline remains inactive.

## The '@scroll-timeline' at-rule ## {#scroll-timeline-at-rule}

[=Scroll Timelines=] are specified in CSS using the <dfn>@scroll-timeline</dfn>
at-rule, defined as follows:

<pre>
  @scroll-timeline = @scroll-timeline <<timeline-name>> { <<declaration-list>> }

</pre>

An ''@scroll-timeline'' rule has a name given by the <<custom-ident>> or <<string>> in
its prelude. The two syntaxes are equivalent in functionality; the name is the
value of the ident or string. As normal for <<custom-ident>>s and <<string>>s,
the names are fully case-sensitive; two names are equal only if they are
codepoint-by-codepoint equal. The <<custom-ident>> additionally excludes the
none keyword.

Once specified, a scroll timeline may be associated with a CSS Animation
[[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]] by using the 'animation-timeline' property.

The <<declaration-list>> inside of ''@scroll-timeline'' rule can only contain the
descriptors defined in this section.

An ''@scroll-timeline'' rule is invalid if it occurs in a stylesheet inside of a
[=shadow tree=], and must be ignored.

Issue(5167): This will likely change in the future.

### Scroll Timeline descriptors ### {#scroll-timeline-descriptors}


<pre class='descdef'>
  Name: source
  For: @scroll-timeline
  Value: selector( <<id-selector>> ) | auto | none
  Initial: auto
</pre>

'source' descriptor determines the scroll timeline's {{source}}.

The value of {{source}} is the result corresponding to the first matching
condition from the following:

<div class="switch">

:   If 'source' is a 'selector()'
::  The [=scroll container=] identified by the <<id-selector>>.

:   If 'source' is `auto`
::  The {{scrollingElement}} of the {{Document}} <a lt="document associated with
    a window">associated</a> with the {{Window}} that is the
    <a>current global object</a>.

:   Otherwise ('source' is `none`)
::  null.

</div>

Issue(4338): Consider choosing animation target's nearest scrollable ancestor
instead of document's scrolling Element for `auto`.

<pre class='descdef'>
  Name: orientation
  For: @scroll-timeline
  Value: auto | block | inline | horizontal | vertical
  Initial: auto
</pre>

'orientation' descriptor determines the scroll timeline's {{orientation}}.

<pre class='descdef'>
  Name: scroll-offsets
  For: @scroll-timeline
  Value: [ none | <<scroll-timeline-offset>> ]#
  Initial: none
</pre>

'scroll-offsets' descriptor determines the scroll timeline's {{scrollOffsets}}.

[=Scroll timeline offsets=] in CSS are represented by the
<<scroll-timeline-offset>> type:

<pre>
<dfn>&lt;scroll-timeline-offset></dfn> = auto | <<length-percentage>> | <<element-offset>>
<dfn>&lt;element-offset></dfn> = selector( <<id-selector>> ) [<<element-offset-edge>> || <<number>>]?
<dfn>&lt;element-offset-edge></dfn> = start | end
</pre>

The offset type depends on the value of <<scroll-timeline-offset>> per
following:
<div class="switch">
:   If value is "auto" or of type <<length-percentage>>
::  The [=scroll timeline offset=] is a [=container-based offset=] with the same
    value.

:   If value is of type <<element-offset>>
::  The [=scroll timeline offset=] is an [=element-based offset=] with the
    following member values:
      *  {{ElementBasedOffset/target}} is the element identified by
          <<id-selector>>.
      * {{ElementBasedOffset/edge}} is the optional value of
        <<element-offset-edge>>. If not provided it defaults to "start".
      * {{ElementBasedOffset/threshold}} is the optional value <<number>>. If
        not provided it defaults to 0.

</div>

<pre class='descdef'>
  Name: time-range
  For: @scroll-timeline
  Value: auto | <<time>>
  Initial: auto
</pre>

'time-range' descriptor determines the scroll timeline's {{timeRange}}.

</div>  <!-- link-for-hint="ScrollTimeline" -->

# Avoiding cycles with layout # {#avoiding-cycles}

The ability for scrolling to drive the progress of an animation, gives rise to
the possibility of <dfn>layout cycles</dfn>, where a change to a scroll offset
causes an animation's effect to update, which in turn causes a new change to the
scroll offset.

To avoid such [=layout cycles=], animations with a {{ScrollTimeline}} are
sampled once per frame, after scrolling in response to input events has taken
place, but before {{requestAnimationFrame()}} callbacks are run. If the sampling
of such an animation causes a change to a scroll offset, the animation will not
be re-sampled to reflect the new offset until the next frame.

The implication of this is that in some situations, in a given frame, the
rendered scroll offset of a scroll container may not be consistent with the state
of an animation driven by scrolling that scroll container. However, this will
only occur in situations where the animation's effect changes the scroll offset
of that same scroll container (in other words, in situations where the animation's
author is asking for trouble). In normal situations, including - importantly -
when scrolling happens in response to input events, the rendered scroll offset
and the state of scroll-driven animations will be consistent in each frame.

User agents that composite frames asynchronously with respect to layout and/or
script may, at their discretion, sample scroll-driven animations once per
<em>composited</em> frame, rather than (or in addition to) once per full layout
cycle. Again, if sampling such an animation causes a change to a scroll offset,
the animation will not be re-sampled to reflect the new offset until the next
frame.

Nothing in this section is intended to require that scrolling block on layout
or script. If a user agent normally composites frames where scrolling has
occurred but the consequences of scrolling have not been fully propagated in
layout or script (for example, `scroll` event listeners have not yet
run), the user agent may likewise choose not to sample scroll-driven animations
for that composited frame. In such cases, the rendered scroll offset and the
state of a scroll-driven animation may be inconsistent in the composited frame.
