<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	<em>This section is not normative.</em>

	[[CSS-MULTICOL-1#column-gaps-and-rules]] allows for rules to be drawn
	between columns in a <a>multicol container</a>. This specification expands
	upon the 'column-rule-width', 'column-rule-style', and 'column-rule-color'
	properties, adding equivalents in the row direction, expanding their
	application to other container layouts, and giving advanced control over
	where and how gap decorations are painted.

<h3 id="values">
Value Definitions</h3>

	This specification follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]]
	using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs">value definition syntax</a> from [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values &amp; Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification
	also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> as their property value.
	For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

<h2 id="gap-decorations">
Gap decorations</h2>

	Various layouts in CSS such as
	<a>multicol containers</a>, <a>flex containers</a>, <a>grid containers</a>, and <a>grid lanes containers</a>
	position child boxes adjacent to each other with gaps, also known as <a>gutters</a>, between them.
	Each such gap may contain a <dfn>gap decoration</dfn>,
	which is a visible separator (such as a line) painted between adjacent boxes.

	<div class="example">
		<pre>
			.grid-with-spans {
			  display: grid;
			  grid-template: repeat(4, 100px) / repeat(4, 100px);
			  gap: 20px;
			  row-rule: 6px solid red;
			  column-rule: 6px solid blue;
			}
		</pre>
		<figure>
			<img alt="" src="images/example-grid-with-spans.png">
			<figcaption>A grid with spanning items and gap decorations.</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		<pre>
			.flex {
			  display: flex;
			  flex-wrap: wrap;
			  gap: 20px;
			  width: 500px;
			  row-rule: 6px solid red;
			  column-rule: 6px solid blue;
			}
		</pre>
		<figure>
			<img alt="" src="images/example-flex.png">
			<figcaption>A flexbox with gap decorations.</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>

<h3 id="layout-painting">
Layout and painting</h3>

	This specification does not generally define the geometry of gaps in container layouts;
	that is left to other specifications.
	See [[CSS-ALIGN-3#gaps]] for definitions pertaining to
	<a>multicol containers</a>, <a>flex containers</a>, and <a>grid containers</a>.

	<a>Gap decorations</a> do not take up space.
	That is, the presence or width of a <a>gap decoration</a> will not alter the placement of anything else.
	If a <a>gap decoration</a> is wider than its gap,
	any adjacent boxes will overlap the decoration,
	and in some cases the decoration may extend outside the box of the container.
	<a>Gap decorations</a> are painted just above the border of the container.
	For scrollable containers,
	note that while the border and background of the container aren't scrolled,
	the decorations need to scroll along with items in the container.

	A <dfn>gap intersection point</dfn> is defined to exist in each of the following locations:
	<ul>
		<li>The center of the start or end edge of a [=gutter=].</li>
		<li>The center of an intersection between gaps in different directions.</li>
	</ul>

	The following examples illustrate the locations of <a>gap intersection points</a>,
	marked with a magenta <span style="color:#f0f">+</span> in each case.

	<div class="example">
		<pre>
			.grid {
				display: grid;
				grid-template: repeat(4, 100px) / repeat(4, 100px);
				gap: 20px;
				background: rgb(255 255 128);
			}
			.grid > * {
				border: 1px dashed black;
			}
		</pre>
		<figure>
			<img alt="" src="images/example-gap-intersection-grid.png">
			<figcaption>
				Locations of <a>gap intersection points</a> in a grid with spanning items.
				Note the presence of <a>gap intersection points</a>
				even where a spanning item touches the edge of a container,
				and where an intersection is flanked by spanning items on either side
				(for example between #2 and #6, or #4 and #7).
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		<pre>
			.flex {
				display: flex;
				flex-wrap: wrap;
				gap: 20px;
				width: 500px;
				background: rgb(255 255 128);
			}
			.flex > * {
				border: 1px dashed black;
			}
		</pre>
		<figure>
			<img alt="" src="images/example-gap-intersection-flex.png">
			<figcaption>
				Locations of <a>gap intersection points</a> in a flexbox.
				Note the presence of <a>gap intersection points</a> at edges of the container,
				and the presence of two <a>gap intersection points</a> in close proximity where
				items in adjacent rows don't quite line up with each other (between #2, #3, #4, and, #5).
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>

	Note: [[CSS-ALIGN-3#column-row-gap]] defines
	cross-direction gaps in flex containers
	as being between adacent flex items in a single line.
	Thus, in the example above,
	even though the right edges of #4 and #7 line up,
	and the left edges of #5 and #8 line up,
	the spaces between those two pairs of items are <em>two distinct gaps</em>
	since they are on different lines.
	Therefore, the intersection between #4, #5, #7, and #8
	contains two <a>gap intersection points</a> whose locations coincide:
	one at the bottom of the gap between #4 and #5,
	and one at the top of the gap between #7 and #8.

	<a>Gap decorations</a> are painted relative to pairs of <a>gap intersection points</a>,
	in the center of the corresponding gap and parallel to its edges.

	[[css-align-3#column-row-gap]] specifies that gaps disappear
	where they coincide with a [=fragmentation break=].
	Because there is no gap in such locations,
	no [=gap decoration=] is drawn in them either.

	If the positions of one or more gaps coincide exactly due to being [=collapsed gutter|collapsed=],
	at most one decoration will be drawn for that set of gaps.
	The decoration that is drawn is selected according to the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#border-conflict-resolution">border conflict resolution</a> rules for tables.

<h3 id="break">
Breaking gap decorations into segments: The 'column-rule-break', 'row-rule-break', and 'rule-break' properties</h3>

	<pre class='propdef'>
		Name: column-rule-break, row-rule-break
		Value: ''none'' | ''spanning-item'' | ''intersection''
		Initial: ''spanning-item''
		Applies to: <a>grid containers</a>, <a>flex containers</a>, <a>multicol containers</a>, and <a>grid lanes containers</a>
		Inherited: no
		Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	Sets the behavior for breaking decorations within a given gap into segments
	at visible "T" or "cross" intersections formed by items in the container.
	Precise details for how to apply these values are given in the steps to <a>determine pairs of gap decoration endpoints</a>.

	<dl dfn-type="value" dfn-for="column-rule-break, row-rule-break">
		<dt><dfn>none</dfn>
		<dd>
			Gap decorations do not start or end at visible "T" or "cross" intersections.
			Instead, a single continuous decoration is painted from one end of the gap to the other.
		</dd>
		<dt><dfn>spanning-item</dfn>
		<dd>
			Gap decorations start and end at visible "T" intersections but continue through visible "cross" intersections.
		</dd>

<h4 id="pairing">
Pairing gap intersection points into segments</h4>

	<div algorithm>
		In the context of a given |gap|,
		a pair of <a>gap intersection points</a> |a| and |b| is considered
		<dfn noexport>discontiguous</dfn>
		if a line segment from |a| to |b|,
		with the same width as |gap|,
		intersects a child item in the container.

		Note: The primary use case for this definition is to avoid having
		<a>gap decorations</a> intersect spanning items when not intended by the author,
		for example when a spanning item touches the edge of the container,
		or when a spanning item forms a "T intersection".
		However, the specific phrasing of the definition
		is also intended to address cases such as the one below:
		<br>
		<img alt="" src="images/flex-offset-gap.png">
		<br>
		The four marked <a>gap intersection points</a> fall along a common gap centerline.
		However, because item 3 is slightly wider than items 1 and 5,
		the second and third points from the top are <a>discontiguous</a>.
		Thus, the two upper <a>gap intersection points</a> form a pair,
		and the two lower <a>gap intersection points</a> form a pair.
		(There is an additional pair of <a>gap intersection points</a>,
		slightly offset to the right of the two middle points,
		which are not marked.
		These points will form another pair.)
	</div>

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn>determine pairs of gap decoration endpoints</dfn> within a given |gap|:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Let |pairs| be an empty list.
				Let |endpoints| be the list of <a>gap intersection points</a> that fall along the centerline of |gap|,
				ordered from start to end along |gap|'s axis.
				Let |break| be the used value of either 'column-rule-break' or 'row-rule-break',
				whichever applies to |gap|.
			</li>

			<li>
				If |endpoints| contains fewer than 2 items, return |pairs|.
			</li>

			<li>
				If |break| is other than ''column-rule-break/none'',
				and the first two items in |endpoints| are <a>discontiguous</a>,
				remove the first item from |endpoints|, then go back to step 2.
			</li>

			<li>
				Remove the first item from |endpoints|.
				Let |start| be equal to that item.
			</li>

			<li>
				Remove the first item from |endpoints|.
				Let |end| be equal to that item.
			</li>

			<li>
				If |endpoints| is non-empty, and any of the following conditions are true...
				<ol>
					<li>
						|break| is ''column-rule-break/none''.
					</li>
					<li>
						|break| is ''column-rule-break/spanning-item'',
						and |start| is not <a>discontiguous</a> with the first item in |endpoints|.
					</li>
					<li>
						|break| is ''column-rule-break/intersection'',
						and |start| is not <a>discontiguous</a> with the first item in |endpoints|,
						and the intersection is flanked by spanning items on opposing sides.
					</li>
				</ol>
				...then go back to step 5.
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Compute the offset</a> for |start| within |gap|.
				Offset |start| by the result,
				in the forward direction along |gap|'s axis.
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Compute the offset</a> for |end| within |gap|.
				Offset |end| by the result,
				in the reverse direction along |gap|'s axis.
			</li>

			<li>
				Add to |pairs| a tuple consisting of |start| and |end|.
			</li>

			<li>
				Go back to step 2.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	A <a>gap decoration</a> is painted between each pair of endpoints identified using the steps above.

	The following examples illustrate various settings for the <a href="#break">*-rule-break</a> properties.
	To make the differences more apparent, the <a href="#inset">*-rule-*-inset</a> properties are set to ''0''.

	These properties can be used to offset the endpoints of <a>gap decorations</a> relative to the
	<a>gap intersection points</a> which would normally determine their endpoints.

	For the interior properties, 
	a value of ''-50%'' places the <a>gap decoration</a> endpoint in the center of the intersection,
	and a value of ''0'' places the <a>gap decoration</a> endpoint at the edge of the intersection.

	<dl dfn-for=rule-inset dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			The used value of ''auto'' is ''0'' for edge properties and ''-50%'' for interior properties.
	</dl>

	<p>An <dfn>edge gap intersection point</dfn> is any [=gap intersection point=] at the content edges of the container.</p>
	<p>An <dfn>interior gap intersection point</dfn> is any [=gap intersection point=] that is not an [=edge gap intersection point=].</p>
	<p>A <dfn>decoration segment</dfn> refers to any segment that connects a pair of adjacent [=gap intersection points=].</p>
	<p>A <dfn>start endpoint</dfn> and <dfn>end endpoint</dfn> refer to the two endpoints of a given [=decoration segment=].
	A given [=start endpoint=] and [=end endpoint=] can be either an [=edge gap intersection point=] or an [=interior gap intersection point=].</p>

	The ''column-rule-edge-inset-start'' and ''row-rule-edge-inset-start'' properties control the behavior for any [=start endpoint=] that is an [=edge gap intersection point=],
	while the ''column-rule-edge-inset-end'' and ''row-rule-edge-inset-end'' properties control the behavior for any [=end endpoint=] that is an [=edge gap intersection point=].
	Positive values recede inwards from the content edge, while negative values extend outwards, beyond the container's content bounds.

	The ''column-rule-interior-inset-start'' and ''row-rule-interior-inset-start'' properties control the behavior for any [=start endpoint=] that is an [=interior gap intersection point=],
	while the ''column-rule-interior-inset-end'' and ''row-rule-interior-inset-end'' properties control the behavior for any [=end endpoint=] that is an [=interior gap intersection point=].
	Positive values recede away from the intersection, while negative values extend towards the center of the intersection.

<h3 id="lists-repeat">
Lists of values and the ''repeat-line-color/repeat()'' notation</h3>

	Each of the properties in this section accepts a space-separated list of values.
	Setting multiple values in this way allows for varying <a>gap decorations</a> within a given container.

	<div class="example">
		An author might specify alternating red and blue column rules as follows:
		<pre>
			column-rule-width: 1px;
			column-rule-style: solid;
			column-rule-color: red blue;
		</pre>
	</div>

	Such a list may contain <dfn for="<repeat-line-color>,<auto-repeat-line-color>,<repeat-line-style>,<auto-repeat-line-style>,<repeat-line-width>,<auto-repeat-line-width>">repeat()</dfn> notations.
	Similar to [[css-grid-1#repeat-notation]], these notations allow a series of <a>gap decorations</a>
	that exhibit a recurring pattern to be written in a more compact form.

	The generic form of the ''repeat-line-color/repeat()'' syntax is, approximately,
	<pre class='prod'>
		repeat( [ <<integer [1,∞]>> | auto ] , &lt;value&gt;+ )
	</pre>

	The first argument to ''repeat-line-color/repeat()'' specifies the number of repetitions.
	<dl>
		<dt><<integer>>
		<dd>
			Specifies an <dfn>integer repeater</dfn>.
			An <a>integer repeater</a> expands out to the list of values in the second argument,
			repeated as many times as specified by the first argument.

			<div class="example">
				An author may write:
				<pre>
					column-rule-color: gray red blue red blue red blue gray;
				</pre>
				Or shorten to the following, which produces the same sequence of colors:
				<pre>
					column-rule-color: gray repeat(3, red blue) gray;
				</pre>
			</div>

		<dt>auto
		<dd>
			Specfies an <dfn>auto repeater</dfn>.
			An <a>auto repeater</a> will be used to fill in values for gaps
			that would not otherwise receive values from other parts of the list.
			At most one ''repeat-line-color/repeat()'' in a given list of values may be an <a>auto repeater</a>.

			<div class="example">
				Continuing from the previous example, if the author does not know how
				many columns will be in the final layout, they might instead write:
				<pre>
					column-rule-color: gray repeat(auto, red blue) gray;
				</pre>
				Which will produce a gray decoration in the first and last column gaps,
				and alternating red and blue decorations in the in-between column gaps.
			</div>
	</dl>

	The second argument to ''repeat-line-color/repeat()'' is a space-separated list of values
	that would be accepted by the property in which the ''repeat-line-color/repeat()'' appears.

<h4 id="interpolation-behavior">Interpolation behavior</h4>
When interpolating ''repeat()'' values, or lists of values for 'rule-color' or 'rule-width', the interpolation proceeds in two steps:

	<ol>
	<li><em>Expansion:</em> Expand any [=integer repeater=] into its equivalent list of values. </li>
	<li><em>List Interpolation:</em> Apply the [=repeatable list=] interpolation algorithm to the expanded lists, interpolating each item against its counterpart.</li>

Changes since the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-css-gaps-1-20250417/">17 April 2025 Working Draft</a></h3>

	<ul class="non-normative">
		<li>Specified the behavior when gaps are coincident due to track collapsing.
			(<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11814">Issue 11814</a>)
		<li>Added links to WPT suite.
		<li>Updated 'rule-paint-order' to 'rule-overlap'. (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12540">Issue 12540</a>)

		<li>Updated trailing gap decoration assignment to use values in forward order. (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12527">Issue 12527</a>)
		<li>Specified the interpolation behavior for values which may contain repeaters.
			(<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12431">Issue 12431</a>)
		<li>Removed the special case of 'column-rule-width' having a computed value of ''0'' when 'column-rule-style' is ''<line-style>/none'' or ''<line-style>/hidden''.
			(<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11494">Issue 11494</a>)
		<li> Updated `*-outset` to `*-inset` and introduced related properties.
