Abstract: This CSS module defines a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, optimized for tabular data rendering. In the table layout model, each display node is assigned to an intersection between a set of consecutive rows and a set of consecutive columns, themselves generated from the table structure and sized according to their content.
Ignored Terms: block-level box

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

	<em>This section is not normative</em>

	Many types of information (ex: weather readings collected over the past year)
		are best visually represented in a two-axis grid
		where rows represent one item of the list
			(ex: a date, and the various weather properties measured during that day),
		and where columns represent the successive values of an items property
			(ex: the temperatures measured over the past year).

	Sometimes, to make the representation easier to understand,
		some cells of the grid are used to represent a description or summary of their parent row/column,
		instead of actual data.
	This happens more frequently for
		the cells found on the first row and/or column (called headers)
		or the cells found on the last row and/or column (called footers).


	This kind of tabular data representation is usually known as tables.
	Tables layout can be abused to render other grid-like representations like calendars or timelines,
		though authors should prefer other layout modes
		when the information being represented does not make sense as a data table.

	The rendering of tables in HTML has been defined for a long time in the HTML specification.
	However, its interactions with features defined in CSS remained for a long time undefined.
	The goal of this specification is to define
		the expected behavior of user agents supporting both HTML tables and CSS.

	Please be aware that some behaviors defined in this document
		will not be the most logical or useful way of solving the problem they aim to solve,
		but such behaviors are often the result of compatibility requirements and not a deliberate choice
		of the editors of this specification.
	Authors wishing to use more complex layouts
		are encouraged to rely on more modern CSS modules such as CSS Grids.

<h2 id="content-model">Content Model</h2>

	<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
	<h3 id="table-structure">Table Structure</h3>

	The CSS table model is based on the HTML4 table model,
		in which the structure of a table closely parallels the visual layout of the table.
	In this model, a table consists of an optional caption and any number of rows of cells.

	In addition, adjacent rows and columns may be grouped structurally and
	this grouping can be reflected in presentation (e.g., a border may be drawn around a group of rows).

	The table model is said to be "row primary" since
		authors specify rows, not columns, explicitly in the document language.
	Columns are derived once all the rows have been specified:
		the first cell of the first row belongs to the first column
			and as many other columns as spanning requires (and it creates them if needed),
		and the following cells of that row each belong to the next available column
			and as many other columns as spanning requires (creating those if needed);
		the cells of the following rows each belong to the next available column for that row (taking rowspan into account)
			and as many other columns as spanning requires (creating those if needed).
		<span class="hint">(see [[#dimensioning-the-row-column-grid]])</span>.

	To summarize, an instance of the table model consists of:
	<ul class="compact">
		<li>Its <a href="#table-root-element">table-root</a> containing:
		<ul>
			<li>Zero, one or more <a href="#table-row">table rows</a>, optionally in <a href="#table-row-group">row groups</a>,
				<ul><li>Each of them contaning one or more <a href="#table-cell">table cells</a></li></ul>
			<li>Optionally: one or more <a href="#table-column">table columns</a>,
				optionally in <a href="#table-column-group">column groups</a>
			<li>Optionally: one or more <a href="#table-caption">table caption</a>.
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<style>
		ul.compact { margin-top: -1em !important; list-style-type: disc; }
		ul.compact li { margin-top: 0 !important; margin-bottom: 0 !important; list-style-type: disc; }
	</style>

	<figure>
		<img src="images/table-structure.png" width=493 />
		<figcaption>Two representations of the structure of a table (tree vs layout)</figcaption>
	</figure>

	The CSS model does not require that the document language include elements that correspond to each of these components.
	For document languages (such as XML applications) that do not have pre-defined table elements,
		authors must map document language elements to table elements.
	This is done with the 'display' property.

	The following 'display' values assign table formatting rules to an arbitrary element:

	<dl id="display-types">
		<dt><dfn>table</dfn> (equivalent to HTML: &lt;table&gt;)
		<dd>Specifies that an element defines a block-level table:
			it is a rectangular block that participates in a block formatting context.

		<dt><dfn>inline-table</dfn> (equivalent to HTML: &lt;table&gt;)
		<dd>Specifies that an element defines an inline-level table:
			it is a rectangular block that participates in an inline formatting context).

		<dt><dfn>table-row</dfn> (equivalent to HTML: &lt;tr&gt;)
		<dd>Specifies that an element is a row of cells.

		<dt><dfn>table-row-group</dfn> (equivalent to HTML: &lt;tbody&gt;)
		<dd>Specifies that an element groups some amount of rows. 

			Unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, mentions of table-row-groups in this spec also encompass the specialized table-header-groups and table-footer-groups.

		<dt><dfn>table-header-group</dfn> (equivalent to HTML: &lt;thead&gt;)
		<dd>Like table-row-group but, for layout purposes,
			the first such row group is always displayed before all other rows and row groups.

			<div class="advisement">
				If a table owns multiple <code>display: table-header-group</code> boxes,
					only the first is treated as a header;
					the others are treated as if they had <code>display: table-row-group</code>.
			</div>

		<dt><dfn>table-footer-group</dfn> (equivalent to HTML: &lt;tfoot&gt;)
		<dd>Like table-row-group but, for layout purposes,
			the fist such row group is always displayed after all other rows and row groups.

			<div class="advisement">
				If a table owns multiple <code>display: table-footer-group</code> boxes,
					only the first is treated as a footer;
					the others are treated as if they had <code>display: table-row-group</code>.
			</div>

		<dt><dfn>table-column</dfn> (equivalent to HTML: &lt;col&gt;)
		<dd>Specifies that an element describes a column of cells.

		<dt><dfn>table-column-group</dfn> (equivalent to HTML: &lt;colgroup&gt;)
		<dd>Specifies that an element groups one or more columns.

		<dt><dfn>table-cell</dfn> (equivalent to HTML: &lt;td&gt; or &lt;th&gt;)
		<dd>Specifies that an element represents a table cell.

		<dt><dfn>table-caption</dfn> (equivalent to HTML: &lt;caption&gt;)
		<dd>Specifies a caption for the table.
			Table captions are positioned between the table margins and its borders.
	</dl>

	<p class="advisement">
		Authors should not assign a display type from the previous list to replaced elements (eg: input fields or images).
		When the 'display' property of a replaced element computes to one of these values,
			it is handled instead as though the author had declared
			<code>inline</code> (for <a>inline-table</a>, <a>table-cell</a>, <a>table-column</a>) or
			<code>block</code> (for all other values).
		Whitespace collapsing and box generation must happen around those replaced elements
			like if they never had any other display type.
		<br/>

	<h3 id="fixup">Fixup</h3>

		Document languages other than HTML may not contain all the elements in the CSS 2.1 table model.
		In these cases, the "missing" elements must be assumed in order for the table model to work.

		Any <a>table-internal</a> element will automatically generate necessary anonymous table objects around itself, if necessary.
		Any descendant of a <a>table-root</a> that is not table-internal
			must have a set of ancestors in the table consisting of
			at least three nested objects corresponding to
			a <a>table</a>/<a>inline-table</a>,
			a <a>table-row</a>, and
			a <a>table-cell</a>.
		Missing boxes cause the generation of <a href="#fixup-boxes">anonymous boxes</a> according to the following rules:

		<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
		<h4 id="fixup-algorithm">Fixup Algorithm</h4>

			For the purposes of these rules, out-of-flow elements are represented as inline elements of zero width and height.
			Their containing blocks are chosen accordingly.

			The following steps are performed in three stages:

			<ol>
				<li><b>Remove irrelevant boxes:</b><br/>
					The following boxes are discarded as if they were <code>display:none</code>:
					<ol>
						<li>Children of a <a>table-column</a>.

						<li>Children of a <a>table-column-group</a> which are not a <a>table-column</a>.

						<li>Anonymous inline boxes which contain only white space and
							are between two immediate siblings each of which is a <a>table-non-root</a> box.

						<li>Anonymous inline boxes which meet all of the following criteria:
							<ul>
								<li>they contain only white space
								<li>they are the first and/or last child of a <a>tabular container</a>
								<li>whose immediate sibling, if any, is a <a>table-non-root</a> box
							</ul>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li><b>Generate missing child wrappers:</b>
					<ol>
						<li>An anonymous <a>table-row</a> box must be generated
							around each sequence of consecutive children of a <a>table-root</a> box
							which are not <a>proper table child</a> boxes.
							<a class="hint" href="https://jsfiddle.net/hj2w7wwa/2/">!!Testcase</a>

						<li>An anonymous <a>table-row</a> box must be generated
							around each sequence of consecutive children of a <a>table-row-group</a> box
							which are not <a>table-row</a> boxes.
							<a class="hint" href="https://jsfiddle.net/hj2w7wwa/3/">!Testcase</a>

						<li>An anonymous <a>table-cell</a> box must be generated
							around each sequence of consecutive children of a <a>table-row</a> box
							which are not <a>table-cell</a> boxes.
							<a class="hint" href="https://jsfiddle.net/hj2w7wwa/4/">!Testcase</a>

					</ol>
				</li>
				<li><b>Generate missing parents:</b>
					<ol>
						<li>An anonymous <a>table-row</a> box must be generated
							around each sequence of consecutive <a>table-cell</a> boxes
							whose parent is not a <a>table-row</a>.
							<a class="hint" href="https://jsfiddle.net/hj2w7wwa/5/">Testcase</a>

						<li>An anonymous <a>table</a> or <a>inline-table</a> box must be generated
							around each sequence of consecutive <a>proper table child</a> boxes
							which are misparented.
							If the box's parent is an inline, run-in, or ruby box (or any box that would perform inlinification of its children),
								then an <a>inline-table</a> box must be generated;
								otherwise it must be a <a>table</a> box.
							<ul>
								<li>A <a>table-row</a> is misparented
									if its parent is neither a <a>table-row-group</a> nor a <a>table-root</a> box.
								<li>A <a>table-column</a> box is misparented
									if its parent is neither a <a>table-column-group</a> box nor a <a>table-root</a> box.
								<li>A <a>table-row-group</a>, <a>table-column-group</a>, or <a>table-caption</a> box is misparented
									if its parent is not a <a>table-root</a> box.

							<a class="hint" href="https://jsfiddle.net/hj2w7wwa/9/">!Testcase</a>

						<li>An anonymous <a>table-wrapper</a> box must be generated around each <a>table-root</a>.
							Its display type is <code>inline-block</code> for <a>inline-table</a> boxes and block for <a>table</a> boxes.
							The table wrapper box establishes a block formatting context.
							The table-root box (not the table-wrapper box) is used when doing baseline vertical alignment for an <a>inline-table</a>.
							The width of the table-wrapper box is the border-edge width of the table box inside it.
							Percentages which would depend on the 'width' and 'height' on the table-wrapper box's size are relative to the table-wrapper box's containing block instead, not the table-wrapper box itself.

			<div class="note">
				Please note that some layout modes such as flexbox and grid <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#blockify">override the display type</a> of their children.
				These transformations happen before the table fixup.
			</div>

			<div class="note">
				Please note that the 'float' and 'position' properties sometimes <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">affect the computed value</a> of 'display'.

		<h4 id="fixup-boxes">Characteristics of fixup boxes</h4>

			Beside their display type, the anonymous boxes created for fixup purposes
				do not receive any specific or default styling,
				except where otherwise mentioned by this specification.

			<div class="note">

				This means in particular that
					their computed background is “transparent”,
					their computed padding is “0px”,
					their computed border-style is “none”.
					
				It is also woth reminding that an <a>anonymous box</a> inherits property values through the box tree.

			</div>

		<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
		<h4 id="fixup-examples">Examples</h4>

			<div class="example">
				<xmp class="lang-markup">
					<div class="row">
						<div class="cell">George</div>
						<div class="cell">4287</div>
						<div class="cell">1998</div>
					</div>
				</xmp>

				Here is the associated styles:

				<pre class="lang-css">
					.row { display: table-row }
					.cell { display: table-cell }
				</pre>

				After fixup, this will produce layout boxes as though this was the initial HTML:

				<xmp class="lang-markup">
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>George</td>
							<td>4287</td>
							<td>1998</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</xmp>
			</div>

			<div class="example">

				In this example, three <a>table-cell</a> anonymous boxes are assumed to contain the text in the rows. The text inside
				of the divs with a <code>display: table-row</code> are encapsulated in anonymous inline boxes, as explained in
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#anonymous" target="_blank">visual formatting model</a>:

				<xmp class="lang-markup">
					<div class="inline-table">
						<div class="row">This is the top row.</div>
						<div class="row">This is the middle row.</div>
						<div class="row">This is the bottom row.</div>
					</div>
				</xmp>

				<pre class="lang-css">
					.inline-table { display: inline-table; }
					.row { display: table-row; }
				</pre>

				This will produce layout boxes as though this was the initial HTML:

				<xmp class="lang-markup">
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>This is the top row.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>This is the middle row.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>This is the bottom row.</td>
						</tr>
					</table>

	<h3 id="layout-principles">Core layout principles</h3>

		Unlike other block-level boxes, tables do not fill their containing block by default.
		When their 'width' computes to <code>auto</code>, they behave as if they had <code>fit-content</code> specified instead.
		This is different from most block-level boxes, which behave as if they had <code>stretch</code> instead.

		The <dfn id="min-content-width-of-a-table">min-content width of a table</dfn> is
			the width required to fit all of its columns min-content widths and its undistributable spaces.

		The <dfn id="max-content-width-of-a-table">max-content width of a table</dfn> is
			the width required to fit all of its columns max-content widths and its undistributable spaces.

		If the width assigned to a table is larger than its <a href="#min-content-width-of-a-table">min-content width</a>,
			the <a href="#width-distribution">Available Width Distribution</a> algorithm
			will adjust column widths in consequence.

		This section overrides the general-purpose rules that apply to calculating widths described in other specifications.
		In particular, if the margins of a table are set to <code>0</code> and the width to <code>auto</code>,
			the table will not automatically size to fill its containing block.
		However, once the used value of <code>width</code> for the table is found (using the algorithms given below)
			then the other parts of those rules do apply.
		Therefore, a table can be centered using left and right <code>auto</code> margins, for instance.

	<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
	<h3 id="table-layout-algorithm">Table layout algorithm</h3>

		To layout a table, user agents must apply the following actions:

			<ol>
				<li><b>Determine the number of rows/columns the table requires.</b><br/>
					This is done by executing the steps described in [[#dimensioning-the-row-column-grid]].

				<li><b>&lbrack;A&rbrack; If the row/column grid has at least one <a>slot</a>:</b>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Ensure each cell <a>slot</a> is occupied by at least one cell.</b><br/>
							This is done by executing the steps described in [[#missing-cells-fixup]].

						<li><b>Compute the minimum width of each column.</b><br/>
							This is done by executing the steps described in [[#content-measure]].

						<li><b>Compute the width of the table.</b><br/>
							This is done by executing the steps described in [[#computing-the-table-width]].

						<li><b>Distribute the width of the table among columns.</b><br/>
							This is done by executing the steps described in [[#width-distribution-algorithm]].

						<li><b>Compute the height of the table.</b><br/>
							This is done by executing the steps described in [[#computing-the-table-height]].

						<li><b>Distribute the height of the table among rows.</b><br/>

					</ol>

					<b>&lbrack;B&rbrack; Else, an <dfn id="empty-table">empty table</dfn> is laid out:</b>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Compute the width of the table.</b><br/>
							This is done by returning the largest value of <a href="#capmin">CAPMIN</a>
							and the computed width of the table box (including borders and paddings)
								if it is definite (use zero otherwise).

						<li><b>Compute the height of the table.</b><br/>
							This is done by returning the sum of all table-caption heights
								(their width being set to the table width,
								with margins taken into consideration appropriately)
							and the computed height of the table box (including borders and paddings)
								if it is definite (use zero otherwise).

					</ol>

				<li><b>Assign to each table-caption and table-cell their position and size.</b><br/>
					This is done by running the steps of [[#bounding-box-assignment]].

	<h3 id="dimensioning-the-row-column-grid">Dimensioning the row/column grid</h3>

		Like mentioned in the <a href="#table-structure">Table structure</a> section,
			how many rows and columns a table has
			can be determined from the table structure.
		Both dimensioning the row/column <a>grid</a> and assigning table-cells their <nobr><a>slot</a>(s)</nobr> in that grid
			do require running the HTML Algorithms for tables.

		<h4 id="dimensioning-the-row-column-grid--step1">HTML Algorithm</h4>
		<p class="note">
			CSS Boxes that do not originate from an HTML table element equivalent to their display type
				need to be converted to their HTML equivalent before we can apply this algorithm, see below.
			There is no way to specify the <a>span</a> of a cell in css only in this level of the spec,
				the use of an HTML td element is required to do so.

		Apply the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/tabular-data.html#forming-a-table">HTML5 Table Formatting algorithm</a>,
			where boxes act like <a href="#display-types">the HTML element equivalent to their display type</a>,
			and use the attributes of their originating element if and only if it is an HTML element of the same type
			(otherwise, they act like if they didnt't have any attribute).

		<div class="example">
			<xmp class="lang-markup">
				<ul class="table">
					<li><b>One</b><i>1</i></li>
					<li><b>Two</b><i>2</i></li>
					<li><b>Three</b><i>3</i></li>
				</ul>
				<style>
					ul.table { display: table; }
					ul.table > li { display: table-row; }
					ul.table > li > * { display: table-cell; }
				</style>
			</xmp>
			produces the same row/column grid as
			<xmp class="lang-markup">
				<table><tbody>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</xmp>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<pre class="lang-markup" style="margin-bottom:0;padding-bottom:0;">
				&lt;!-- built using dom api, as this would be fixed by the html parser --&gt;
			</pre>
			<xmp class="lang-markup" style="margin-top:0;padding-top:0;">

			Note how the second cell of the first row doesn't have ```colspan=2``` applied, because its originating element is not an HTML TD element.

		<h4 id="dimensioning-the-row-column-grid--step2">Track merging</h4>
		<p class="note">
			The HTML Table Formatting algorithm sometimes generates more tracks than necessary to layout the table properly.
			Those tracks have historically been ignored by user agents,
			so the next step just gets rid of them entirely to avoid dealing with them as exceptions later in the spec.
			We have tried to maintain the functionality with this change, but if you happen to find any issues
			due to this change please file an issue.

		Modify iteratively the obtained grid by merging consecutive tracks as follows:
		As long as there exists an <a>eligible track</a> in the obtained row/column grid such that
			there is no table-column/table-row box defining the said track explicitly, and
			both the said track and the previous one are spanned by the exact same set of cells,
			those two tracks must be merged into one single track for the purpose of computing the layout of the table.
		Reduce the <a>span</a> of the cells that spanned the deleted track by one to compensate,
			and shift similarly the tracks from which cells <a>originate</a> when needed.
		<span class="hint">(see <a href="#spanning-ghost-rows">spanning-ghost-rows test cases</a>)</span>

		For tables <a>in auto mode</a>, every track is an <dfn>eligible track</dfn> for the purpose of the track-merging algorithm.
		For tables <a>in fixed mode</a>, only rows are eligible to be merged that way; which means that every column is preserved.

		Finally, assign to the <a>table-root</a> grid its correct number of rows and columns (from its mapped element),
			and to each <a>table-cell</a> its accurate <a href="#slot">rowStart/colStart/rowSpan/colSpan</a> (from its mapped element).

	<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
	<h3 id="missing-cells-fixup">Missing cells fixup</h3>

		<p class=note>
			The following section clarifies and extends the CSS 2.1 statement saying that
				missing cells are rendered as if an anonymous table-cell box occupied their position in the grid
				(a "missing cell" is a slot in the row/column grid that is not covered yet by any table-cell box).

		Once the amount of columns in a table is known, any table-row box must be modified such that
			it owns enough cells to fill all the columns of the table, when taking <a>spans</a> into account.
		New table-cell <a href="#fixup-boxes">anonymous boxes</a> must be appended to its rows content until this condition is met.

	<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
	<h3 id="layout-modes">Table layout modes</h3>

		This section covers the flags which modify the way tables are being laid out.
		There are three major flags for table layout: 'table-layout', 'border-collapse', and 'caption-side'.
		The 'border-collapse' flag has an optional 'border-spacing' parameter.

		<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
		<h4 id="table-layout-property">The Table-Layout property</h4>

			<pre class='propdef'>
				Name: table-layout
				Value: auto | fixed
				Initial: auto
				Applies To: table-root boxes.
				Inherited: yes
			</pre>

			A table-root is said to be laid out <dfn>in fixed mode</dfn>
				whenever the computed value of the 'table-layout' property is equal to <code>fixed</code>,
				and the specified width of the table root is either
					a <code>&lt;length-percentage&gt</code>,
					<code>min-content</code> or
					<code>fit-content</code>.
			When the specified width is not one of those values,
				or if the computed value of the 'table-layout' property is <code>auto</code>,
				then the table-root is said to be laid out <dfn>in auto mode</dfn>.

			When a table-root is laid out <a>in fixed mode</a>,
			the content of its table-cells is ignored for the purpose of width computation,
			the aggregation algorithm for column sizing considers only table-cells belonging to the first row track,
			such that layout only depends on the values explicitly specified for the table-columns or cells of the first row of the table;
			columns with indefinite widths are attributed their fair share of the remaining space
			after the columns with a definite width have been considered, or 0px if there is no remaining space
			(see [[#computing-column-measures]]).

		<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
		<h4 id="border-collapse-property">The Border-Collapse property</h4>

			<pre class='propdef'>
				Name: border-collapse
				Value: separate | collapse
				Initial: separate
				Applies To: table-root boxes.
				Inherited: yes
			</pre>

			When the 'border-collapse' property has <code>collapse</code> as its value,
			the borders of adjacent cells are merged together such that each cell draws only half of the shared border.
			As a result, some other properties like 'border-spacing' will not applied in this case (see [[#collapsed-style-overrides]]),
			(see [[#border-collapsing]]).

			A <a>table-root</a> is said to be laid out <dfn>in collapsed-borders mode</dfn> in this case.
			Otherwhise, the <a>table-root</a> is said to be laid out <dfn>in separated-borders mode</dfn>.

			<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
			<h5 id="border-spacing-property">The Border-Spacing property</h5>

			<pre class='propdef'>
				Name: border-spacing
				Value: <​length​>{1,2}
				Initial: 0px 0px
				Applies To: table-root boxes when 'border-collapse' is <code>separate</code>.
				Inherited: yes
				Computed Value: two absolute lengths
				Media: visual
				Animatable: yes
			</pre>

			The lengths specify the distance that separates adjoining cell borders <a>in separated-borders mode</a>,
				and must not be strictly negative.

			If one length is specified, it gives both the horizontal and vertical spacing.
			If two are specified, the first gives the horizontal spacing and the second the vertical spacing.

			See [[#computing-undistributable-space]] for details on how this affects the table layout.


		<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
		<h4 id="caption-side-property">The Caption-Side property</h4>

			<pre class='propdef'>
				Name: caption-side
				Value: top | bottom
				Initial: top
				Applies to: <code>table-caption</code> boxes
				Inherited: yes
				Media: visual
			</pre>

			This property specifies the position of the caption box with respect to the table box.
			Values have the following meanings:

			<dl>
				<dt><dfn id="caption-side-top">top</dfn>
				<dd>
					Positions the caption box above the table box.

				<dt><dfn id="caption-side-bottom">bottom</dfn>
				<dd>
					Positions the caption box below the table box.
			</dl>

			<div class="note">
				CSS2 described a different width and horizontal alignment behavior.
				That behavior was supposed to be introduced in CSS3
					using the values <code>top-outside</code> and <code>bottom-outside</code>.
				<a href="http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/discuss/captions/">#REF</a>
			</div>

			<div class="note">
				Gecko also supports the "left" and "right" values, but currently this specification
				is not attempting to define their implementation of said values.
			</div>

			<div classs="note">
				Gecko has a bug when dealing with multiple captions.
				<a class="hint" href="http://codepen.io/FremyCompany/pen/WrJxwP">!Testcase</a>
			</div>

			<div class="example">

				To align caption content horizontally within the caption box, use the 'text-align' property.

				In this example, the 'caption-side' property places captions below tables.
				The caption will be as wide as the parent of the table, and caption text will be left-justified.

				<pre>
					caption {
						caption-side: bottom;

		The following sections list the exceptions and their effects.

		<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
		<h4 id="global-style-overrides">Overrides applying in all modes</h4>

			The following rules apply to all tables, irrespective of the layout mode in use.

			<ul>

				<li>The computed values of properties 'position', 'float', 'margin'-*, 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left' on the table box
						are used on the table-wrapper box and not the table box;
					the same holds true for the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#grouping-property-values">properties whose use could force the used value of <object>'transform-style'</object> to <code>flat</code></a> and their shorthands/longhands relatives:
						this list currently includes 'overflow', 'opacity', 'filter', 'clip', 'clip-path', 'isolation', 'mask'-*, 'mix-blend-mode', 'transform'-* and 'perspective'.
					<br>
					Where the table box values are not used on the table and/or table wrapper boxes,
						the unset values are used instead for that box (inherit or initial, depending on the property).

				<li>The 'overflow' property on the <a>table-root</a> and <a>table-wrapper</a> box, when its value is not either <code>visible</code> or <code>hidden</code>,
					is ignored and treated as if its value was <code>visible</code>.

				<li>All css properties of <a>table-column</a> and <a>table-column-group</a> boxes are ignored,
					except when explicitly specified by this specification.

				<li>The 'position' of <a>table-track</a> and <a>table-track-group</a> boxes is ignored
					if its value is <code>relative</code>. User agents that support 'transform'
					still need to support making these boxes containing blocks if required by spec.

				<li>The 'margin', 'padding', 'overflow' and 'z-index' of <a>table-track</a> and <a>table-track-group</a boxes> are ignored.

				<li>The 'margin' of <a>table-cell</a> boxes is ignored (as if it was set to 0px).

				<li>The 'background' of <a>table-cell</a> boxes
					are painted using a special background painting algorithm described in [[#drawing-cell-backgrounds]].

			</ul>


		<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
		<h4 id="collapsed-style-overrides">Overrides applying in collapsed-borders mode</h4>

			When a table is laid out <a>in collapsed-borders mode</a>, the following rules apply:

			<ul>
				<li>The 'padding' of the <a>table-root</a> is ignored (as if it was set to 0px).

				<li>The 'border-spacing' of the <a>table-root</a> is ignored (as if it was set to 0px).

				<li>The 'border-radius' of both <a>table-root</a> and <a>table-non-root</a> boxes
					is ignored (as it it was set to 0px).
				<li>The values used for the layout and rendering of the borders of the <a>table-root</a>
						and the <a>table-cell</a> boxes it owns are
						determined using a special conflict resolution algorithm described in [[#border-collapsing]].

	<h3 id="border-collapsing">Border-collapsing</h3>

		<div class="note">

			This entire section is a proposal to make the rendering of collapsed borders sane.
			As implementations diverge very visibly, it is expected to require more discussion than some other parts.
			Since browsers handle this so differently, convergence cannot happen without reimplementation.
			A major concern for this proposal was to support as many cases as possible, and yet
				keep the effort required for a new implementation of tables as low as possible.

			<b>Background:</b>
			CSS+HTML allow unprecedented combinations of border modes for table junctions,
				and it makes it difficult to support all cases properly;
				in fact some combinations are not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-posed_problem">well-posed problems</a>,
				so no rendering algorithm could be optimal.

			Because they grew from something simple (HTML) to something very complex (HTML+CSS),
				the current table rendering models (backgrounds and borders) used by web browsers are insane
				(in the sense they are buggy, not interoperable and not CSSish at all).
			Many usual CSS assumptions are broken, and renderings diverge widely.

			Before deciding on the final width of all columns,

			<p class="note">
				As noted before, this would usually be the sum of preferred width of all columns, plus any extra.
				In this case, the width distribution will result in giving each column its preferred width.
				There are however a few cases where the author asks for some other width explicitly,
					as well as a few cases where the table cannot be given the width it requires.

			<p style="font-style: italic">
				This section is not normative.

			<h5 id="width-distribution-principles-rN">Rules</h5>

			Ideally, each column should get its preferred width (usually its <a>max-content width</a>).
			However, the <a>assignable table width</a> calculated before
				could be either too big or too small to achieve this result,
				in which case the user agent must assign adhoc widths to columns
				as described in the width distribution algorithm.

			This algorithm follows three rules when determining a column's used width:

			<p id="width-distribution-principles-r0">
				<b>Rule 0: </b>
				<span>
					<a>In fixed mode</a>,
					auto and percentages columns are assigned a minimum width of zero pixels, and
					percentage resolution follows a different set of rules,
					whose goal is to ensure pixel columns always get assigned their preferred width.
				</span>

			<p id="width-distribution-principles-r1">
				<b>Rule 1: </b>
				<span>
					When assigning preferred widths,
					specified percent columns have a higher priority
					than specified unit value columns, which have a higher priority
					than auto columns.
				</span>

			<p id="width-distribution-principles-r2">
				<b>Rule 2: </b>
				<span>
					Columns using the same <a>sizing type</a> (percent columns, pixel columns, or auto columns) follow the same distribution method.
					For example, they all get their <a>min-content width</a> or they all get their <a>max-content width</a>.
					<br/>
					<span class="note" style="display: block; margin-top: 0.5em">
						There is one exception to this rule.
						When giving its preferred percent width to a percent-column,
							if that would result in a size smaller than its <a>min-content width</a>,
							the column will be assigned its <a>min-content width</a> instead
							though the percent-columns group as a whole is still regarded
							as being assigned the preferred percent widths.
					</span>
				</span>

			<p id="width-distribution-principles-r3">
				<b>Rule 3: </b>
				<span>
					The sum of width assgined to all columns should be equal to the <a>assignable table width</a>.

				- <dfn>percent-column</dfn>:<br>
					a column whose any constraint is defined to use a percentage only (with a value different from 0%)
				- <dfn>pixel-column</dfn>:<br>
					column whose any constraint is defined to use a defined length only (and is not a percent-column)
				- <dfn>auto-column</dfn>:<br>
					any other column

			Then, valid sizing methods are to be assigned to the columns by sizing type, yielding the following guesses:

			<ol>
				<li>The <dfn>min-content guess</dfn> is the set of column width assignments where
					each column is assigned its min-content width.

				<li>The <dfn>min-content-percentage guess</dfn> is the set of column width assignments where:
					<ul>
						<li>each <a>percent-column</a>
							is assigned the larger of:
							<ul>
								<li>its intrinsic percentage width times the assignable width and
								<li>its min-content width.
							</ul>

						<li>all other columns are assigned their min-content width.
					</ul>

				<li>The <dfn>min-content-specified guess</dfn> is the set of column width assignments where:
					<ul>
						<li>each <a>percent-column</a>
							is assigned the larger of:
							<ul>
								<li>its intrinsic percentage width times the assignable width and
								<li>its min-content width
							</ul>

						<li>any other column that is constrained
							is assigned its max-content width

						<li>all other columns are assigned their min-content width.
					</ul>

				<li>The <dfn>max-content guess</dfn> is the set of column width assignments where:
					<ul>
						<li>each <a>percent-column</a>
							is assigned the larger of:
							<ul>
								<li>its intrinsic percentage width times the assignable width and
								<li>its min-content width
							</ul>

						<li>all other columns are assigned their max-content width.
					</ul>
			</ol>

			<div class="note">
				Note that:

				- The <a>assignable table width</a> is always greater than or equal
					to the table width resulting from the min-content guess.
				- The widths for each column in the four guesses
					(min-content guess, min-content-percentage guess, min-content-specified guess, and max-content guess)
					are in nondecreasing order.

			</div>

			If the <a>assignable table width</a> is less than or equal to the <a>max-content guess</a>,
				the used widths of the columns must be the linear combination (with weights adding to 1)
				of the two consecutive guesses whose width sums bound the available width.

			Otherwise, the used widths of the columns are the result of starting from the <a>max-content guess</a>
				and distributing the excess width to the columns of the table
				according to the rules for <a>distributing excess width to columns</a> (for used width).

		<h5 id="width-distribution-in-fixed-mode">Changes to width distribution in fixed mode</h5>

			The following changes to previous algorithm apply <a>in fixed mode</a>:

				- The minimum width of percent-columns and auto-columns is considered to be zero

				- Cells ignore their border and padding size if their width is a percentage ('box-sizing' is ignored)

				- If, when percentages are resolved based on the <a>assignable table width</a>,
					the sum of columns widths based on this resolution would exceed the assignable table width,
					they are instead to be resolved relative to their percentage value such that
					the sum of columns width meets the assignable table width exactly.

				- Columns whose size is computed as a sum of a percentage and a pixel length must be sized as if they counted as two columns,
					one with the pixel value, the other with the percentage value.


		<h5 id="distributing-width-to-columns">Distributing excess width to columns</h5>

		The rules for <dfn>distributing excess width to columns</dfn> can be invoked in two ways:

		<ul>
			<li>for distributing the excess width of a table to its columns
				during the computation of the used widths of those columns (for used width calculation), or

			<li>for distributing the excess max-content or min-content width of a cell spanning more than one column
				to the max-content or min-content widths of the columns it spans (for intrinsic width calculation).
		</ul>

		The rules for these two cases are largely the same, but there are slight differences.

		The remainder of this section uses the term <dfn>distributed width</dfn> to refer to the one of these widths that is being distributed,
		and the <dfn>excess width</dfn> is used to refer to the amount by which the width being distributed
		exceeds the sum of the distributed widths of the columns it is being distributed to.

		<ol>

			<li>If there are non-constrained columns that have originating cells
					with intrinsic percentage width of 0% and
					with nonzero max-content width
					<i class="hint">(aka the columns allowed to grow by this rule)</i>,
				the distributed widths of the columns allowed to grow by this rule
					are increased in proportion to max-content width
					so the total increase adds to the excess width.

			<li>Otherwise, if there are non-constrained columns that have originating cells
					with intrinsic percentage width of 0%
					<i class="hint">(aka the columns allowed to grow by this rule,
					which thanks to the previous rule must have zero max-content width)</i>,
				the distributed widths of the columns allowed to grow by this rule
					are increased by equal amounts
					so the total increase adds to the excess width.

			<li>Otherwise, if there are (constrained) columns
					with intrinsic percentage width of 0% and
					with nonzero max-content width
					<i class="hint">(aka the columns allowed to grow by this rule, which, due to other rules, must have originating cells)</i>,
				the distributed widths of the columns allowed to grow by this rule
					are increased in proportion to max-content width
					so the total increase adds to the excess width.

			<li>Otherwise, if there are columns
					with intrinsic percentage width greater than 0%
					<i class="hint">(aka the columns allowed to grow by this rule, which, due to other rules, must have originating cells)</i>,
				the distributed widths of the columns allowed to grow by this rule
					are increased in proportion to intrinsic percentage width
					so the total increase adds to the excess width.

			<li>Otherwise, if there is any such column,
					the distributed widths of all columns that have originating cells
					are increased by equal amounts
					so the total increase adds to the excess width.

			<li>Otherwise,
					the distributed widths of all columns
					are increased by equal amounts
					so the total increase adds to the excess width.
		</ol>

		<div class="advisement">
			These rules do not apply when the table is laid out <a>in fixed mode</a>.
			In this case, the simpler rules that follow apply instead:
			<ul><li>If there are any columns with no width specified, the excess width is distributed in equally to such columns
				<li>otherwise, if there are columns with non-zero length widths from the base assignment, the excess width is distributed proportionally to width among those columns
				<li>otherwise, if there are columns with non-zero percentage widths from the base assignment, the excess width is distributed proportionally to percentage width among those columns
				<li>otherwise, the excess width is distributed equally to the zero-sized columns</ul>

			The <strong>height of a table</strong> is the sum of the row heights plus any cell spacing or borders.
			If the table has a 'height' property with a value other than auto, it is treated as a minimum height for the table grid,
				and will eventually be distributed to the height of the rows.

			The <strong>minimum height of a row</strong> is the maximum of:
			<ul><li>the computed 'height' (if definite, percentages being considered 0px) of its corresponding table-row (if nay)
				<li>the computed 'height' of each cell spanning the current row exclusively (if definite, percentages being treated as 0px), and
				<li>the minimum height (<a>ROWMIN</a>) required by the cells spanning the row.</ul>

			<dfn id="ROWMIN">ROWMIN</dfn> is defined as the sum of the <a href="#TODO">minimum height of the rows</a>
					after a first row layout pass.

			Once the table height has been determined, a second row layout pass must happen
					to assign the correct minimum height to table rows, by taking percentages used in rows/cells specified 'height' into account.

			Then, if the sum of the new heights of the table rows after this second pass
			is different from what is needed to fill the table height,
				the height distribution algorithm defined <a href="#height-distribution-algorithm">below</a> is applied
				(either to size rows intermediately between their first minimum height and their new,
				or to increase the heights of rows beyond their new minimum height;
				in neither case, this will have an impact on the baseline of the rows).

			<div class="advisement">

				Once the final size of the table and the rows has been determined,
					the content of the table-cells must also go through a second layout pass,
					where, if appropriate, percentage-based heights are this time resolved
					against their parent cell used height.

				It is appropriate to resolve percentage heights on direct children of a table-cell
					if the cell is considered to have its height specified explicitly
					or the child is absolutely positioned, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#the-height-property">CSS 2</a>.

				It is further clarified that
					a cell is considered to have its height specified explicitly
					if the computed height of the cell or any of its table ancestors is a length or percentage,
					and that percentage does not <a>behave as auto</a>.

			</div>

			<div class="note">
				It is possible that this second layout pass (where height percentages are being resolved)
					will make some cell contents overflow their parent cell. This is by design.
			</div>

		<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
		<h4 id="row-layout">Row layout</h3>

			The <strong>minimum height of a row</strong> (without spanning-related height distribution)
				is defined as the height of
				an hypothetical linebox containing the cells originating in the row
				and where cells spanning multiple rows are considered having a height of 0px
				(but their correct baseline).
			In this hypothetical linebox, cell heights are considered auto,
				but their other properties are conserved.

			For the purpose of calculating this height,
				descendants of table cells whose height depends on percentages of their parent cell' height
				are considered to have an auto height
					if they have 'overflow' set to <code>visible</code> or <code>hidden</code>
					or if they are replaced elements,
				and a 0px height if they have not.

			The <dnf id="table-cell-baseline">baseline of a cell</dfn> is defined as
				the baseline of the first in-flow line box in the cell, or
				the first in-flow table-row in the cell,
				whichever comes first.
			If there is no such line box or table-row,
				the baseline is the bottom of content edge of the cell box.

			</div>

			<p class="advisement">
				For the purposes of finding a baseline,
					in-flow boxes with a scrolling mechanisms (see the 'overflow' property)
					must be considered as if scrolled to their origin position.

			<p class="note">
				The baseline of a cell may end up below its bottom border,
					see the example below.

			<div class="example">

				The cell in this example has a baseline below its bottom border:

					<tr>
					<td>
					<div> Test </div>
					</td>
					</tr>
					</table>
				</xmp>
			</div>

			The 'vertical-align' property of each table cell determines its alignment within the row.
			Each cell's content has a baseline, a top, a middle, and a bottom, as does the row itself.

			In the context of table cells, values for 'vertical-align' have the following meanings:

			<table class="def">
				<tr>
					<th valign=top>baseline</th>
					<td>The baseline of the cell is aligned with the baseline of the other cells of the first row it spans (see the definition of baselines of <a href="#table-cell-baseline">cells</a> and <a href="#table-row-baseline">rows</a>).</td>
				<tr>
					<th valign=top>top</th>
					<td>The top of the cell box is aligned with the top of the first row it spans.</td>
				<tr>
					<th valign=top>bottom</th>
					<td>The bottom of the cell box is aligned with the bottom of the last row it spans.</td>
				<tr>
					<th valign=top>middle</th>
					<td>The center of the cell is aligned with the center of the rows it spans.</td>
				<tr>
					<th valign=top title="sub, super, text-top, text-bottom, &lt;length>, &lt;percentage>">...</th>
					<td>Other values do not apply to cells; the cell is aligned at the baseline instead.</td>
			</table>

			The maximum distance between
				the top of the cell box
				and the baseline over all cells that have 'vertical-align: baseline'
				is used to set the <dfn id="table-row-baseline">baseline of the row</dfn>.
			If a row doesn't have any cell that has 'vertical-align: baseline',
				the baseline of that row is the bottom content edge of the lowest cell in the row.

			The <dfn id="table-root-baseline">baseline of a table-root</dfn> is the baseline of its first row, if any.
				Otherwise, it is the bottom content edge of the table-root.

			<a class="hint" href="https://wptest.center/#/mz09g6">Testcase</a>
			<a class="hint" href="https://wptest.center/#/x80356">!!Testcase</a>

			<div class="advisement">

				To avoid ambiguous situations,
				the alignment of cells proceeds in the following order:

				<ul><li>First the cells that are aligned on their baseline are positioned.
						This will establish the baseline of the row.
					<li>Next the cells with 'vertical-align: top' are positioned.
						The row now has a top, possibly a baseline, and a provisional height,
							which is the distance from the top to the lowest bottom of the cells positioned so far.
					<li>If any of the remaining cells, those aligned at the bottom or the middle,

			Since during row layout the specified heights of cells in the row were ignored
				and cells that were spanning more than one rows have not been sized correctly,
				their height will need to be eventually distributed to the set of rows they spanned.
			This is done by running the same algorithm as the column measurement for spans N>1,
				with the span=1 value being initialized (for min-content) with the largest of
				the resulting height of the previous row layout,
				the height specified on the corresponding table-row (if any),
				and the largest height specified on cells that span this row only.

				At this point, cell boxes that are smaller than the collective height of the rows they span

					Investigations on height distribution
				</summary>
				<aside>

					Initial analysis shows that there are indeed similarities between width and height distribution.
					There are also differences which I described here below:

					In many case, all browsers apply a distribution algorithm that favors percentages over pixels over auto.
					<span class="hint"><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/xg2ss965/2/">Case 6</a></span>.

					A difference with the width distribution algorithm is that
						if the sum of all rows' heights is higher than 100%,
						then all browsers enter a completely different mode.
						<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/6ec0hxgx/">Case 7</a>.
						<span class="hint">
							NOTE: The sum counts as well percentage heights and pixels heights,
							since at this point you can safely resolve percentages.
						</span>
						<br/>

					In this case, pixel-tracks are sized properly first.
					Then, percentage tracks get the remaining space proportionally to their height percentage up to their height percentage.
					Finally, auto tracks get to fill the remaining space, if there is any auto track.
					If there is none, percentage tracks continue growing above their height percentage until all the space is filled.
					<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/xg2ss965/1/">Case 9</a>.

					The height distribution algorithm also caps the sum of percentage heights to 100% in all browsers but Edge.
					That means that some rows get an arbitrary 0% height.
					<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/xg2ss965/">Case 8</a>.

					In Edge and Firefox, empty tracks do not get an increased size by this distribution if there are filled auto tracks.
					In Chrome, empty tracks count as distributable tracks as well even if there are other auto tracks.

			The first step is to attribute to each row its base size and its reference size.

			Its <strong>base size</strong> is the size it would have got
				if the table didn’t have a specified height
				(the one it was assigned when ROWMIN was evaluated).

			Its <strong>reference size</strong> is the largest of
			<ul><li>its initial base height and
				<li>its new base height
					(the one evaluated during the second layout pass,
					where percentages used in rowgroups/rows/cells' specified heights
					were resolved according to the table height,
					instead of being ignored as 0px).</ul>

			The second step is to compute the final height of each row based on those sizes.

			If the table height is equal or smaller than sum of reference sizes,
				the final height assigned to each row will be
				the weighted mean of the base and the reference size
				that yields the correct total height.

			Else, if the table owns any “auto-height” row
				(a row whose size is only determined by its content size and none of the specified heights),
				each non-auto-height row receives its reference height
				and auto-height rows receive their reference size plus some increment
				which is equal to the height missing to amount to the specified table height
				divided by the amount of such rows.

			Else, all rows receive their reference size plus some increment
				which is equal to the height missing to amount to the specified table height
				divided by the amount of rows.

<h3 id="static-position">
With a table-internal box as non-containing block parent</h3>

	The only influence of non-containing block parent of an absolutely-positioned box is to define its static position,
	in case both top+bottom and/or left+right end up being auto.

	For table-cells, the absolutely-positioned content is positioned follows the rules for block layout as usual.

	Due to <a href="#fixup">table fixup</a>, 
	it is not possible to create an absolutely-positioned box 
	that is the child of a table-internal box that is not a table-cell 
	(see note about float and position for more details).

		<h5 id="drawing-collapsed-borders-1">Changes in collapsed-borders mode</h3>

			When a table is laid out <a>in collapsed-borders mode</a>,
				the rendering of its borders on and those of its table-cells is modified.
			The following rules describe in which way.

			<p cass="note">
				The rules for background and borders painting defined in [[#drawing-backgrounds-and-borders]]
					still apply if they are not overriden.

			Borders of a non-<a href="#empty-table">empty</a> <a>table-root</a> are not painted <a>in collapsed-borders mode</a>,
				except if the 'border-image' property is set.

			In this latter case, the border is drawn as if the table border was twice as big as its used value specify,
				and as if that excess was rendered inside the padding area of the <a>table-root</a>.

			<p class="note">
				Even if they are not drawn by the table, the table borders still occupy their space in the layout.
					Cells will <a href="#drawing-cell-borders">render those shared borders</a>.

			<p class="advisement">
				Anonymous table-cells added by the <a href="#missing-cells-fixup">missing cells fixup</a> step
					do not render any of their backgrounds.

			In addition to its own 'background', <a>table-cell</a> boxes also
				render the backgrounds of the <a>table-track</a> and <a>table-track-group</a> boxes in which they belong.
			This is actually different from simply inheriting their background
				because the 'background-origin' and 'background-size' computations will actually be done
				on the bounds of the grouping boxes, and not on those of the cell.

			For the purposes of finding the background of each table cell,
				the different table boxes may be thought of as being on six superimposed layers.
			The background set in one of the layers will only be visible
				if the layers above it have a transparent background.

			<figure>

				<figcaption>Schema of table layers.</figcaption>
			</figure></p>

			<ol start="0">
				<li>The table background is being rendered by the table,
					and does not affect the cell background.

				<li>The first background drawn by a cell is the background of its originating column group.
					For the purpose of background-positioning,
						it is expected that a column group occupies
						the largest possible area a single cell could occupy in the row/column grid
						while originating in the column group and not entering any column not part of the column group.

				<li>The second background drawn by a cell is the background of its originating column.
					For the purpose of background-positioning,
						it is expected that a column occupies
						the largest possible area a single cell could occupy in the row/column grid
						while originating in the column and not entering any other column.

				<li>The third background drawn by a cell is the background of its originating row group.
					For the purpose of background-positioning,
						it is expected that a row group occupies
						the largest possible area a single cell could occupy in the row/column grid
						while originating in the row group and not entering any row not part of the row group.

				<li>The fourth background drawn by a cell is the background of its originating row.
					For the purpose of background-positioning,
						it is expected that a row occupies
						the largest possible area a single cell could occupy in the row/column grid
						while originating in the row and not entering any other row.

				<li>The fifth background drawn by a cell is its own background.
					This is the one that appears on top once all backgrounds have been rendered.
			</ol>

			As the figure above shows, although all rows contain the same number of cells,
				not every cell may have specified content.
			<a>In separated-borders mode</a>, if the value of their 'empty-cells' property is <code>hide</code>,
				these <a>empty cells</a> are not rendered at all,
				as if <code>visibility: hidden</code> was specified on them,
				letting the table background show through.

			In separated-borders mode, borders of table cells are rendered as usual.

			<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
			<h5 id="drawing-collapsed-borders-2">Changes in collapsed-borders mode</h3>

			Borders of a <a>table-cell</a> are rendered <a>in collapsed-borders mode</a>
				as if the cell border was twice as big as its used value specify,
				and as if that excess was rendered in the margin area of the cell,
				with the added constraint that
					for each side of the border which isn’t located at one of the table edges,
					the border is actually clipped to the border-box drawing area as its real used value define
					except if the 'border-image' property is set.

			If applying the previously-mentioned clipping behavior results in clipping a border over a non-integer amount of device pixels,
				browsers may decide to snap the clipping area to a device pixel instead by ceiling the x- and y-values of the clipping area.
			Ceiling the values ensures that in a normal writing mode,
				the cell which gets the contested pixels between multiple cells is actually the most top left one,
				which has a greater specificity than the other ones according to this spec.
				<span class="hint">See [[#paint-order]] and [[#border-conflict-resolution-algorithm]].</span>

		<h4 id="border-style-overrides">Border styles (collapsed-borders mode)</h4>

			Some of the values of the 'border-style' have different meanings for tables <a>in collapsed-borders mode</a> than usual.

			then the footer must come directly after the last row in the fragmentainer
			and the vertical gap must be inserted after the repeated footer.

	<!--——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-->
	<h3 id="repeated-headers">Repeating headers across pages</h3>

		When rendering the document into a paged media,
			user agents must repeat
				<a href="#table-header-group">header rows</a> and
				<a href="#table-footer-group">footer rows</a>
			on each page spanned by a table
			if the page is the table's fragmentainer,
			if the header/footer has avoid 'break-inside' applied to it,
			if the height required to do so is inferior to
				two quarters of the page height
				(up to one quarter for header rows, and
				up to one quarter for footer rows), and
			if that doesn't cause a row to be displayed twice
				on that page.

		When the header rows are being repeated, user agents must
			leave room and if needed render the table top border.
		The same applies for footer rows and the table bottom border.

			<figcaption>Expected rendering of table with headers and footers fragmented across two pages</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p class="advisement">
			User agents may decide to extend this behavior to more fragmentation contexts,
				for instance repeat headers/rows across columns in addition to pages.
			User-agents that are rendering static documents are more likely to adopt this behavior,
				though this is not required per spec.
