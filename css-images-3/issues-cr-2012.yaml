      Despite what Tab seems to be implying in the comment there, what he
      actually did was restrict color stops to two colors. Either way, he
      resolved the issue.

      **Main issues:**


      1. Angle interpolation results in wonkiness because the gradient line
      shrinks and grows during the animation. Also see [issue 9 in the
      spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-images-3/#issue-72cb0197).

      2. Keywords in angles do not resolve to a predefined angle.
