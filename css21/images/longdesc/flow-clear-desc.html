      <h1>Long description of example illustrating floating without
clear</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates the effects of floating a box ("inner")
and how its "sibling" flows alongside it.

<P>A document window is shown, with 8 lines (numbered 1 to 8), each
24px high. Since the "inner" box has been floated to the right,
all other text flows around it, including that of the "sibling"
box (on lines 1 through 5).

<P>In the following PRE element, each 24 pixel line is simulated by
two lines, the second beginning with the appropriate number. 
Vertical bars represent the left edge of the floated box.
The lines, as they appear in the image, contain:</p>

<PRE>

1 Beginning of body contents. Start 

2 of outer contents.     | Inner

3 Sibling contents. End  | contents.

4 of outer contents. End of body
 
5 contents.
</PRE>

<P>The default text color is black.
"Start of outer contents" is red.
"Sibling contents" is red.
"Inner contents" is blue.
"End of outer contents" is red.
