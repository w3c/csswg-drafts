# Introduction # {#intro}

This spec describes the CSS and JS mechanics of the single-page transition API.

# Transitions as an enhancement # {#transitions-as-enhancements}

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

A key part of this API design is the view that an animated transition is an enhancement to a DOM change.

If a transition cannot run, or is skipped, the DOM change should still happen. If the DOM change should also be skipped, then that should be handled by another feature. The <a href="https://wicg.github.io/navigation-api/#navigate-event-class">`signal` on `NavigateEvent`</a> is an example of a feature developers could use to handle this.

Although the transition API allows DOM changes to be asynchronous via the {{DOMTransitionInit/updateDOM}} callback, the transition API is not responsible for queuing or otherwise scheduling the DOM changes, beyond the scheduling needed for the transition itself. Some asynchronous DOM changes can happen concurrently (e.g if they're happening within independent components), whereas others need to queue, or abort an earlier change. This is best left to a feature or framework that has a more holistic view of the update.

# CSS properties # {#css-properties}

## 'page-transition-tag' ## {#page-transition-tag-prop}

<pre class=propdef>
Name: page-transition-tag
Value: none | <<custom-ident>>
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Percentages: n/a
Computed Value: as specified
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

The 'page-transition-tag' property "tags" an element
as participating in a page transition.

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=page-transition-tag>
    : <dfn>none</dfn>
    :: The element will not participate in a page transition.

    : <dfn><<custom-ident>></dfn>
    :: The element can participate in a page transition,
        as either an outgoing or incoming element,
        with a <dfn dfn for>page transition tag</dfn>
        equal to the <<custom-ident>>'s value.

        The value <css>none</css>
        is invalid as a <<custom-ident>>.
</dl>

The root element participates in a page transition by default using
the following style in the [=user-agent origin=].

<pre><code highlight=css>
    html {
      page-transition-tag: root;
    }
 </code></pre>

# Pseudo-elements # {#pseudo}

While the UA is [=animating a page transition=],
it creates the following <dfn export>page-transition pseudo-elements</dfn>,
to represent the various items being animated.

The ''::page-transition'' pseudo-element acts as a grouping element for other
[=page-transition pseudo-elements=] and has the document's root element as its
[=originating element=].

<p class="note">For example, '':root::page-transition'' selector matches this
pseudo-element, but ''div::page-transition'' does not.
</p>

Other [=page-transition pseudo-elements=] take a <<pt-tag-selector>> argument
to specify which elements tagged with ''page-transition-tag'' are affected.

There can be multiple pseudo-elements of the same type,
one for each ''page-transition-tag'' participating in a transition.

The <<pt-tag-selector>> is defined as follows:

<pre class=prod>
    <dfn>&lt;pt-tag-selector></dfn> = '*' | <<custom-ident>>
</pre>

A value of ''*'' makes the corresponding selector apply to all pseudo elements
of the specified type. The specificity of a page-transition selector with a
''*'' argument is zero.

The <<custom-ident>> value makes the corresponding selector apply to exactly
one pseudo element of the specified type, namely the pseudo-element that is
created as a result of the ''page-transition-tag'' property on an element with
the same <<custom-ident>> value. The specificity of a page-transition selector
with a <<custom-ident>> argument is the same as for other pseudo-elements, and
is equivalent to a [=type selector=].

The following describes all of the [=page-transition pseudo-elements=] and their function:

: <dfn>::page-transition</dfn>
:: This pseudo-element is the grouping container of all the other
    [=page-transition pseudo-elements=].  Its [=originating element=] is the
    document's root element.

    The following [=user-agent origin=] styles apply to this element:

    <pre><code highlight=css>
    html::page-transition {
      position: fixed;
      inset: 0;
    }
    </code></pre>

    Note: This pseudo-element provides a containing block for all
    ::page-transition-container pseudo-elements. The aim of the style is to
    size the pseudo-element to cover the [=large viewport size=] and position
    all ::page-transition-container pseudo-elements relative to the origin of
    the large viewport.

: <dfn>::page-transition-container( <<pt-tag-selector>> )</dfn>
::  One of these pseudo-elements exists
    for each ''page-transition-tag'' in a page transition,
    and holds the rest of the pseudo-elements corresponding
    to this ''page-transition-tag''.

    Its [=originating element=] is the ''::page-transition''
    pseudo-element.

    The following [=user-agent origin=] styles apply to this element:

    <pre><code highlight=css>
    html::page-transition-container(*) {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;

      animation-duration: 0.25s;
      animation-fill-mode: both;
    }
    </code></pre>

    Note: The aim of the style is to position the element relative to its
    ::page-transition parent.

    In addition to above, styles in the [=user-agent origin=] animate this
    pseudo-element's 'width' and 'height' from the size of the outgoing element's
    [=border box=] to that of the incoming element's [=border box=]. Also the
    element's 'transform' is animated from the outgoing element's screen space
    transform to the incoming element's screen space transform. This style is
    generated dynamically since the values of animated properties are determined
    at the time that the transition begins.

    Issue: The selector for this and subsequently defined pseudo-elements is
    likely to change to indicate position in the pseudo-tree hierarchy.

: <dfn>::page-transition-image-wrapper( <<pt-tag-selector>> )</dfn>
::  One of these pseudo-elements exists
    for each page-transition-tag being in a page transition,
    and holds the images of the outgoing and incoming elements.

    Its [=originating element=] is the ''::page-transition-container()''
    pseudo-element with the same tag.

    The following [=user-agent origin=] styles apply to this element:

    <pre><code highlight=css>
    html::page-transition-image-wrapper(*) {
      position: absolute;
      inset: 0;

      animation-duration: inherit;
      animation-fill-mode: inherit;
    }
    </code></pre>

    In addition to above, styles in the [=user-agent origin=] add ''isolation:
    isolate'' to this pseudo-element if it has both
    ''::page-transition-incoming-image'' and ''::page-transition-outgoing-image'' as
    descendants.

    Note: The aim of the style is to position the element to occupy the same space
    as its ::page-transition-container element and provide isolation for
    blending.

    Issue: Isolation is only necessary to get the right cross-fade between
    incoming and outgoing image pixels. Would it be simpler to always add it
    and try to optimize in the implementation?

: <dfn>::page-transition-outgoing-image( <<pt-tag-selector>> )</dfn>
::  One of these pseudo-elements exists
    for each element in the outgoing DOM being animated by the page transition,
    and is a [=replaced element=] displaying the outgoing element's snapshot image.
    It has [=natural dimensions=] equal to the snapshot's size.

    Its [=originating element=] is the ''::page-transition-image-wrapper()''
    pseudo-element with the same tag.

    The following [=user-agent origin=] styles apply to this element:

    <pre><code highlight=css>
    html::page-transition-outgoing-image(*) {
      position: absolute;
      inset-block-start: 0;
      inline-size: 100%;
      block-size: auto;

      animation-duration: inherit;
      animation-fill-mode: inherit;
    }
    </code></pre>

    Note: The aim of the style is to match the element's inline size while
    retaining the aspect ratio. It is also placed at the block start.

    In addition to above, styles in the [=user-agent origin=] add
    ''mix-blend-mode:plus-lighter'' to this pseudo element if the ancestor
    ''::page-transition-image-wrapper'' has both
    ''::page-transition-incoming-image'' and ''::page-transition-outgoing-image'' as
    descendants.

    Note: mix-blend-mode value of plus-lighter ensures that the blending of identical
    pixels from the outgoing and incoming images results in the same color value
    as those pixels.

    Additional [=user-agent origin=] styles added to animate these pseudo-elements
    are detailed in [=Animate a page transition=].

: <dfn>::page-transition-incoming-image( <<pt-tag-selector>> )</dfn>
::  Identical to ''::page-transition-outgoing-image()'',
    except it deals with the incoming element instead.

The precise tree structure, and in particular the order of sibling
pseudo-elements, is defined in the [=Create transition pseudo-elements=]
algorithm.

# Concepts # {#concepts}

## Phases ## {#phases-concept}

<dfn>Phases</dfn> represent an ordered sequence of states. Since [=phases=] are ordered, prose can refer to phases <dfn for="phases">before</dfn> a particular phase, meaning they appear earlier in the sequence, or <dfn for="phases">after</dfn> a particular phase, meaning they appear later in the sequence.

The initial phase is the first item in the sequence.

## The [=page-transition layer=] stacking layer ## {#page-transition-stacking-layer}

This specification introduces a stacking layer to the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/zindex.html">Elaborate description of Stacking Contexts</a>.

The ''::page-transition'' pseudo-element generates a new stacking context
called <dfn>page-transition layer</dfn> with the following characteristics:

1. Its parent stacking context is the root stacking context.

1. If the ''page-transition'' pseudo-element exists, a new stacking
    context is created for the
    <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-root">root</a>
    and <a href="https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#top-layer">top layer</a>
    elements.
    The ''page-transition layer'' is a sibling of this stacking context.

1. The ''page-transition layer'' paints after the stacking context for the
     <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-root">root</a>
    and <a href="https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#top-layer">top layer</a>
    elements.

Note: The intent of the feature is to be able to capture the contents of the
page, which includes the top layer elements. In order to accomplish that, the
''page-transition layer'' cannot be a part of the captured top layer context,
since that results in a circular dependency. Instead, this stacking context is a
sibling of other page contents.

Issue: Do we need to clarify that the stacking context for the root and top
layer elements has filters and effects coming from the root element's style?

## [=Captured elements=] ## {#captured-elements}

A <dfn>captured element</dfn> is a [=struct=] with the following:

<dl dfn-for="captured element">
    : <dfn>outgoing image</dfn>
    :: an image or null. Initially null.

        Issue: The type of "image" needs to be linked or defined.

    : <dfn>outgoing styles</dfn>
    :: a set of styles or null. Initially null.

        Issue: The type of "a set of styles" needs to be linked or defined.

    : <dfn>incoming element</dfn>
    :: an element or null. Initially null.

        Issue: The type of "element" needs to be linked or defined.
</dl>

## Additions to {{Document}} ## {#additions-to-document}

A {{Document}} additionally has:

<dl dfn-for="document">
    : <dfn>active DOM transition</dfn>
    :: a {{DOMTransition}} or null. Initially null.

    : <dfn>transition suppressing rendering</dfn>
    :: a boolean. Initially false.
</dl>

# API # {#api}

## Additions to {{Document}} ## {#additions-to-document-api}

<script type=idl>
partial interface Document {
    DOMTransition createTransition(DOMTransitionInit init);
};

dictionary DOMTransitionInit {
    required UpdateDOMCallback updateDOM;
};

callback UpdateDOMCallback = Promise<any> ();
</script>

### {{Document/createTransition()}} ### {#DOMTransition-prepare}

<div algorithm>
    The [=method steps=] for
    <dfn method for=Document>createTransition(|init|)</dfn>
    are as follows:

    1. Let |transition| be a new {{DOMTransition}} object in [=this's=] [=relevant Realm=].

    1. Set |transition|'s [=DOMTransition/DOM update callback=] to |init|[{{DOMTransitionInit/updateDOM}}].

    1. Let |document| be [=this's=] [=relevant global object's=] [=associated document=].

    1. If |document|'s [=active DOM transition=] is not null, then [=skip the page transition=] |document|'s [=active DOM transition=]
        with an "{{AbortError}}" {{DOMException}} in [=this's=] [=relevant Realm=].

        Note: This can result in two asynchronous [=DOMTransition/DOM update callbacks=] running concurrently. One for the |document|'s current [=active DOM transition=], and another for this |transition|. As per the [design of this feature](#transitions-as-enhancements), it's assumed that the developer is using another feature or framework to correctly schedule these DOM changes.

    1. Set |document|'s [=active DOM transition=] to |transition|.

        Note: The process continues in [=perform an outgoing capture=].

    1. Return |transition|.
</div>

<div class=example>
    If the default animations for the page transition are acceptable,
    then kicking off a transition
    requires nothing more than setting 'page-transition-tag' in the page's CSS,
    and a single line of script to start it:

    <pre highlight=js>
        document.createTransition({
            updateDOM() {
                coolFramework.changeTheDOMToPageB();
            }
        });
    </pre>

    If more precise management is needed, however,
    transition elements can be managed in script:

    <pre highlight=js>
        async function doTransition() {
            // Specify "outgoing" elements. The tag is used to match against
            // "incoming" elements they should transition to, and to refer to
            // the transitioning pseudo-element.
            document.querySelector('.old-message').style.pageTransitionTag = 'message';

            const transition = document.createTransition({
                async updateDOM() {
                    // This callback is invoked by the browser when "outgoing"
                    // capture finishes and the DOM can be switched to the new
                    // state. No frames are rendered until this callback returns.

                    // DOM changes may be asynchronous
                    await coolFramework.changeTheDOMToPageB();

                    // Tagging elements during the updateDOM() callback marks them as
                    // "incoming", to be matched up with the same-tagged "outgoing"
                    // elements marked previously and transitioned between.
                    document.querySelector('.new-message').style.pageTransitionTag =
                        'message';
                },
            });

            // When ready resolves, all pseudo-elements for this transition have
            // been generated.
            // They can now be accessed in script to set up custom animations.
            await transition.ready;

            document.documentElement.animate(keyframes, {
                ...animationOptions,
                pseudoElement: '::page-transition-container(message)',
            });

            // When the finished promise resolves, that means the transition is
            // finished.
            await transition.finished;
        }
    </pre>
</div>

## The {{DOMTransition}} interface ## {#the-domtransition-interface}

<script type=idl>
[Exposed=Window]
interface DOMTransition {
    undefined skipTransition();
    readonly attribute Promise<undefined> finished;
    readonly attribute Promise<undefined> ready;
    readonly attribute Promise<undefined> domUpdated;
};
</script>

<div class="note">
    The {{DOMTransition}} represents and controls
    a single same-document transition. That is, it controls a transition where the
    starting and ending document are the same, possibly with changes to the
    document's DOM structure.
</div>

A {{DOMTransition}} has the following:

<dl dfn-for="DOMTransition">
    : <dfn>tagged elements</dfn>
    :: a [=/map=],
        whose keys are [=page transition tags=] and whose values are [=captured elements=].
        Initially a new [=map=].

    : <dfn>phase</dfn>
    :: One of the following [=phases=]:

        1. "`pending-capture`".
        1. "`dom-update-callback-called`".
        1. "`animating`".
        1. "`done`".

    : <dfn>DOM update callback</dfn>
    :: an {{UpdateDOMCallback}} or null. Initially null.

    : <dfn>ready promise</dfn>
    :: a {{Promise}}.
        Initially [=a new promise=] in [=this's=] [=relevant Realm=].

    : <dfn>DOM updated promise</dfn>
    :: a {{Promise}}.
        Initially [=a new promise=] in [=this's=] [=relevant Realm=].

    : <dfn>finished promise</dfn>
    :: a {{Promise}}.
        Initially [=a new promise=] in [=this's=] [=relevant Realm=].
</dl>

The {{DOMTransition/finished}} [=getter steps=] are to return [=this's=] [=DOMTransition/finished promise=].

The {{DOMTransition/ready}} [=getter steps=] are to return [=this's=] [=DOMTransition/ready promise=].

The {{DOMTransition/domUpdated}} [=getter steps=] are to return [=this's=] [=DOMTransition/DOM updated promise=].

### {{DOMTransition/skipTransition()}} ### {#DOMTransition-skipTransition}

<div algorithm>
    The [=method steps=] for <dfn method for="DOMTransition">skipTransition()</dfn> are:

    1. If [=this=]'s [=DOMTransition/phase=] is not "`done`",
        then [=skip the page transition=] for [=this=]
        with an "{{AbortError}}" {{DOMException}}.
</div>

# Algorithms # {#algorithms}

## Monkey patches to rendering ## {#monkey-patch-to-rendering-algorithm}

<div algorithm="monkey patch to rendering">
    Run the following steps before [marking paint timing](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-processing-model:mark-paint-timing) in the [=update the rendering=] steps:

    1. For each [=fully active=] {{Document}} in <var ignore>docs</var>,
        [=perform pending transition operations=] for that {{Document}}.

    Note: These steps will be added to the [=update the rendering=] in the HTML spec.
        As such, the prose style is written to match other steps in that algorithm.
</div>

<div algorithm="suppress rendering">
    Issue: Define where this sits within the [=update the rendering=] steps.

    1. For each {{Document}} in <var ignore>docs</var> with a [=document/transition suppressing rendering=] of true:

        Issue: Define this behavior. Lifecycle updates can still be triggered
        via script APIs which query style or layout information but no visual updates
        are presented to the user. Is this the same behavior as render-blocking?

        Issue: How should input be handled when in this state? The last frame presented
        to the user will not reflect the DOM state as it asynchronously switches to
        the new version.

        Note: The aim is to prevent unintended DOM updates from being presented to the
        user after a cached snapshot for the elements has been captured. We wait for
        one rendering opportunity after prepare to present DOM mutations made by the
        author before prepare to be presented to the user. This is also the content
        captured in snapshots.

    Note: These steps will be added to the [=update the rendering=] in the HTML spec.
        As such, the prose style is written to match other steps in that algorithm.
</div>

## [=Perform pending transition operations=] ## {#perform-pending-transition-operations-algorithm}

<div algorithm>
    To <dfn>perform pending transition operations</dfn> given a {{Document}} |document|,
        perform the following steps:

    1. If |document|'s [=document/active DOM transition=] is not null, then:

        1. If |document|'s [=document/active DOM transition=]'s [=DOMTransition/phase=] is "`pending-capture`", then [=perform an outgoing capture=] with |document|'s [=document/active DOM transition=].

        1. Otherwise, if |document|'s [=document/active DOM transition=]'s [=DOMTransition/phase=] is "`animating`", then [=update transition DOM=] for |document|'s [=document/active DOM transition=].
</div>

## [=Perform an outgoing capture=] ## {#perform-an-outgoing-capture-algorithm}

<div algorithm>
    To <dfn>perform an outgoing capture</dfn> given a {{DOMTransition}} |transition|,
        perform the following steps:

    1. Let |taggedElements| be |transition|'s [=DOMTransition/tagged elements=].

    1. Let |usedTransitionTags| be a new [=/set=] of strings.

    1. Let |document| be |transition|'s [=relevant global object's=] [=associated document=].

    1. [=list/For each=] |element| of every {{Element}} and [=pseudo-element=] connected to |document|,
        in [paint order](https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#painting-order):

        Issue: The link for "paint order" doesn't seem right.
            Is there a more canonical definition?

        1. Let |transitionTag| be the [=computed value=] of 'page-transition-tag' for |element|.

        1. If |transitionTag| is ''page-transition-tag/none'',
            or |element| is [=element-not-rendered|not rendered=],
            then [=continue=].

        1. If any of the following is true:

            * |usedTransitionTags| [=list/contains=] |transitionTag|.

            * |element| is not |element|'s [=tree/root=] and |element| does not have [=layout containment=].

            * |element| is not |element|'s [=tree/root=] and |element| allows [=fragmentation=].

            Then [=skip the page transition=] for |transition| with an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}
                in |transition|'s [=relevant Realm=],
                and return.

        1. [=set/Append=] |transitionTag| to |usedTransitionTags|.

        1. Let |capture| be a new [=captured element=] struct.

        1. Set |capture|'s [=outgoing image=] to the result of [=capturing the image=] of |element|.

        1. Set |capture|'s [=outgoing styles=] to the following:

            : 'transform'
            :: A CSS transform that would place |element|
                from the layout viewport origin to its current quad.
            :: This value is identity for the root element.

            : 'width'
            : 'height'
            :: The width and height of |element|'s border box.
            :: This value is the bounds of the initial containing block for the root element.

            : 'object-view-box'
            :: An 'object-view-box' value that,
                when applied to the outgoing image,
                will cause the view box to coincide with |element|'s [=border box=]
                in the image.

            : 'writing-mode'
            :: The 'writing-mode' of |element|.

## [=Capture the image=] ## {#capture-the-image-algorithm}

<div algorithm>
    To <dfn lt="capture the image|capturing the image">capture the image</dfn> given an {{Element}} |element|, perform the following steps.
    They return an image.

    1. Render the referenced element and its descendants,
        at the same size that they would be in the document,
        over an infinite transparent canvas with the following characteristics:

        * The origin of |element|'s [=ink overflow rectangle=] is anchored to canvas origin.

        * If the referenced element has a transform applied to it (or its ancestors),
            then the transform is ignored.

            Note: This transform is applied to the snapshot using the `transform` property of the associated ''::page-transition-container'' pseudo-element.

        * [=list/For each=] |descendant| of [=shadow-including descendant=] {{Element}} and [=pseudo-element=] of |element|,
            if |descendant| has a [=computed value=] of 'page-transition-tag' that is not ''page-transition-tag/none'',
            then skip painting |descendant|.

            Note: This is necessary since the descendant will generate its own snapshot which will be displayed and animated independently.

            Issue: Refactor this so the algorithm takes a set of elements that will be captured. This centralizes the logic for deciding if an element should be included or not.

    1. Let |interestRectangle| be the result of [=computing the interest rectangle=] for |element|.

        Note: The |interestRectangle| is the subset of |element|'s [=ink overflow rectangle=] that should be captured.
            This is required for cases where an element's ink overflow rectangle needs to be clipped because of hardware constraints.
            For example, if it exceeds the maximum texture size.

    1. Return the portion of the canvas within |interestRectangle| as an image.
        The natural size of the image is equal to the |interestRectangle| bounds.

        check whether there is an active animation associated with this pseudo-element.

        Issue: Define what active animation means here.

    1. If no [=page-transition pseudo-elements=] has an active animation:

        Issue: There needs to be a definition/link for "active animation".

        1. Set |transition|'s [=DOMTransition/phase=] to "`done`".

        1. Remove all associated [=page-transition pseudo-elements=] from |document|.

            set |incoming|'s 'object-view-box' property
            to a value that when applied to |incoming|,

    1. Set |transition|'s [=DOMTransition/phase=] to "`animating`".

    Issue: How are keyframes scoped to user-agent origin? We could decide
