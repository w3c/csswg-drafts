Abstract: This specification defines a model for synchronization and
    timing of changes to the presentation of a Web page.
    This specification also defines an application programming interface
    for interacting with this model and it is expected that further
    specifications will define declarative means for exposing these
    features.
Ignored Vars: auto-rewind, current direction, index, initial progress,
    timeline, new timeline, t, going forwards

<h2 id="delta">Delta specification</h2>

<p>This is a delta specification, meaning that it currently contains
only the differences from Web Animations Level 1 [[!WEB-ANIMATIONS-1]].
Once the Level 1 specification is closer to complete, it will be merged
with the additions here into a complete level 2 specification.</p>

<h2 id="changes-since-level-1">Changes since level 1</h2>

This specification introduces the following changes compared to the
previous level of this specification:

*   <a>group effects</a> and <a>sequence effects</a>,
*   an <a>animation effect</a>-specific
    <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback rate</a>,
*   <a>custom effects</a>.
*   Support for non-monotonic (scroll) timelines.
*   Adds animation hold phase.

<h2 id="timing-model">Timing model</h2>

This section describes and defines the behavior of the Web Animations
timing model.

<h3 id="timing-model-overview">Timing model overview</h3>

<div class='informative-bg'>

<em>This section is non-normative</em>

<h4 id="hierarchical">Hierarchical</h4>

This level of the specification includes an updated timing hierarchy diagram.

<figure>
  <img src="img/time-hierarchy.svg" width="600"
            alt="A hierarchy of timing nodes">
  <figcaption>
    A hierarchy of timing nodes.
    Each node in the tree derives its time from its parent node.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Along with the following updated description:

>   A consequence of this hierarchical arrangement is that complex
>   animation arrangements can be reversed, scheduled, accelerated and so
>   on as a whole unit since the manipulations applied to the parent,
>   cascade down to its <a>descendants</a>.
>   Furthermore, since time has a common source, it is easy to synchronize
>   animations.

</div>


<h3 id="timelines">Timelines</h3>

Add:

> The <dfn lt="timeline duration">duration</dfn> of a timeline gives the
> maximum value a timeline may generate for its current time. This value is
> used to calculate the [=intrinsic iteration duration=] for the target effect
> of an animation that is associated with the timeline when the effect's
> [=iteration duration=] is 'auto'. The value is computed such that the effect
> fills the available time. For a monotonic timeline, there is no upper bound
> on current time, and [=timeline duration=] is unresolved. For a non-monotonic
> (e.g. scroll) timeline, the duration has a fixed upper bound. In this
> case, the timeline is a <dfn lt="progress-based timeline">progress-based
> timeline</dfn>, and its [=timeline duration=] is 100%.

<h3 id="animations">Animations</h3>

After the paragraph on [=hold time=], add:

> In addition to the <a>hold time</a>, an <a>animation</a> maintains a
> <dfn>hold phase</dfn> which is set along with the <a>hold time</a> to
> hold the effective timeline phase of an animation with a fixed
> <a>current time</a>.
> The <a>hold phase</a> has the same range of values as the associated
> timeline's [=timeline phase=] and can be set or unset.
> The <a>hold phase</a> is initially unset.

Append:

> Animation effects associated with a [=progress-based timeline=] require their
> timing properties to be converted to proportions. The procedure for converting
> a <dfn lt="time-based animation to a proportional animation"></dfn> is as
> follows:
>
> 1.  If the [=iteration duration=] is auto, then perform the following steps.
>     *   Set [=start delay=] and [=end delay=] to 0, as it is not
>         possible to mix time and proportions.
>
>         Note: Future versions may allow these properties to be assigned
>         percentages, at which point the delays are only to be ignored if
>         their values are expressed as times and not as percentages.
>
>     Otherwise:
>          1. Let <var>total time</var> be equal to |end time|
>          1. Set [=start delay=] to be the result of evaluating
>             <code>|specified start delay| / |total time| *
>             |timeline duration|</code>.
>          1. Set [=iteration duration=] to be the result of evaluating
>             <code>|specified iteration duration| / |total time| *
>             |timeline duration|</code>.
>          1. Set [=end delay=] to be the result of evaluating
>             <code>|specified end delay| / |total time| *
>             |timeline duration|</code>.
>
> The procedure to <dfn>normalize specified timing</dfn> is as follows:
>
> If [=timeline duration=] is resolved:
>     *   Follow the procedure to convert a [=time-based animation to a

> Otherwise:
>     1.   Set [=start delay=] = |specified start delay|
>     1.   Set [=end delay=] = |specified end delay|

<h4 id="setting-the-timeline">Setting the timeline of an animation</h4>

The procedure to <dfn>set the timeline of an animation</dfn>,
<var>animation</var>, to <var>new timeline</var> which may be null, is as
follows:

1.  Let <var>old timeline</var> be the current <a>timeline</a> of
    <var>animation</var>, if any.
1.  If <var>new timeline</var> is the same object as <var>old timeline</var>,
    abort this procedure.
1.  Let |previous play state| be |animation|'s [=play state=].
1.  Let |previous current time| be the |animation|'s [=current time=].
1.  Let |previous current phase| be the |animation|'s [=current phase=].
1.  Set |previous progress| based in the first condition that applies:
    <dl class=switch>
        :   If |previous current time| is unresolved:

        ::  Set |previous progress| to unresolved.

        :   If [=end time=] is zero:

        ::  Set |previous progress| to zero.

        :   Otherwise

        ::  Set |previous progress| = <code>|previous current time| /
            [=end time=]</code>
    </dl>
1.  Let |from finite timeline| be true if |old timeline| is not null and
    not [=monotonically increasing=].
1.  Let |to finite timeline| be true if |timeline| is not null and not
    [=monotonically increasing=].
1.  Let the <a>timeline</a> of <var>animation</var> be <var>new timeline</var>.
1.  Set the flag |reset current time on resume| to false.
1.  Perform the steps corresponding to the <em>first</em> matching
    condition from the following, if any:

    <dl class="switch">

        :   If |to finite timeline|,

        ::  1.  [=Apply any pending playback rate=] on |animation|
            1.  Let |seek time| be zero if [=playback=] rate &ge; 0, and
                |animation|'s <a>associated effect end</a> otherwise.
            1.  Update the animation based on the first matching condition if any:

                <dl class="switch">

                    :   If <em>either</em> of the following conditions are true:
                        *    |previous play state| is 'running' or,
                        *    |previous play state| is 'finished'

                    ::  Set |animation|'s [=start time=] to |seek time|.

                    :   If |previous play state| is 'paused':

                    ::  If |previous progress| is resolved:

                        1.  Set the flag |reset current time on resume| to true.
                        1.  Set [=start time=] to unresolved.
                        1.  Set [=hold time=] to |previous progress| *
                            [=end time=].
                        1.  Set [=hold phase=] to |previous current phase|.

                        <p class="note">
                        This step ensures that |previous progress| is preserved
                        even in the case of a pause-pending animation with a resolved [=start time=].
                        <p>

                    :: Otherwise

                        1. Set [=start time=] to |seek time|.

                </dl>

        :   If |from finite timeline| and |previous progress| is resolved,

        ::  Run the procedure to <a>set the current time</a> to
            |previous progress| * [=end time=].

    </dl>

1.  If the [=start time=] of <var>animation</var> is <a
    lt=unresolved>resolved</a>, make <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a>
    <a>unresolved</a>, and make <a>hold phase</a> unset.

    <p class="note">
    This step ensures that the <a>finished play state</a> of
    <var>animation</var> is not &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; but is re-evaluated
    based on its updated <a>current time</a>.
    <p>

1.  Run the procedure to <a>update an animation's finished state</a> for
    <var>animation</var> with the <var>did seek</var> flag set to false, and
    the <var>synchronously notify</var> flag set to false.

Issue: If <var>new timeline</var> is null, we should ensure that <a>custom
effects</a> get called with an <a>unresolved</a> <a>iteration progress</a>
(unless a subsequent change in the same script execution context makes this
redundant).

<h4 id="setting-the-target-effect">Setting the target effect of an
  animation</h4>

After the step to reschedule a <a>pending play task</a> add the following step:

> 1.  If <var>new effect</var> is not <code>null</code> and
>     if <var>new effect</var> has a <a>parent group</a>,
>     <a lt="remove an animation effect">remove</a> <var>new effect</var> from
>     its <a>parent group</a>.

After the step to assign <var>new effect</var> as <var>animation</var>'s
<a>target effect</a> include the following step:

> 1.  If <var>old effect</var> is not <code>null</code>, queue a task to call
>     any <a>custom effects</a> associated with <a>inclusive descendants</a> of
>     <var>old effect</var> with an <a>unresolved</a> <a>iteration progress</a>.
>
>     <div class="issue">
>       This is not quite right. If <var>old effect</var> is attached to another

>
>       The definition of when <a>custom effects</a> gets called needs to be
>       audited and probably rewritten.
>     </div>


<h4 id='waiting-for-the-target-effect'>Waiting for the target effect</h4>

The definition of when an animation is ready needs to be extended to consider
descendant effects and custom effects such that the first condition is:

> *   the user agent has completed any setup required to begin the playback of
>     each <a>inclusive descendant</a> of
>     the animation's <a>target effect</a>
>     including rendering the first frame of any <a>keyframe
>     effect</a> or executing any <a>custom effects</a> associated with an
>     <a>animation effect</a>.

<h4 id='validating-a-css-numberish-time'>Validating a CSSNumberish time</h4>

The procedure to <dfn>validate a CSSNumberish time</dfn> for an input
value of <var>time</var> is based on the first condition that matches:

<dl class="switch">

    :   If <em>all</em> of the following conditions are true:

        *   The animation is associated with a [=progress-based timeline=], and
        *   <var>time</var> is not a CSSNumeric value with percent units:

    ::  <a>throw</a> a <span class="exceptionname">TypeError</span>.
    ::  return false;

    :   If <em>all</em> of the following conditions are true:

        *   The animation is not associated with a [=progress-based timeline=],
            and
        *   <var>time</var> is a CSSNumericValue, and
        *   the units of time are not <a type lt="<time>">duration units</a>:

    ::  <a>throw</a> a <span class="exceptionname">TypeError</span>.
    ::  return false.

    :   Oterwise
    ::  return true.

</dl>


<h4 id='setting-the-current-time-of-an-animation'>Setting the current time of an
Animation</h4>

The <a>current time</a> of an animation can be set to a new value to
<em>seek</em> the animation.
The procedure for setting the current time is defined in two parts.

The procedure to <dfn>silently set the current time</dfn> of
an animation, <var>animation</var>, to <var>seek time</var> is as follows:

1.  If <var>seek time</var> is an <a>unresolved</a> time value,
    then perform the following steps.

    1.   If the <a>current time</a> is <a lt=unresolved>resolved</a>, then
         <a>throw</a> a <span class=exceptionname>TypeError</span>.

    1.   Abort these steps.

1.  Let <var>valid seek time</var> be the result of running the
    [=validate a CSSNumberish time=] procedure with <var>seek time</var>
    as the input.

1.  If <var>valid seek time</var> is false, abort this procedure.

1.  Update either <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a> or
    [=start time=] as follows:

    <dl class="switch">

        :   If <em>any</em> of the following conditions are true:

            *   <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a> is
                <a lt="unresolved">resolved</a>, or
            *   <var>animation</var>'s [=start time=]
                is <a lt="unresolved">unresolved</a>, or
            *   <var>animation</var> has no associated <a>timeline</a> or
                the associated <a>timeline</a> is
                <a lt="inactive timeline">inactive</a>, or
            *   <var>animation</var>'s [=playback rate=] is 0,

        ::  1.  Set <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a> to
                <var>seek time</var>.
            1.  Set <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold phase</a> to
                the associated timeline's [=timeline phase=].

        :   Otherwise,
        ::  Set <var>animation</var>'s [=start time=] to the result of
            evaluating
            <code>|timeline time| - (|seek time| / [=playback rate=])</code>
            where <var>timeline time</var> is the current <a>time value</a>
            of <a>timeline</a> associated with <var>animation</var>.

    </dl>

1.  If <var>animation</var> has no associated <a>timeline</a> or the associated
    <a>timeline</a> is <a lt="inactive timeline">inactive</a>,
    make <var>animation</var>'s [=start time=] <a>unresolved</a>.

    <p class=note>
      This preserves the invariant that when we don't have an active timeline it
      is only possible to set <em>either</em> the [=start time=]
      <em>or</em> the animation's <a>current time</a>.
    </p>

1.  Make <var>animation</var>'s <a>previous current time</a> <a>unresolved</a>.

1. Set the |reset current time on resume| flag to false.


The procedure to <dfn>set the current time</dfn> of an animation,
<var>animation</var>, to <var>seek time</var> is as follows:

1.  Run the steps to <a>silently set the current time</a> of
    <var>animation</var> to <var>seek time</var>.
1.  If <var>animation</var> has a <a>pending pause task</a>, synchronously
    complete the pause operation by performing the following steps:
    1.  Set <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a> to <var>seek time</var>.
    1.  Set <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold phase</a> to the associated
        timeline's [=timeline phase=].
    1.  [=Apply any pending playback rate=] to |animation|.
    1.  Make <var>animation</var>'s [=start time=] <a>unresolved</a>.
    1.  Cancel the <a>pending pause task</a>.
    1.  <a lt="resolve a Promise">Resolve</a> <var>animation</var>'s

    the <var>synchronously notify</var> flag set to false.

<h4 id='setting-the-start-time-of-an-animation'>Setting the start time of an
Animation</h4>


The procedure to <dfn>set the start time</dfn>
of <a>animation</a>, <var>animation</var>, to <var>new start time</var>,
is as follows:

1.  Let <var>valid start time</var> be the result of running the
    [=validate a CSSNumberish time=] procedure with
    <var>new start time</var> as the input.

1.  If <var>valid start time</var> is false, abort this procedure.

1.  Let <var>timeline time</var> be the current <a>time value</a> of the
    <a>timeline</a> that <var>animation</var> is associated with.
    If there is no <a>timeline</a> associated with <var>animation</var> or the
    associated timeline is <a lt="inactive timeline">inactive</a>,
    let the <var>timeline time</var> be <a>unresolved</a>.

1.  If <var>timeline time</var> is <a>unresolved</a> and <var>new start

    <a>hold time</a> <a>unresolved</a> and make <a>hold phase</a> unset.

    <p class=note>
      This preserves the invariant that when we don't have an active timeline it
      is only possible to set <em>either</em> the [=start time=]
      <em>or</em> the animation's <a>current time</a>.
    </p>

1.  Let <var>previous current time</var> be <var>animation</var>'s <a>current
    time</a>.

    Note: This is the <a>current time</a> after applying the changes from the
    previous step which may cause the <a>current time</a> to become
    <a>unresolved</a>.

1.  Let <var>previous current phase</var> be <var>animation</var>'s <a>current
    phase</a>.

1.  [=Apply any pending playback rate=] on |animation|.

1.  Set <var>animation</var>'s [=start time=] to <var>new start time</var>.

1.  Set the |reset current time on resume| flag to false.

1.  Update <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a> and <a>hold phase</a> based
    on the first matching condition from the following,

    1.  <a lt="resolve a promise">Resolve</a> <var>animation</var>'s <a>current

        <div class="note">
            Note that the order of the above two steps is important

            before its <a>current finished promise</a>.
        </div>

    So long as the above task is scheduled but has yet to run,
    <var>animation</var> is described as having a
    <dfn>pending play task</dfn>.
    While the task is running, however, |animation| does <em>not</em> have
    a [=pending play task=].

    If a user agent determines that |animation| is immediately <a>ready</a>, it
    may schedule the above task as a microtask such that it runs at the next
    <a lt="perform a microtask checkpoint">microtask checkpoint</a>, but it must
    <em>not</em> perform the task synchronously.

    <div class="note">

    The above requirement to run the <a>pending play task</a> asynchronously

    In the above code, were the [=pending play task=] run synchronously, the
    [=current ready promise=] would not be rejected.

1.  Run the procedure to <a>update an animation's finished state</a> for
    <var>animation</var> with the <var>did seek</var> flag set to false, and
    the <var>synchronously notify</var> flag set to false.

Issue: The procedure to [=play an animation=] needs to include scheduling a task for
updating [=custom effects=].


<h4 id='pausing-an-animation-section'>Pausing an animation</h4>

The procedure to [=pause an animation=] needs to refer not only to the
[=target effect=] but also any descendants of the [=target effect=].

Likewise, the procedure to [=pause an animation=] needs to include scheduling
a task for updating [=custom effects=].

Update the procedure to [=pause an animation=] as follows:

Replace:

>   ::  Set <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a> to <var>seek time</var>.

with:

>   ::  1.  Set <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a> to
>           <var>seek time</var>.
>       1.  Set <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold phase</a> to the associated
>           associated timeline's [=timeline phase=].

Replace:

>    1.  If <var>animation</var>'s [=start time=]
>        is <a lt=unresolved>resolved</a> and its <a>hold time</a> is
>        <em>not</em> resolved,
>        let <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a> be the result of evaluating
>        <code>(<var>ready time</var> - [=start time=]) &times;
>        [=playback rate=]</code>.

with:

>    1.  If <var>animation</var>'s [=start time=]
>        is <a lt=unresolved>resolved</a> and its <a>hold time</a> is
>        <em>not</em> resolved,
>        let <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a> be the result of evaluating
>        <code>(<var>ready time</var> - [=start time=]) &times;
>        [=playback rate=]</code> and let <var>animation</var>'s
>        <a>hold phase</a> be the associated timeline's [=timeline phase=].

<h4 id='canceling-an-animation-section'>Canceling an animation</h4>

Update the procedure to [=cancel an animation=] as follows:

After resetting the hold time add the step:

>    1.  Make <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold phase</a> unset.

Append the final step:

> 1.  Queue a task to call any <a>custom effects</a> associated with
>     <a>inclusive descendants</a> of
>     <var>animation</var>'s <a>target effect</a>
>     with an <a>unresolved</a> iteration progress.

<h3 id="animation-effects">Animation effects</h3>

<h4 id="types-of-animation-effects">Types of animation effects</h4>

This specification defines two types of <a>animation effects</a>:

* <a>keyframe effects</a>, and
* <a>group effects</a>.


<h4 id="the-active-interval">The active interval</h4>

In this level of the specification the lower bound of the active interval is
defined as:

>     The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> is determined by the
>     <a lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> of the
>     <a>animation effect</a> but may be shifted by a <a>start delay</a> on
>     the <a>animation effect</a>.

The subsequent diagram should also refer to the <em>animation effect start
time</em> as opposed to the <em>animation start time</em>.

Finally, the description of the [=end delay=] is updated to:

>     An <a>end delay</a> may also be specified but is primarily only of
>     use when sequencing animations such as by using a <a>sequence effect</a>.

</div>

The normative description is updated as follows:

>     The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> is defined by the
>     combination of the animation effect's
>     <a lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> and <a>start delay</a>.

>
>     Unlike the <a lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> which

And finally regarding the definition of the [=end time=]:

>     The <dfn>end time</dfn> of an <a>animation effect</a> is the result of

<h4 id="local-time-and-inherited-time">Local time and inherited time</h4>

This section is added.

<div class="informative-bg">

In Web Animations all times are relative to some point of reference.
These different points of reference produce different <em>time
spaces</em>.

This can be compared to coordinate spaces as used in computer
graphics.
The zero time of a time space is analogous to the origin of
a coordinate space.

Just as with coordinate spaces, time spaces can also be nested.
<a>Group effects</a> typically perform some
transformations on the <a>time values</a> they
receive from their <a lt="parent group">parent</a> or
<a>animation</a> before passing on the transformed <a>time values</a>
to their children.
Child <a>animation effects</a> then operate <em>within</em> that
transformed time space.

Children take the transformed time values from their
parent&mdash;called the <a>inherited time</a>&mdash;and add their
<a lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> to establish
their own <a lt="local time">local time space</a> as illustrated
below.

    For <a>animation effect</a> (b) which has a <a

</div>

For an <a>animation effect</a>, the <dfn>inherited time</dfn> at
a given moment is based on the first matching condition from the
following:

<div class='switch'>

:   If the <a>animation effect</a> has a <a>parent group</a>,

:   Otherwise,
::  the inherited time is <a>unresolved</a>.

</div>

The <dfn>local time</dfn> of an <a>animation effect</a> is the
<a>animation effect</a>'s <a>inherited time</a> minus its <a
lt="animation effect start time">start time</a>.
If the <a>inherited time</a> is <a>unresolved</a> then the local time

<div class="issue">
Currently <a>timing functions</a> that generate results outside the
range [0, 1] will behave unexpectedly when applied to group
effects, as children will increase iterations or enter into fill mode
rather than continuing to extrapolate along their defined behavior
(which is what they would do if the timing function applied to them
directly).

To fix this it is possible we will wish to introduce &lsquo;overflow&rsquo;
fill modes that respond to time values larger than or smaller than the
active time range by extrapolating rather than filling.

<h3 id="animation-effect-speed-control">Animation effect speed control</h3>

(This section is added.)

Like <a>animations</a>, <a>animation effects</a> also have a <dfn
lt="animation effect playback rate">playback rate</dfn> parameter.
The <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback rate</a> of
an <a>animation effect</a> is a finite real number that acts as
a multiplier when calculating the <a>animation effect</a>'s <a>transformed
time</a> from its <a>local time</a>.

The effect of setting the <a lt="animation effect playback
rate">playback rate</a> of an <a>animation effect</a> differs from the
setting the <a lt="animation playback rate">playback rate</a> on
an animation.
Its behavior is defined in the timing calculations given in
[[#core-animation-effect-calculations]].

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

In summary, the behavior of the <a lt="animation effect playback
rate">playback rate</a> of an <a>animation effect</a> is as follows:

*   The <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback rate</a> is
    applied only to the <a>active interval</a> of an <a>animation
    effect</a> and not to the time while it is <a
    lt="start delay">delayed</a> or <a lt="fill mode">filling</a>.

*   Setting a negative <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback
    rate</a> on an <a>animation effect</a> causes the <a>animation
    effect</a> to begin at the end of its <a>active interval</a>.
    This differs from the <a lt="animation playback rate">playback
    rate</a> on an <a>animation</a>.
    Setting a <a lt="animation playback rate">playback rate</a> on
    an <a>animation</a> to a negative value at a moment before the
    <a>animation</a>'s </a>target effect</a> has begun, will result in the
    <a>target effect</a> never playing.

*   Setting the <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback
    rate</a> of an <a>animation effect</a> affects the calculated value of
    the <a>active duration</a> (see [[#calculating-the-active-duration]]).

*   Changing the <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback
    rate</a> of an <a>animation effect</a> whose <a>local time</a> is
    within its <a>active interval</a> will cause it to jump.
    This is because the <a>active duration</a> will be updated but the
    <a>local time</a> will not.

    Furthermore, if other <a>animation effects</a> depend on the
    <a>animation effect</a>'s <a>active duration</a>, such as sibling
    <a>animation effect</a> in a <a>sequence effect</a>, they
    too may jump as a result of setting the <a>animation effect</a>'s <a
    lt="animation effect playback rate">playback rate</a>.

    For runtime speed control the <a
    lt="animation playback rate">playback rate</a> of the
    <a>animation</a> should be used.

<h3 id="time-transformations">Time transformations</h3>

<div class="issue">
Currently, the set of <a>timing functions</a> allowed on

This has raised concern about complexity of implementation and also
complexity of behavior with regards to fill modes.
As a result, allowing the full set of timing functions on group
effects is considered <strong>at risk</strong>.

Alternatives are to either restrict timing functions on group
effects to the <a>linear timing function</a> or to a set of
&ldquo;simple&rdquo; timing functions that have properties that
alleviate some of the concerns with the more complex timing

While it is possible to set the timing properties of <a>animation
effects</a> individually, it is often useful to synchronize <a>animation
effects</a> so that they share common timing properties and maintain
their temporal relationship.  This is achieved using an <a>group
effect</a>.

A simple example is illustrated below.

Note: in applying these definitions to <a>animation effects</a>, the
    term <em>parent</em> refers exclusively to a <a>parent group</a> and does
    <em>not</em> include the <a>animation</a> which with
    an <a>animation effect</a> may be <a
    lt="directly associated with an animation">directly associated</a>
    despite the fact that conceptually the <a>animation</a> acts as a parent
    time source.

The temporal relationship between a <a>child effect</a> and its
<a>parent group</a> is incorporated in the definition of
<a>inherited time</a> (see [[#local-time-and-inherited-time]]).

<h4 id="relationship-of-group-time-to-child-time">Relationship of group time to child time</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

The timing of the children of a <a>group effect</a> is based on
the timing of the group.
Specifically, times for the children are based on the parent's
<a>transformed time</a>.
With regards to repetition, this means the children operate
<em>inside</em> an iteration of the parent.

For example, if a <a>group effect</a> has an <a>iteration
count</a> of 2, then the children of the group will all play twice
since they effectively play <em>inside</em> the group's iterations.

<figure>
  <img src="img/grouping-repetition.svg" width="600"
    alt="The effect of multiple iterations on the children of a group.">
  <figcaption>
    Since children of a <a>group effect</a> base their timing on the
    group's <a>transformed time</a>, when the group repeats, the
    children play again.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Note that even in this case, the child <a>animation effects</a> still
have only <em>one</em> <a>active interval</a>.
However, as a result of the parent's timing, the <a>active
interval</a> is played twice.

If an <a>iteration count</a> is specified for the children of a group
as well as for the group itself, the effect is as if the <a>iteration
count</a> of the group was multiplied with the <a>iteration count</a>
of the children.

<figure>
  <img src="img/grouping-repetition-and-animation-repetition.svg"
    width="600" alt="Iteration counts are multiplicative.">
  <figcaption>
    Specifying an <a>iteration count</a> of 2 on a <a>group effect</a>
    and an <a>iteration count</a> of 3 on one of its children results in
    that child playing 6 times.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

A further result of the children of a <a>group effect</a> basing
their timing on the group's <a>transformed time</a> is that they
cannot animate outside of the group's <a>active interval</a>.
This is because the <a>transformed time</a> of a group will not
change outside its <a>active interval</a>.
This allows groups to <em>clip</em> the playback of their children.

<figure>
  <img src="img/grouping-clipping.svg" width="600"
    alt="Groups clip the active interval of contained children.">
  <figcaption>
    In the first instance, an <a>animation effect</a> has a negative delay
    and an infinite <a>iteration count</a>.<br>
    However, when a similar <a>animation effect</a> is placed inside
    a <a>group effect</a> with a specified <a>iteration duration</a>
    it has the effect of clipping the child <a>animation effect</a>'s
    <a>active interval</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Some further consequences of <a>group effect</a> children basing
their timing on their parent group's <a>transformed time</a> are:

*   Setting the <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback
    rate</a> of a <a>group effect</a> will speed up or slow down all
    children.

*   Changing the <a>playback direction</a> of a <a>group effect</a>
    will change the direction of all children.

*   Applying a <a>timing function</a> to a <a>group effect</a> will
    affect the progress of all children.

<h4 id="the-start-time-of-children-of-a-group-effect">The start time of
  children of a group effect</h4>

The <a lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> of a <a>child
effect</a> of a <a>group effect</a> is zero.

Note that specific types of <a>group effects</a> may override
this definition to provide other kinds of synchronization behavior.

<h4 id="the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-group-effect">The intrinsic
  iteration duration of a group effect</h4>

The <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> of a <a>group
effect</a> is based on the time when the last <a>child effect</a> completes
its <a>active interval</a> and depends on the
number of <a>child effects</a> as follows.

<dl class="switch">

    :   If the group has no <a>child effects</a>,
    ::  the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> is zero.

    :   Otherwise,

            after calculating the <a>end time</a> of each <a>child
            effect</a> in the group. The <a>end time</a> may be
            expressed as a time or a percentage (in the case of a
            [=progress-based animation=]). In the event of mixed time and
            percentage <a>end time</a>s, the largest time based value
            equates to 100% for the purpose of time scaling.
        2.  The <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> is the result of
            evaluating <code>max(0, <var>maximum end
            time</var>)</code>.

</dl>

This definition of the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> may be
overridden by specific types of <a>group effects</a>.

<h4 id="sequence-effects">Sequence effects</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Specific types of <a>group effects</a> can be used to provide
different kinds of synchronization behavior for their children.
This specification defines one additional type of <a>group
effect</a>: a <a>sequence effect</a>.
<a>Sequence effects</a> arrange the start times of their
children so that they run one at a time, in turn.

Compare the two arrangements illustrated below:

<figure>
  <img src="img/grouping-types.svg" width="600"
    alt="Group effects and sequence effects.">
  <figcaption>
    Group effects and sequence effects.<br>

        simultaneously.<br>
    (b) is a <a>sequence effect</a> where the children run in turn.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Since <a>group effects</a> can also contain other <a>group
effects</a>, complex synchronization is possible by combining
different types of groups as illustrated below.

<figure>
  <img src="img/grouping-nesting.svg" width="600"
    alt="Nesting of group effects.">
  <figcaption>
    A <a>sequence effect</a> that contains a regular <a>group
    effect</a> as a child.<br>
    The <a>group effect</a> waits for the previous child of the
    <a>sequence effect</a> to finish, and then the children of the
    <a>group effect</a> play simultaneously.
    After they have finished the next child of the <a>sequence
    effect</a> plays.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

A <dfn>sequence effect</dfn> is a type of <a>group effect</a>
that schedules its <a>child effects</a> such that they play in
turn following their order in the group.
This sequencing is achieved by adjusting the <a
lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> of each <a>child
effect</a> in the group.

<h5 id="the-start-time-of-children-of-a-sequence-effect">The start time of
  children of a sequence effect</h5>

The <a lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> of
a <a>child effect</a> of a <a>sequence effect</a> is the
<a>end time</a> of the child's <a>previous sibling</a>.
If the child has no <a>previous sibling</a> the start time is zero.

<div class="note">
When the <a>active duration</a> is positive infinity the behavior
for calculating the <a>end time</a> of an <a>animation effect</a>
and the <a lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> of
subsequent children follows the usual behavior defined by IEEE
754-2008.
As a result, if any of the children of a <a>sequence
effect</a> has an infinite <a>active duration</a>, any children
that occur later in the sequence will not play.

Similarly, the above definition does not restrict
<a lt="animation effect start time">start times</a> to positive
values and hence some children may not play due to a negative
<a>start delay</a> on children that occur earlier in the group
since their <a>active interval</a> may end before the group's <a
lt="animation effect start time">start time</a>.
</div>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Because the start of the <a>active interval</a> is based on the
sum of an <a>animation effect</a>'s <a
lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> <em>and</em>
<a>start delay</a>, the <a>active intervals</a> of
children of a <a>sequence effect</a> need not run in strict
sequence but can be shifted back and forth by using the <a>start
delay</a> as shown in the following diagram.

<figure>
  <img src="img/sequence-groups-and-start-delays.svg" width="600"
    alt="Using negative start delays to overlap children of seq
        groups">
  <figcaption>
    Example of using the <a>start delay</a> on children of a
    <a>sequence effect</a> to shift their timing so that they
    overlap (a negative delay) or are spaced apart (a positive delay).
  </figcaption>
</figure>

A negative <a>start delay</a> can be used to cause the <a>active
interval</a> of two children to overlap.
Note that the <a>start delay</a> affects the <a
lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> of subsequent
children in the group.

</div>

<h5 id="the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-sequence-effect">The intrinsic
  iteration duration of a sequence effect</h5>

The <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> of a <a>sequence
effect</a> is equivalent to the <a
lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> of a hypothetical
<a>child effect</a> appended to the group's children
calculated according to the definition in <a
href="#the-start-time-of-children-of-a-sequence-effect"
section></a> unless that produces a negative value, in
which case the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> is zero.

As a result, if the <a>sequence effect</a> has no <a>child
effects</a> the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> will be
zero.

<h4 id="the-effect-value-of-a-keyframe-animation-effect">The effect value of a keyframe effect</h4>

The procedure for computing the <a>effect value</a> of a single property
referenced by a <a>keyframe effect</a> as one of its <a>target properties</a>,
for a given <var ignore=''>iteration progress</var>, <var>current iteration</var> and
<var ignore=''>underlying value</var> is amended by inserting the following step
after the step to apply the keyframe effect composite mode.

12. For each <var>keyframe</var> in <var ignore=''>interval endpoints</var>:

    1.  (As in web-animations-1).

    1.  If this <a>keyframe effect</a> has an <a>iteration
        composite operation</a> of <a
        lt="iteration composite operation accumulate">accumulate</a>,
        apply the following step <var>current iteration</var> times:

        *   replace the property value of <var>target property</var>
            on <var>keyframe</var> with the result of combining the
            property value on the final keyframe in <var ignore=''>property-specific
            keyframes</var> (<var>V</var><sub>a</sub>) with the
            property value on <var>keyframe</var>
            (<var>V</var><sub>b</sub>) using the <a
            lt="value accumulation">accumulation procedure</a>
            defined for <var>target property</var>.

        Note: The order of arguments here is important. In the case where
              the animation type of the target property does not define a
              procedure for accumulation or addition, the default definition
              for these procedures result in <var>V</var><sub>b</sub> being
              returned. When performing iteration composition on properties
              that do not support accumulation, the result should be the
              initial property value of <var>target property</var> on
              <var>keyframe</var>, hence we make this
              <var>V</var><sub>b</sub> in the above step.

<h3 id="effect-accumulation-section">Effect accumulation</h3>

Similar to the compositing performed between <a>effect values</a>
(see [[web-animations-1#effect-composition]]), the <dfn>iteration composite operation</dfn>
determines how values are combined between successive iterations of
the same <a>keyframe effect</a>.

This specification defines two <a>iteration composite operations</a>
as follows:

:   <dfn lt="iteration composite operation replace">replace</dfn>
::  Each successive iteration is calculated independently of previous
    iterations.
:   <dfn lt="iteration composite operation accumulate">accumulate
::  Successive iterations of the animation are <a
    lt="value accumulation">accumulated</a> with the
    final value of the previous iteration.

    The application of the <a>iteration composite operation</a> is
    incorporated in the calculation of the <a>effect value</a> in <a
    href="#the-effect-value-of-a-keyframe-animation-effect"
    section></a>.


<h3 id="custom-effects">Custom effects</h3>

(This section is added.)

Issue: This whole feature needs to be revisited. The current thinking is that
       rather than having custom effects, we should simply have an
       <code>onupdate</code> callback on each <a>animation effect</a>.  That
       would allow, for example, augmenting an existing effect with a function
       that performs logging or triggers additional actions at certain times.
       With the current arrangement, doing this would require adding a parent
       group just to achieve this.

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

In some situations the <a>animation
effects</a> provided by Web Animations may be insufficient.
For example, the <a>animation effects</a>
defined here are only able to target certain CSS properties.
They are unable, therefore, to modify the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#__svg__SVGSVGElement__currentScale"><code>currentScale</code></a>
property of an SVG element to smoothly zoom the viewport without
affecting the document content.

In such cases, where the provided <a>animation
effects</a> do not provide needed functionality, an effect defined by
script may be used.
Such <a>custom effects</a> receive an <a>iteration
progress</a> and <a>current iteration</a> from the timing model and
are responsible for producing an effect corresponding to the specified
time.

Using an effect defined in script it is possible to animate not only
otherwise un-animatable attributes and properties, but potentially
anything that is accessible via script, including even producing audio
or creating vibrations.

For example, using a <a>custom effect</a> that draws to a <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element"><code>canvas</code></a>
element, it is possible to produce a complex animated effect
featuring patterns that may be difficult to create using CSS or
SVG.
Compared to using <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/">Timing control for
script-based animations</a>,
this approach ensures the animation is frame-rate
independent and can be paused, reversed, eased with timing effects,
accelerated, synchronized with other animations, and be controlled
in the same manner as any other Web Animations animation without any
additional programming.

</div>

A <dfn>custom effect</dfn> is an author-defined programming callback
that is passed timing information as part of the [=update animations and send
events=] procedure.

Issue: It needs to be called whenever timing properties are updated too, right?

<h4 id="updating-custom-effects">Sampling custom effects</h4>

<a>Custom effects</a> are called for each referencing <a>animation effect</a>
when the [=update animations and send events=] procedure is performed
(henceforth referred to simple as an <em>update</em>) based on
the following criteria.

1.  If, on the previous update, the <a>animation effect</a>
    referencing the <a>custom effect</a>:

    *   was <a>in effect</a>, and
    *   referenced this same <a>custom effect</a>, and
    *   had a different <a>target element</a>

    Call the callback passing an <a>unresolved</a> <a>iteration progress</a>
    and the <a>target element</a> from the previous update as parameters to
    the callback.
2.  Call the callback for the current <a>target element</a> based on
    the first matching condition from the following:

    <dl class="switch">

        :   If the <a>animation effect</a> referencing the custom
            effect is not <a>in effect</a> but was <a>in effect</a> in the previous
            update,
        ::  Call the callback passing an <a>unresolved</a> <a>iteration progress</a>
            and the current <a>target element</a> as parameters to the callback.
        :   Otherwise, if the <a>animation effect</a> referencing
            the custom effect:
        ::

            *   <strong>is <a>in effect</a>, and</strong>
            *   <strong>was not <a>in effect</a> in the previous update, or
                was <a>in effect</a> but with a different <a>iteration
                progress</a> or <a>current iteration</a>,</strong>

        ::  Call the callback passing with the referencing
            <a>animation effect</a>'s current <a>iteration
            progress</a> and <a>target element</a> as parameters to the callback.

    </dl>

<div class="issue">
There may be use cases where an action needs to be triggered at
a specific point in an animation tree.
In many cases this can be achieved by inserting a custom effect with
a step-start easing that spans the period during which the action
should be triggered.
However, this can impose additional layout requirements on the
content which might be cumbersome to accommodate.

Some alternatives under consideration:

*   Additional calling conditions could be defined to accommodate
    zero-width custom effects. For example, it could be required
    that the callback be called if (given infinite precision) there
    was a time between the previous and current update times that
    aligned with the custom effect.
*   Instead of adding special calling conditions to custom effects,
    a new type of animation effect, Trigger, could be introduced. The
    trigger would only ever act as a zero-width custom effect as
    described above, its constructor would take a callback function,
    but not require a target or timing. It could also specify other
    calling conventions, for example whether it should only trigger
    in a specific playback direction.

</div>

<h4 id="execution-order-of-custom-effects">Execution order of custom effects</h4>

Since <a>custom effects</a>, unlike <a
lt="animation effect">animation effects</a>, are not limited to
a single <a>target property</a>, the steps for assessing their
order of execution differs from <a>animation effects</a>.f

<a>Custom effects</a> are executed after all
<a>animation effects</a> have completed and
applied their result to their targets (see Applying the composited result).

Issue: Need to define this more precisely.
    Are styles flushed?
    Presumably they are.
    Can we suspend reflow for the duration of executing the script-based
    animation effects and just do it once afterwards?

Within the set of <a>custom effects</a>, the
order of execution is the same as that defined for <a>animation effects</a> in
[[#the-effect-stack]].
Items sorted earlier are executed before those sorted later.

An {{EffectCallback}} is called each time an {{KeyframeEffect}} object
with which it is associated is updated.

<div class="parameters">

:   double? progress
::  The <a>iteration progress</a> value for which to produce an effect.
    When this is <code>null</code>, the function SHOULD
    remove the effect.

:   (Element or CSSPseudoElement) currentTarget
::  The <a>target element</a> on which this callback is expected
    to operate.

    <div class="note">

    Note that <var>currentTarget</var> may differ from
    <code><var>animation</var>.target</code>.

    If the <a>target element</a> of <var>animation</var>
    is changed between updates, this method will be
    called once with a null <var>progress</var> and the
    previous <a>target element</a> as the
    <var>currentTarget</var>, then again with the current
    <var>progress</var> and the updated <a>target
    element</a> as the <var>currentTarget</var>.
    This allows the animation effect to be removed from the old
    <a>target element</a>.

    </div>

:   Animation animation
::  The {{Animation}} object that is being updated.

Regarding the section on, &ldquo; Changes made to the Web Animations model take
effect immediately&rdquo;, add:

>     The same concept applies to more complex modifications of the
>     Web Animations model such as adding and removing children from
>     an {{GroupEffect}}.

Add:

> :   Changes made to the model using the programming interface do
>     <em>not</em> cause any {{EffectCallback}} functions to be

> ::  For example, in the following code, the callback function will
