      This specification defines a model for synchronization and timing of
      changes to the presentation of a Web page.
      This specification also defines an application programming interface for
      interacting with this model and it is expected that further specifications
      will define declarative means for exposing these features.
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Web Animations defines a model for supporting animation and
        synchronization on the Web platform.
        It is intended that other specifications will build on this model and
        expose its features through declarative means.
        In addition, this specification also defines a programming interface to
        the model that may be implemented by user agents that provide support
        for scripting.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Use cases</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations model aims at two broad areas of application:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>User interface effects</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Animation can be used to give visual clues and feedback to make
              a user interface more readily comprehensible.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a user action results in a table row being
              removed to represent an item being removed from a shopping cart.
              In such a case, fading the row to transparent and then shifting
              the subsequent rows up to fill the space over a few hundred
              milliseconds provides the user with clear feedback as to the
              results of their action as opposed to instantly removing the row
              from the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              To support this scenario not only are the animated effects of
              fading and shifting required, but so is synchronization, both
              between the animations, and between animations and scripted
              actions (removing the table row from the DOM after the animations
              have completed).
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Storytelling and visualisation</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Another type of animation uses the animated effect to convey
              a story or represent some information.
              Unlike user interface effects which are largely a presentational
              adjunct to the content, these animations form an essential part of
              the content presented to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in an animated cartoon two cats fly through space
              to another planet leaving a rainbow trail behind them.
              After arriving at the planet a change of scene occurs and the user
              should decide whether or not the cats enter a magic mountain by
              selecting one of two preset destinations in the scene.
            </p>
            <p>
              This scenario requires the following features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>animated effects for moving characters along a path as well as
                  warping a path (the rainbow trail),
              <li>synchronization that allows some actions to happen
                  simultaneously (the two cats moving) and others in sequence
                  (the change of scene),
              <li>play control to allow rewinding the cartoon, or changing its
                  playback rate to accommodate particular learning or
                  accessibility needs,
              <li>the ability to trigger animations in response to user input
            </ul>
            <p>
              Similar use cases in this category include visualising physical
              phenomena such as spring motion for educational purposes,
              or visualising data such as the prevalence of a disease over
              a geographical space over a year whereby animation is used to
              present the time-based component of the data.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

      <section>
        <h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>
        <p>
          CSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]], CSS Animations 
          [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]], and SVG [[SVG11]] all provide mechanisms that
          generate animated content on a Web page.
          Although the three specifications provide many similar features,
          they are described in different terms.
          This specification proposes an abstract animation model that
          encompasses the common features of all three specifications.
          This model is backwards-compatible with the current behavior of these
          specifications such that they can be defined in terms of this model
          without any observable change.
        </p>
        <p>
          The animation features in SVG 1.1 are defined in terms of SMIL
          Animation [[SMIL-ANIMATION]].
          It is intended that by defining SVG's animation features in terms of
          the Web Animations model, the dependency between SVG and SMIL
          Animation can be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The programming interface component of this specification makes
          some additions to interfaces defined in HTML5 [[HTML5]].
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Overview of this specification</h3>
        <p>
          This specification begins by defining an abstract model for animation.
          This is followed by a programming interface defined in terms of the
          abstract model.
          The programming interface is defined in terms of the abstract model
          and is only relevant to user agents that provide scripting support.

      <h2>Web Animations model overview</h2>
      <p>
        At a glance, the Web Animations model consists of two largely
        independent pieces, a <em>timing model</em> and an <em>animation
        model</em>.  The role of these pieces is as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Timing model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes a moment in time and converts it to a proportional distance
          within a single iteration of an animation called the <em>time
          fraction</em>.
          An <em>iteration index</em> is also generated for animations
          that vary as they repeat.
        </dd>
        <dt>Animation model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes the <em>time fractions</em> and <em>iteration indices</em>
          produced by the timing model and converts them into a series of values
          to apply to the target properties and attributes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Graphically, this flow can be represented as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/timing-and-animation-models.svg" width="600"
            alt='Overview of the operation of the Web Animations model.'>
      </div>
      <p class="caption">
        Overview of the operation of the Web Animations model.<br>
        The current time is input to the timing model which produces a time
        fraction and an iteration index.<br>
        These parameters are used as input to the animation model which produces
        the values to apply.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider an animation that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>starts after 3 seconds,</li>
        <li>runs twice,</li>
        <li>takes 2 seconds every time, and</li>
        <li>changes the width of a rectangle from 50 pixels to 100
            pixels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first three points apply to the timing model.
        At a time of 6 seconds, it will calculate that the animation should be
        half-way through its second iteration and produces the result 0.5.
        The animation model then uses that information to calculate a width
        for the rectangle of 75.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification begins with the timing model and then proceeds to
        the animation model.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Timing model</h2>
      <p>
        This section describes and defines the behavior of the Web Animations
        timing model.
      </p>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>The timing model at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        Two features characterise the Web Animations timing model: it is
        <em>stateless</em> and it is <em>hierarchical</em>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Stateless</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations timing model operates by taking an input time and
          producing an output time fraction.
          Since the output is based solely on the input time and is independent
          of previous inputs, the model may be described as stateless.
          This gives the model the following properties:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Frame-rate independent</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the output is independent of previous inputs, the rate at
            which the model is sampled will not affect its progress.
            Provided the input times are proportional to the progress of
            real-world time, animations will progress at an identical rate
            regardless of the capabilities of the device running them.
          </dd>
          <dt>Direction-agnostic</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the sequence of inputs is insignificant, the model is
            directionless.
            This means that the model can be sampled in reverse or even in
            a backwards and forwards pattern without requiring any specialized
            handling.
          </dd>
          <dt>Constant-time seeking</dt>
          <dd>
            Since each input is independent of the previous input, the
            processing required to perform a seek operation, even far into the
            future, is at least potentially constant.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          There are a few exceptions to the stateless behavior of the timing
          model.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, a number of methods defined in the <a
          href="#programming-interface">programming interface</a> to the model
          provide play control such as pausing an item.
          These methods are defined in terms of the time at which they are
          called and are therefore stative.
          These methods are provided primarily for convenience and are not part
          of the core timing model but are layered on top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, <a>player events</a> are fired when the first sample occurs
          at the limit of the <a>source content</a>.
          This too is stative behavior but is part of the play control layered
          on top of the timing model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the <a href="#limiting-the-current-time">limiting
          behavior</a> of players means that dynamic changes to the end time of
          the media (source content) of a player may produce a different result
          depending on when the change occurs.
          This behavior is somewhat unfortunate but has been deemed intuitive
          and consistent with HTML.
          As a result, the model can only truly be described as stateless
          <em>in the absence of dynamic changes to its timing properties</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, each time the model is sampled, it can be considered to
          establish a temporary state.
          While this temporary state affects the values returned from the <a
          href="#programming-interface">programming interface</a>, it has no
          influence on the subsequent samples and hence does not conflict with
          the stateless qualities described above.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Hierarchical</h3>
        <p>
          The other characteristic feature of the Web Animations timing model is
          that time is inherited.
          Time begins with a monotonically increasing time source and cascades
          down a number of steps to each animation.
          At each step, time may be shifted backwards and forwards, scaled,
          reversed, paused, and repeated.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/time-hierarchy.svg" width="600"
            alt="A hierarchy of timing nodes">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          A hierarchy of timing nodes.
          Each node in the tree derives its time from its parent node.
          At the root of the tree is the global clock.
        </p>
        <p>
          A consequence of this hierarchical arrangement is that complex
          animation arrangements can be reversed, scheduled, accelerated and so
          on as a whole unit since the manipulations applied to the parent
          cascade down to its <a>descendants</a>.
          Furthermore, since time has a common source, it is easy to synchronize
          animations.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Timing model concepts</h2>
      <p>
        In Web Animations timing is based on a hierarchy of time relationships
        between timing nodes.
        Parent nodes provide timing information to their child nodes in the form
        of <a>time values</a>.
        A <dfn>time value</dfn> is a real number which nominally represents
        a number of seconds from some moment.
        The connection between <a>time values</a> and wall-clock seconds may be
        obscured by any number of transformations applied to the value as it
        passes through the time hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p class="annotation">
        In the future we may have timelines that are based on UI gestures in
        which case the connection between time values and seconds will be
        weakened even further.
      </p>
      <p>
        Periodically, the user agent will trigger an update to the timing model
        in a process called <dfn>sampling</dfn>.
        On each <dfn>sample</dfn> the <a>time values</a> of each timing node are
        updated.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        A more precise definition of when the model is updated when scripting is
        involved is provided in <a
        href="#script-execution-and-live-updates-to-the-model"
        class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The global clock</h2>
      <p>
        At the root of the Web Animations timing hierarchy is the <a>global
        clock</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>global clock</dfn> is a source of monotonically increasing
        <a>time values</a> unaffected by adjustments to the system clock.
        The <a>time values</a> produced by the <a>global clock</a> represent
        wall-clock seconds from an unspecified historical moment.
        Because the zero time of the <a>global clock</a> is not specified,
        the absolute values of the <a>time values</a> produced by the <a>global
        clock</a> are not significant, only their rate of change.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note that the <a>global clock</a> is not exposed in the <a
        href="#programming-interface">programming interface</a> and nor is it
        expected to be exposed by markup.
        As a result the moment from which <a>global clock</a> <a>time values</a>
        are measured, that is, the zero time of the clock, is
        implementation-dependent.
        One user agent may measure the number of seconds since the the user
        agent was loaded whilst another may use the time when the device was
        started.
        Both approaches are acceptable and produce no observable difference
        in the output of the model.

      <h2>Timelines</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>timeline</dfn> provides a source of <a>time values</a> for the
        purpose of synchronization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, a <a>timeline</a> is tied to the <a>global clock</a> such
        that its absolute time is calculated as a fixed offset from the time of
        the <a>global clock</a>.
        This offset is established by designating some moment as the timeline's
        <dfn>zero time</dfn> and recording the <a>time value</a> of the
        <a>global clock</a> at that moment.
        At subsequent moments, the <a>time value</a> of the timeline is
        calculated as the difference between the current <a>time value</a> of
        the <a>global clock</a> and the value recorded at the <a>zero time</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="annotation">
        Note that we anticipate that other types of timelines may be introduced
        in the future that are not tied to the global clock.
        For example, a timeline whose time values correspond to UI gestures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since a <a>timeline</a> may be defined relative to a moment that has yet
        to occur, it may not always be able to return a meaningful <a>time
        value</a>.
        A <a>timeline</a> is considered to be <dfn>not started</dfn> when it is
        in such a state that it cannot produce a <a>time value</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        Should this be renamed to something like &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; so we
        can accommodate possible future timelines that may, after starting,
        become unable to return a meaningful <a>time value</a>?
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>The document timeline</h3>
        <p>
          Each document has a <a>timeline</a> called the <dfn>document
          timeline</dfn>.
          The <a>time values</a> of the <a>document timeline</a> are calculated
          as a fixed offset from the <a>global clock</a> such that the <a>zero
          time</a> corresponds to
          the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/#dom-performancetiming-navigationstart"><code>navigationStart</code></a>
          moment [[!NAVIGATION-TIMING]].
          Prior to this moment, the <a>document timeline</a> is <a>not
          started</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            Since the <a>document timeline</a> is tied to the <a>global
            clock</a> by a fixed offset, <a>time values</a> reported by the
            <a>document timeline</a> increase monotonically.
            Furthermore, since no scaling is applied, these <a>time values</a>
            are proportional to wall-clock seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the <a>time values</a> of the <a>document timeline</a> are
            relative to the <code>navigationStart</code> time,
            <code>document.timeline.currentTime</code> will correspond to
            <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time/#dom-performance-now"><code>Performance.now()</code></a>
            [[HR-TIME]] but converted to seconds rather than milliseconds.

      <h2>Players</h2>
      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          The children of a <a>timeline</a> are called <em>players</em>.
          A player takes a <a>timed item</a> which is a static description of
          some timed behavior and binds it to a <a>timeline</a> so that it runs.
          A player also allows run-time control of the connection between the
          <a>timed item</a> and its <a>timeline</a> by providing pausing,
          seeking, and speed control.
          The relationship between a player and a <a>timed item</a> is analogous
          to that of a DVD player and a DVD.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A <dfn>player</dfn> connects a single <a>timed item</a>, called its
        <dfn>source content</dfn>, to a <a>timeline</a> and provides playback
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>player</a> records the <a>time value</a> of its <a>timeline</a>
        at which its <a>source content</a> is scheduled to begin
        as the <dfn>player start time</dfn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a <a>player</a> is created, it is assigned a globally unique
        sequence number called the <dfn>player sequence number</dfn>.
        This number is used to resolve the sort order of players that have the
        same <a title="player start time">start time</a> for a variety of
        situations such as combining animations, queuing events, and returning
        the list of current players.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>The current time of a player</h3>
        <p>
          <a>Players</a> provide a <a>time value</a> to their <a>source
          content</a> called the player's <dfn>current time</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The calculation of the <a>current time</a> is as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <code><a>current time</a> =
          (<var>timeline time</var> - <a>player start time</a>)
          &times; <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a>
          - <a>time lag</a></code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><var>timeline time</var> is the current <a>time value</a> of the
          <a>timeline</a> with which this <a>player</a> is associated.</li>
          <li><var>player start time</var> is the player's <a
          title="player start time">start time</a>.</li>
          <li><var>playback rate</var> is the player's <a
          title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> value described in <a
          href="#speed-control" class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
          <li><var>time lag</var> is the <a>time lag</a> value described in
          <a href="#seeking--pausing-and-limiting" class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the <a>timeline</a> with which the <a>player</a> is associated is
          <a>not started</a> then the <a>current time</a> is <code>null</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is often useful to manipulate the <a>current time</a> of a player
          even when its associated <a>timeline</a> is <a>not started</a>, for
          example, to pre-seek a player.
          For this purpose, we define the <dfn>effective current time</dfn> of
          a player as the result of evaluating the <a>current time</a> as above
          but substituting the <a>effective timeline time</a> for the
          <var>timeline time</var>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedure for performing manual updates to the <a>current time</a>
          is defined in <a href="#performing-a-seek" class="sectionRef"></a>.

        <h3>Seeking, pausing and limiting</h3>
        <p>
          Seeking, pausing and limiting a player are closely related and are
          described here together.
        </p>
        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Introduction to seeking</h4>
          <p>
            Changing the current playback position of a player can be used to
            rewind its <a>source content</a> to its start point, fast-forward
            to a point in the future, or to provide ad-hoc synchronization
            between timed items.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in Web Animations, the <a title="player start time">start
            time</a> of a <a>player</a> has special significance in determining
            the priority of animations (see <a href="#combining-animations"
            class="sectionRef"></a>) and so we cannot simply adjust the <a
            title="player start time">start time</a>.
            Instead, an additional offset is introduced called the <a>time
            lag</a> that further offsets a player's <a>current time</a> from
            its timeline.
            The effect of the <a>time lag</a> when seeking is illustrated
            below.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/seeking.svg" width="600"
                alt="The effect of seeking a player.">
          </div>
          <p class="caption">
            At time <var>t</var>, a seek is performed on the player changing its
            <a>current time</a> from 1.5s to 2s.<br>
            As a result, the <a>time lag</a> is set to -0.5s.<br>
            Note that the <a title="player start time">start time</a> indicated
            by a red star does not change.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible to seek a player even if its <a>timeline</a> is
            <a>not started</a>.
            Once the timeline begins, the player will begin playback from the
            seeked time.

        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Introduction to pausing</h4>
          <p>
            Pausing can be used to temporarily suspend a <a>player</a>.
            Like seeking, pausing effectively causes the <a>current time</a> of
            a player to be offset from its <a>timeline</a> by means of
            setting the <a>time lag</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The effect of pausing on a <a>player</a>'s <a>time lag</a> is
            illustrated below.

            the duration of the interval during which the <a>player</a> was
            paused is added to the <a>player</a>'s <a>time lag</a> whilst the
            <a title="player start time">start time</a> remains unaffected.

        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Limiting the current time</h4>
          <p>
            Players in the real world such as DVD players or cassette players
            typically continue playing until they reach the end of their media
            at which point they stop.
            If such players are able to play in reverse, they typically stop
            playing when they reach the beginning of their media.
            In order to emulate this behavior and to provide some consistency
            with HTML's <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-elements">media
            elements</a> [[HTML5]], the <a>current time</a> of Web Animations'
            players do not progress beyond the <a>end time</a> of their
            <a>source content</a> or play backwards past time zero.
            This is called <em>limiting</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Graphically, the effect of limiting is shown below.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/limiting.svg" width="500"
                alt="The effect of pausing a player.">
          </div>
          <p class="caption">
            The effect of limiting on a <a>player</a> with a start time of 1s,
            and source content of length 3s.
            After the <a>current time</a> of the player reaches the end of the
            source content, it is capped at 3s.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible, however, to seek the <a>current time</a> of
            a <a>player</a> to a time past the end of the <a>source content</a>.
            When doing so, the <a>current time</a> will not progress but the
            player will act as if it had been paused.
          </p>
          <p>
            This allows, for example, seeking the <a>current time</a> of
            a player with <em>no</em> <a>source content</a> to 5s.
            If <a>source content</a> with an <a>end time</a> later than 5s is
            later associated with the player, playback will begin from the 5s
            mark.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar behavior to the above scenarios may be arise when the
            length of a player's <a>source content</a> changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the <a>player playback rate</a> is negative, the <a>current
            time</a> does not progress past time zero although it may be seeked
            to a negative time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Limiting the <a>current time</a> acts like a sort of automatic
            pausing and is accomplished using the same machinery as pausing.

          <h4>Seeking, pausing and limiting properties</h4>
          <p>
            <a>Players</a> track three properties related to seeking, 
            pausing and limiting.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><dfn>time lag</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              The offset from a player's scheduled current time as defined by
              its <a title="player start time">start time</a>, and its actual
              current time after accounting for the effects of seeking,
              pausing, and limiting.
              The <a>time lag</a> is initially zero and is updated as per the
              definition in <a href="#calculating-the-time-lag"
              class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn>paused state</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              A boolean value that is true if the player is currently paused.
              The <a>paused state</a> is initially false.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn>hold time</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              The <a>effective current time</a> to maintain while the player is
              paused or effectively paused because it has reached the end
              of its source content and is <a>limited</a>.
              When neither of these conditions apply, the <a>hold time</a> is
              null.
              The <a>hold time</a> is initially null.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            In addition to these properties, implementations are required to
            keep track of the last calculated value of the <a>current time</a>
            in order to produce correct limiting behavior (see <a
            href="#calculating-the-time-lag" class="sectionRef"></a>).
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            It is possible to conflate the <a>hold time</a> with the previously
            calculated current time provided proper care is taken to update the
            stored value of the <a>time lag</a>.
            For clarity, however, these two values are separated in the
            following algorithms.
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            Is it actually the previously calculated value? Or the value
            calculated on the previous sample / seek? Does it actually make any
            practical difference?
          </p>
          <p>
            A number of calculations for performing seeking, pausing and
            limiting are defined to operate even when the associated
            <a>timeline</a> is <a>not started</a>.
            For such situations we define the <dfn>effective timeline time</dfn>
            as the current <a>time value</a> of the <a>timeline</a> associated
            with a <a>player</a> unless the timeline is <a>not started</a>, in
            which case the <var>effective timeline time</var> is zero.

        <section>
          <h4>Calculating the time lag</h4>
          <p>
            The <a>time lag</a> value is both a stored and a calculated value.
            When a player is paused or <a>limited</a>, the value is calculated
            from the <a>hold time</a>.
            When a player is not paused or limited, the stored value is used.
            The stored value is initially zero, and is updated when the player
            is unpaused, seeked, or becomes no longer limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            The value of <a>time lag</a> at a given moment is calculated as
            follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Let the <dfn>pause time lag</dfn> be the result of evaluating
                <code>(<a>effective timeline time</a> - <a>player start
                time</a>) &times; <a>player playback rate</a> -
                <a>hold time</a></code>.
            <li>Let the <dfn>unlimited current time</dfn> be the result of
                evaluating the <a>current time</a> using the stored
                value of the <a>time lag</a>.
            <li>Let the <dfn>source content end</dfn> be the <a>end time</a>
                of the player's <a>source content</a>.
                If the player has no <a>source content</a>, let the
                <em>source content end</em> be zero.
            <li>The time lag is then calculated using the first matching
                condition from below:
              <dl class="switch">
                <dt>If the <a>paused state</a> is true,</dt>
                <dd>Return the <a>pause time lag</a>.</dd>
                <dt>If the <a>player playback rate</a> &lt; zero and
                    the <a>unlimited current time</a> &le; zero,</dt>

        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            The rate of play of a player can be controlled by setting its
            <em>playback rate</em>.
            For example, setting a playback rate of 2 will cause the player's
            <a>current time</a> to increase at twice the rate of its
            <a>timeline</a>.
            Similarly, a playback rate of -1 will cause the player's <a>current
            time</a> to decrease at the same rate as the <a>time values</a> from
            its <a>timeline</a> increase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that <a>timed items</a> also have a <a
            title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> associated with
            them that behaves differently to that defined here.
          </p>

        <p>
          <a>Players</a> have a <dfn title="player playback

          of change of the associated <a>timeline</a>'s <a>time values</a> to
          the player's <a>current time</a>.
          The <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> is initially 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting a player's <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a>
          to zero effectively pauses the player but without affecting the

            rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The procedure is as follows:

        <h3>Relationship between timed items and players</h3>
        <p>
          The <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a>, if set, is a type of

          with that player.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>Timed items</a> can be combined together into a hierarchy using
          <a>animation groups</a> (see <a href="#grouping-and-synchronization"
          class="sectionRef"></a>).
          Only the <a>root</a> <a>timed item</a> of such a hierarchy can be
          <a>directly associated with a player</a>.
          If a <a>timed item</a> that has a <a>parent animation group</a> is
          designated as the <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a>, the

        <p>
          A <a>timed item</a> is <dfn>associated with a player</dfn> if it is

            (c) A timed item with a negative delay; the beginning of the
            <a>active interval</a> is brought forward by the delay.
          </p>
          <p>
            An <a>end delay</a> may also be specified but is primarily only of
            use when sequencing animations such as by using a <a>sequence
            animation group</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <a>Timed items</a> define an <dfn>active interval</dfn> which is the
          period of time during which the item is scheduled to produce its
          effect with the exception of <a>fill modes</a> which apply outside
          the <a>active interval</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> is defined by the
          combination of the timed item's <a title="timed item start time">start
          time</a> and <a>start delay</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>timed item</a>'s <dfn title="timed item start time">start
          time</dfn> is the moment at which the <a>parent animation group</a>,
          if any, has scheduled the <a>timed item</a> to begin.
          It is expressed in <a>inherited time</a>.
          In most cases, including the case when the <a>timed item</a> has no
          <a>parent animation group</a>,
          the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> is zero.
          The singular exception is <a>sequence animation groups</a> which set
          the <a title="timed item start time">start times</a> of their children
          as described in <a
          href="#the-start-time-of-children-of-an-animation-sequence"
          class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a>,
          a <a>timed item</a> also has a <dfn>start delay</dfn> which is an
          offset from the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a>.
          Unlike the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> which is
          determined by the <a>parent animation group</a>, the <a>start
          delay</a> is a property of the <a>timed item</a> itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> of a <a>timed item</a>,
          expressed in <a title="inherited time">inherited time space</a>, is
          the sum of the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> and the
          <a>start delay</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These definitions are incorporated in the calculation of the <a>local
          time</a> (see <a href="#local-time-and-inherited-time"
          class="sectionRef"></a>) and <a>active time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of the <a>active interval</a> is called the <dfn>active
          duration</dfn>, the calculation of which is defined in <a
          href="#calculating-the-active-duration" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar to the <a>start delay</a>, a <a>timed item</a> also has an
          <dfn>end delay</dfn> which may be used to delay the <a
          title="timed item start time">start time</a>
          of the <a>next sibling</a> in a <a>sequence animation group</a>.

          <p>
            In Web Animations all times are relative to some point of reference.
            These different points of reference produce different <em>time
            spaces</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be compared to coordinate spaces as used in computer
            graphics.
            The zero time of a time space is analogous to the origin of
            a coordinate space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as with coordinate spaces, time spaces can also be nested.
            <a>Animation groups</a> typically perform some
            transformations on the <a>time values</a> they
            receive from their <a title="parent animation group">parent</a> or
            <a>player</a> before passing on the transformed <a>time values</a>
            to their children.
            Child <a>timed items</a> then operate <em>within</em> that
            transformed time space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children take the transformed time values from their
            parent&mdash;called the <a>inherited time</a>&mdash; and add their
            <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> to establish their
            own <a title="local time">local time space</a> as illustrated below.

          For a <a>timed item</a>, the <dfn>inherited time</dfn> at

        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            At a given moment, a <a>timed item</a> may be in one of three

            If a <a>timed item</a> has a <code>null</code> <a>local time</a> it
            will not be in any phase.

          <p class="caption">
            An example of the different phases and states used to describe
            a <a>timed item</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The phases are as follows:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><a>before phase</a></dt>
            <dd>
              The <a>timed item</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls before the item's
              <a>active interval</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt><a>active phase</a></dt>
            <dd>
              The <a>timed item</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls inside the item's
              <a>active interval</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt><a>after phase</a></dt>
            <dd>
              The <a>timed item</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls after the item's
              <a>active interval</a>.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            In addition to these phases, a <a>timed item</a> may also be
            described as being in one of several overlapping <em>states</em>.
            These states are only established for the duration of a single
            sample and are primarily a convenience for describing stative parts
            of the model.
          </p>
          <p>
            These states and their useage within the model are summarised as
            follows:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><a>in play</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                Corresponds to a <a>timed item</a> whose <a>active time</a> is
                changing on each sample.
                This occurs when the <a>timed item</a> <em>and all its
                ancestors</em> are in the <a>active phase</a>.
                <a>Animations</a> only &ldquo;move&rdquo; when they are
                <a>in play</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is possible for a <a>timed item</a> to be in the <a>active
                phase</a> but not <a>in play</a>.
                For example, if a <a>timed item</a> has a <a>parent animation
                group</a> that causes the timed item's <a>active interval</a> to
                be clipped and both parent and child apply the same <a>fill
                mode</a>, the child <a>timed item</a> may be effectively be
                snapshotted within the <a>active phase</a> despite no longer
                being <a>in play</a>.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><a>current</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                Corresponds to a <a>timed item</a> that is either <a>in play</a>
                or may become <a>in play</a> in the future.
                This will be the case if the <a>timed item</a> is <a>in play</a>
                or in its <a>before phase</a>, <em>or</em> it has an ancestor
                for which this is true thereby opening up the possibility that
                this <a>timed item</a> might play again (e.g. due to repeating).
              </p>
              <p>
                This state is used in the <a
                href="#programming-interface">programming interface</a> to
                identify all <a>animations</a> and <a>players</a> that are
                likely to be of interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the <a>current</a> state provides an important
                definition for managing the amount of memory required by
                implementations.
                Assuming a monotonically increasing <a>timeline</a> an
                implementation can safely discard all <a>timed items</a> that
                are <em>not</em> <a>current</a> and not referenced elsewhere
                provided they take care to preserve any fill values.
                This is because such <a>timed items</a> will no longer have any
                dynamic effect.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><a>in effect</a></dt>
            <dd>
              Corresponds to a <a>timed item</a> that has a resolved <a>active
              time</a>.
              This occurs when either the <a>timed item</a> is in its <a>active
              phase</a> or outside the <a>active interval</a> but at
              a time where the item's <a>fill mode</a> (see <a
              href="#fill-behavior" class="sectionRef"></a>) causes its
              <a>active time</a> to be resolved.
              Only <a>in effect</a> <a>animations</a> apply a result to
              their target.

      <h2>Repeating</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Iteration intervals</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to specify that a timed item should repeat
          a fixed number of times or indefinitely.
          This repetition occurs <em>within</em> the <a>active interval</a>.
          The span of time during which a single repetition takes place is
          called an <dfn>iteration interval</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the <a>active interval</a>, a timed item can have multiple
          <a>iteration intervals</a> although typically only the interval
          corresponding to the <a>current iteration</a> is of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of a single iteration is called the <dfn>iteration
          duration</dfn>.
          The initial <a>iteration duration</a> of a timed item is simply its
          <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>intrinsic iteration duration</dfn> of a timed item is zero,
          however some specific types of timed item such as <a>animation
          groups</a> override this behavior and provide an alternative intrinsic
          duration (see <a
          href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-an-animation-group"
          class="sectionRef"></a> and <a
          href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-an-animation-sequence"
          class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>iteration duration</a> of a <a>timed item</a> may be set by the
          author to represent a value other than the <a>intrinsic iteration
          duration</a>.

        <div class="informative">

        <h3>Controlling iteration</h3>
        <p>
          The number of times a <a>timed item</a> repeats is called its
          <dfn>iteration count</dfn>.
          The <a>iteration count</a> is a real number greater than or equal to
          zero.
          The <a>iteration count</a> may also be positive infinity to represent
          that the <a>timed item</a> repeats indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the <a>iteration count</a>, <a>timed items</a> also
          have an <dfn>iteration start</dfn> property which specifies an offset
          into the series of iterations at which the <a>timed item</a> should
          begin.
          The <a>iteration start</a> is a finite real number greater than or
          equal to zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behavior of these parameters is defined in the calculations in <a
          href="#core-timed-item-calculations" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            The effect of the <a>iteration count</a> and <a>iteration start</a>

            In the first case the <a>iteration count</a> is 2.5 resulting in the
            third iteration being cut-off half way through its <a>iteration
            interval</a>.<br>
            The second case is the same but with an <a>iteration start</a> of
            0.5.
            This causes the <a>timed item</a> to begin half way through the
            first iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the <a>iteration count</a> parameter, the <a>iteration

            duration</a>.

          <p>
            Note that values of <a>iteration start</a> greater than or equal to
            one are generally not useful unless used in combination with an

        <h3>Iteration time space</h3>
        <p>
          We have already encountered different time spaces in describing
          <a>local time</a> and <a>inherited time</a> (see <a
          href="#local-time-and-inherited-time" class="sectionRef"></a>).
          Repetition introduces yet another time space: the iteration time
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Iteration time space</em> is a time space whose zero time is the
          beginning of a timed item's current iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the Web Animations model we also refer to <a>active
          time</a> which is a time relative to the beginning of the active
          interval.
          This time space, however, is internal to the model and not exposed in
          the programming interface or in markup.
        </p>
        <p>
          These time spaces are illustrated below.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Note that while the time spaces themselves are not bounded, Web
          Animations defines <a>active time</a> and <a>iteration
          time</a> such that they are clamped to a set range as shown in the
          diagram.
          For example, whilst a time of -1 second is a valid time in
          <em>active time space</em>, the procedure for calculating the
          <a>active time</a> defined in <a
          href="#calculating-the-active-time" class="sectionRef"></a> will
          never return a negative value.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to these time spaces we can also refer to the
          <em>document time space</em> which is time space of the <a>time
          values</a> of the <a>document timeline</a> of the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#active-document">active

        <h3>Interval timing</h3>
        <p>
          When a timed item repeats we must define the behavior at the iteration
          boundaries.
          For this and indeed for all interval-timing, Web Animations uses an
          endpoint-exclusive timing model.
          This means that whilst the begin time of an interval
          is included in the interval, the end time time is not.
          In interval notation this can written <code>[begin, end)</code>.
          This model provides sensible behavior when intervals are repeated and
          sequenced since there is no overlap between the intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the examples below, for the repeated item, at local time 1s,
          the iteration time is 0.
          For the sequenced items, at inherited time 1s, only item B will be
          <a>in play</a>; there is no overlap.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">

          sequenced timed items there is no overlap at the boundaries between
          intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          An exception to this behavior is that when performing a <a
          href="#fill-behavior">fill</a>, if the fill begins at an
          interval endpoint, the endpoint is used.
          This behavior falls out of the algorithm given in <a
          href="#calculating-the-iteration-time"
          class="sectionRef"></a> and is illustrated below.

      <p>
        Like <a>players</a>, <a>timed items</a> also have a <dfn
        title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</dfn> parameter.
        The <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> of a <a>timed
        item</a> is a finite real number that acts as a multiplier when
        calculating the <a>timed item</a>'s <a>transformed time</a> from its
        <a>local time</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effect of setting the <a title="timed item playback rate">playback
        rate</a> of a <a>timed item</a> differs from the setting the <a
        title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> on a player.
        Its behavior is defined in the timing calculations given in <a

            This differs from the <a title="player playback rate">playback

          <li>
            Setting the <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> of
            a <a>timed item</a> affects the calculated value of the <a>active

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          At the core of the Web Animations timing model is the process that
          takes an <a>inherited time</a> value and converts it to an
          <a>iteration time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this further transformations are applied before resulting at
          a final <a>transformed time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step in this process is to calculate the bounds of the
          <a>active interval</a> which is determined by the <a>active
          duration</a>.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Calculating the active duration</h3>
        <p>
          In order to calculate the <a>active duration</a> we first define the
          <a>repeated duration</a> as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <dfn>repeated duration</dfn> =
            <code><a>iteration duration</a> &times;
                  <a>iteration count</a></code>
            <p>
              If either the <a>iteration duration</a> or <a>iteration count</a>
              are zero, the <a>repeated duration</a> is zero.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              This clarification is needed since the result of infinity
              multiplied by zero is undefined according to IEEE 754-2008.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The <a>active duration</a> is calculated according to the following
          steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If the <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> is
            zero, return <code>Infinity</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Otherwise, return <code><a>repeated duration</a>

            Before the <a>active time</a> can be converted to an <a>iteration

        <h3>Scaling the time</h3>
        <p>
          It is often desirable to control the rate at which a <a>timed item</a>
          progresses.
          For example, easing the rate of animation can create a sense of
          momentum and produce a more natural effect.
          Conversely, in other situations such as when modelling a discrete
          change, a smooth transition is undesirable and instead it is necessary
          for the <a>timed item</a> to progress in a series of distinct steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For such situations Web Animations provides <a>timing functions</a>
          that scale the progress of a <a>timed item</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>Timing functions</a> take an input time fraction and produce
          a scaled output time fraction.

        <p>
          A <dfn>timing function</dfn> takes an input time fraction in the range

          <a>Timed items</a> have one <a>timing function</a> associated with

          The default <a>timing function</a> is the <dfn>linear timing

        <h3>Scaling using a cubic Bézier curve</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            A common method of producing easing effects is to use a cubic Bézier
            curve to scale the time.
            The endpoints of the curve are fixed at (0, 0) and (1, 1) while two
            control points <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> define the shape of
            the curve.
            Provided the <var>x</var> values of <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var>
            lie within the range [0, 1] such a curve produces a function that is
            used to map input times (the <var>x</var> values) onto output times
            (the <var>y</var> values).
            This arrangement is illustrated below.

            <code>cubic-bezier( [ &lt;number&gt;{6} ; ]* &lt;number&gt;{4} )</code>

            (i.e. the curve starts at (0, 0); each segment is defined by six
            numbers where the start point is the end of the previous segment and
            the numbers define the two control points and the end point. The

            It is possible to scale a timed item's timing so that the timed item
            occurs in a series of discrete steps using a stepping function.

          <p>
            Some example step timing functions are illustrated below.

            The first row shows the function for each transition point when only

        <p>
          A <dfn>step timing function</dfn> is a type of <a>timing function</a>
          that divides the input time into a specified number of intervals that
          are equal in duration.
          The output time, starting at zero, rises by an amount equal to the
          interval duration once during each interval at the transition point
          which may be either the start, midpoint, or end of the interval.
        </p>
        <p>
          In keeping with Web Animations' model of endpoint exclusive
          interval timing (see <a href="#interval-timing"
          class="sectionRef"></a>), the output time at the transition point is
          the time <em>after</em> applying the increase (i.e. the top of the
          step) with the following exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a transition point coincides with the end of the <a>active
          interval</a> extra care must be taken to produce the correct result
          when performing a <a title="fill mode">fill</a>.
          To achieve this, when a <a>step timing function</a> is
          applied to a <a>timed item</a> or applied to an <a>animation
          effect</a> associated with a <a>timed item</a>, an additional
          <dfn>before flag</dfn> is passed.
          The value of the <a>before flag</a> is determined as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>If the <a>active time</a> of the timed item is null, the <a>before
              flag</a> is not set and these steps should be aborted.
          <li>Determine the <var>current direction</var> using the procedure
              defined in <a href="#calculating-the-directed-time"
              class="sectionRef"></a>.
          <li>If either the <var>current direction</var> is <span
              class="prop-value">forwards</span> or the <a>timed item playback
              rate</a> &ge; 0 (but <em>not</em> when both conditions are true),
              let <var>going forwards</var> be true, otherwise it is false.
          <li>The <a>before flag</a> is set if the timed item is in the
              <a>before phase</a> and <var>going forwards</var> is true;
              or if the timed item is in the <a>after phase</a> and <var>going
              forwards</var> is false.
        </ol>
        <p>
          When a step timing function is evaluated at a transition point, if
          the <a>before flag</a> is set the result is the value <em>before</em>
          applying the increase.

        The temporal relationship between a <a>child timed item</a> and its

        <h3>Relationship of group time to child time</h3>
        <p>
          The timing of the children of an <a>animation group</a> is based on
          the timing of the group.
          Specifically, times for the children are based on the parent's
          <a>transformed time</a>.
          With regards to repetition, this means the children operate
          <em>inside</em> an iteration of the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if an <a>animation group</a> has an <a>iteration
          count</a> of 2, then the children of of the group will all play twice
          since they effectively play <em>inside</em> the group's iterations.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/grouping-repetition.svg" width="600"
            alt="The effect of multiple iterations on the children of a group.">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Since children of an <a>animation group</a> base their timing on the
          group's <a>transformed time</a>, when the group repeats, the
          children play again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that even in this case, the child <a>timed items</a> still have
          only <em>one</em> <a>active interval</a>.
          However, as a result of the parent's timing, the <a>active
          interval</a> is played twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an <a>iteration count</a> is specified for the children of a group
          as well as for the group itself, the effect is as if the <a>iteration
          count</a> of the group was multiplied with the <a>iteration count</a>
          of the children.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">

            width="600" alt="Iteration counts are multiplicative.">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Specifying an <a>iteration count</a> of 2 on an <a>animation group</a>
          and an <a>iteration count</a> of 3 on one of its children results in
          that child playing 6 times.
        </p>
        <p>
          A further result of the children of an <a>animation group</a> basing
          their timing on the group's <a>transformed time</a> is that they
          cannot animate outside of the group's <a>active interval</a>.
          This is because the <a>transformed time</a> of a group will not
          change outside its <a>active interval</a>.
          This allows groups to <em>clip</em> the playback of their children.
        </p>

        <p class="caption">
          In the first instance, a <a>timed item</a> has a negative delay and an
          infinite <a>iteration count</a>.<br>
          However, when a similar <a>timed item</a> is placed inside
          an <a>animation group</a> with a specified <a>iteration duration</a>
          it has the effect of clipping the child <a>timed item</a>'s <a>active
          interval</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some further consequences of <a>animation group</a> children basing
          their timing on their parent group's <a>transformed time</a> are:

            Changing the <a>playback direction</a> of an <a>animation group</a>

            Specific types of <a>animation groups</a> can be used to provide

          turn following their order in the group.
          This sequencing is achieved by adjusting the <a

            The <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> of a <a>child

              the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> of subsequent
              children follows the usual behavior defined by IEEE 754-2008.
              As a result, if any of the children of an <a>animation

      <h2>Animation effects</h2>
      <p>
        An <dfn>animation effect</dfn> takes a <a>time fraction</a> and
        a <a>current iteration</a> value and uses them to calculate an
        <a>intermediate animation value</a> for its <a
        title="target property">target properties</a>.  Each <a>animation</a>
        may have at most one <a>animation effect</a> associated with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the result of an <a>animation effect</a> is based on the
        <a>time fraction</a> and <a>current iteration</a> value, it is updated
        whenever the timing model is <a title="sampling">sampled</a>.
        Note that changes to the timing model caused by using the <a
        href="#programming-interface">programming interface</a> do <em>not</em>
        cause the animation model (and hence <a>animation effects</a>) to be
        updated as described in <a
        href="#script-execution-and-live-updates-to-the-model"
        class="sectionRef"></a>.

      <section>
        <h3>Target properties</h3>
        <p>
          Each <a>animation effect</a> can have zero or more associated
          <dfn title="target property">target properties</dfn>.
        </p>
          <a title="target property">Target properties</a> may be CSS properties
          or DOM attributes.
          If a given <a>animation target</a> has an attribute with the same name
          as a CSS property, any <a>target property</a> is taken to refer to to
          the CSS property.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          If there ever exists a situation where we need to animate an attribute
          with the same name as a property (other than a <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/intro.html#TermPresentationAttribute">presentation
          attribute</a> [[SVG2]]) then we will need to introduce
          a disambiguation strategy. Generally, however, such naming should be
          avoided.

        <h3>Procedures for animating properties</h3>
        <p>
          In order to animate a <a>target property</a> the following procedures
          must be defined.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><dfn title="animation interpolation">interpolation</dfn> &mdash;
              given two target property values <var>V</var><sub>start</sub> and
              <var>V</var><sub>end</sub>, produces an intermediate value
              <var>V</var><sub>res</sub> at a distance of <var>p</var> along the
              interval between <var>V</var><sub>start</sub> and
              <var>V</var><sub>end</sub> such that
              <var>p</var> = 0 produces <var>V</var><sub>start</sub> and
              <var>p</var> = 1 produces <var>V</var><sub>end</sub>.
              The range of <var>p</var> is (&minus;&infin;, &infin;) due to the
              effect of <a>timing functions</a>.
              As a result, this procedure must also define extrapolation
              behavior for <var>p</var> outside [0, 1].
          <li><dfn title="animation addition">addition</dfn> &mdash; given two
              target property values
              <var>V</var><sub>a</sub> and <var>V</var><sub>b</sub> returns the
              sum of the two properties, <var>V</var><sub>result</sub>.
              For addition that is not commutative (for example, matrix
              multiplication) <var>V</var><sub>a</sub> represents the first term
              of the operation and <var>V</var><sub>b</sub> represents the
              second.
          <li><dfn>distance computation</dfn> &mdash; given two target property
              values <var>V</var><sub>start</sub> and
              <var>V</var><sub>end</sub> calculates some notion of scalar
              distance between the values, <var>distance</var>.
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          While <a title="animation addition">addition</a> can often be
          expressed in terms of the same weighted sum function used to define <a
          title="animation interpolation">interpolation</a>, this is not always
          the case.
          For example, interpolation of transform matrices involves
          decomposing and interpolating the matrix components whilst addition
          relies on matrix multiplication.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Specific animation behaviors</h3>
        <p>
          The specific procedures used for animating a given <a>target
          property</a> are referred to as the property's <dfn>animation
          behavior</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>animation behavior</a> of CSS properties is defined by the
          "Animatable:" line in the summary of the property's definition or in
          [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]] for properties that lack a such a line.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          The default <a>animation behavior</a> for CSS properties is "as
          string".  Should this be defined here or in CSS Animations Level 4?
        </p>
        <p>
          For DOM attributes, the <a>animation behavior</a> is defined alongside
          the attribute definition.
          Unlike CSS properties, if such a definition is not provided the
          default <a>animation behavior</a> is &ldquo;<a>not
          animatable</a>&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following is a series of pre-defined <a>animation behaviors</a>.
          [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]] provides further CSS-specific <a>animation
          behaviors</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <a>animation behaviors</a> that do not define a specific procedure
          for <a title="animation addition">addition</a> or which are defined as
          <dfn>not additive</dfn>, the <a
          title="animation addition">addition procedure</a> is simply
          <var>V</var><sub>res</sub> = <var>V</var><sub>b</sub>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <a>animation behaviors</a> that do not define a specific procedure
          for <a>distance computation</a> or which are defined as <dfn>not
          paceable</dfn>, the <a>distance computation</a> procedure is simply
          <var>distance</var> = 1.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>Not animatable</h4>
          <p>
            Some properties are specifically defined as <dfn>not
            animatable</dfn>.
            For example, properties defining animation parameters are <a>not
            animatable</a> since doing so would create complex recursive
            behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike other <a>animation behaviors</a>, no procedures for
            <a title="animation interpolation">interpolation</a>,
            <a title="animation addition">addition</a> and <a>distance
            computation</a> are defined for properties whose <a>animation
            behavior</a> is <a>not animatable</a> since these properties should
            not be modified.
          </p>
          <p>
            An <a>animation effect</a> that targets a property that is
            <a>not animatable</a> will still exhibit the usual behavior for
            a <a>timed item</a> such as occupying time in an <a>animation
            sequence</a>.
          </p>

            A <a>target property</a> that is <dfn>animatable as transform
            list</dfn> has the following <a>animation behavior</a>:

                Accumulation is defined in [[CSS3-TRANSFORMS]].
                <p>
                  However, when addition is performed for the purpose of
                  <a>accumulation</a>, the resulting transform list must be
                  collapsed to produce the same number and type of functions as
                  when calculating the <a>unaccumulated animation value</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, an animation effect that produces an
                  <a>intermediate animation value</a> consisting of a rotation
                  function and a translate function when the <a>current
                  iteration</a> is zero, should also produce a single rotation
                  function and a single translate function and in the same order
                  when producing the <a>intermediate animation value</a> for
                  values of <a>current iteration</a> greater than zero even when
                  the <a>accumulation operation</a> is <a

          <div class="issue">
            <p>
              For <a>distance computation</a> we previously defined it as
              follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Look only at the first component of the two lists
              <li>If both are translate &rarr; euclidean distance

              <li>If both are rotate &rarr; absolute difference
              <li>If both match but are something else &rarr; use linear
              <li>If they don't match &rarr; use matrix decomposition and
                  euclidean distance between translate components
            </ol>
            <p>
              This seems really arbitrary, especially part 5.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, looking at only the first component seems odd.
              Going through each component, working out the distance and then
              getting the square of the distance also seems much more consistent
              with what we do elsewhere.

          <h4>Other animation behaviors</h4>
          <p>
            The set of <a>animation behaviors</a> defined here may be extended
            by other specifications.
            For example, properties with using the &lt;image&gt; type are
            animated using the interpolation behavior defined in <a
            href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-images-4/#interpolation">CSS Image
            Values and Replaced Content</a>

          <div class="issue">
            <p>
              There are a bunch of CSS properties for which distance (and in
              some cases addition) is not defined or which need special
              handling.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example,
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>font-stretch (an enum but handled like an integer)
              <li>visibility (0 or 1 depending on if endpoints match or not)
              <li>flex-grow and flex-shrink which allow animation only if one of
                  the endpoints is 0)
              <li>value pairs, triples (use square distance)
              <li>rects (use square distance)
              <li>dash arrays (square distance but a bit weird due to
                               percentages)
              <li>shadows (square distance of components)
              <li>filters (undefined)
              <li>background-position (special list handling needed)
              <li>pair lists
            </ul>
            <p>
              Should we define these here or in the CSS Animation 4 spec?

        <h3>Intermediate animation values</h3>
        <p>
          Given a <a>time fraction</a>, a <a>current iteration</a>, and an
          <a>underlying value</a>, an <a>animation effect</a> produces
          an <dfn>intermediate animation value</dfn> for each <a>animatable</a>
          <a>target property</a>.
          Before being applied to the <a title="target property">target
          properties</a>,
          these <a>intermediate animation values</a> are composed together using
          the process defined in <a href="#combining-animations"
          class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An <a>intermediate animation value</a> is established by first
          calculating an <a>unaccumulated animation value</a> and then applying
          <a>accumulation</a> behavior.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Unaccumulated animation values</h3>
          <p>
            The <dfn>unaccumulated animation value</dfn> is the result of
            evaluating an <a>animation effect</a> for a given <a>target
            property</a>, <a>time fraction</a> and <a>underlying value</a>
            <em>independent</em> of the <a>current iteration</a>.
            The procedure for calculating this value depends on the specific
            type of <a>animation effect</a> and is defined subsequently (see <a
            href="#the-unaccumulated-animation-value-of-a-keyframe-animation-effect"

            <a>Animation effects</a> may be defined such that as the
            <a>animation</a> that is applying them <a
            href="#repeating">repeats</a>, the <a>intermediate animation
            value</a> builds on the value produced by previous iterations.
            This behavior is called <dfn>accumulation</dfn>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a>accumulation</a> behavior of an <a>animation effect</a> is
            specified by the <a>animation effect</a>'s <dfn>accumulation
            operation</dfn> property.
            The <a>accumulation operation</a> property takes one of the
            following two values.

            <dt><dfn title="accumulation operation sum">sum</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                The <a>intermediate animation value</a> produced by the
                <a>animation effect</a> for a given property is the sum (as
                calculated using the <a title="animation addition">addition</a>
                procedure of the <a>target property</a>) of the <a>unaccumulated
                animation value</a> for the given <a>time fraction</a> and the
                final <a>intermediate animation value</a> of the previous
                iteration (i.e. the result of evaluating the <a>intermediate
                animation value</a> with a <a>time fraction</a> of 1, and
                a <a>current iteration</a> of <code><a>current iteration</a>
                - 1</code>).
              </p>
              <p>
                If the <a>current iteration</a> is zero, the <a>intermediate
                animation value</a> is just the <a>unaccumulated animation
                value</a>.

      <h2>Combining animations</h2>
      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          After calculating the <a>intermediate animation values</a> for an
          <a>animation effect</a> they are applied to the <a>animation
          effect</a>'s <a title="target property">target properties</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since it is possible for multiple <a>in effect</a> <a
          title="animation">animations</a> to target the same property it is
          often necessary to combine the results of several <a>animation
          effects</a> together.
          This process is called <em>compositing</em> and is based on
          establishing an <a>animation stack</a> for each property targetted by
          an <a>in effect</a> <a>animation effect</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After compositing the results of <a>animation
          effects</a> together, the composited result is combined with other
          values specified for the <a>target property</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a CSS <a>target property</a> the arrangement is illustrated below:
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/animation-cascade.svg" width="450"

          The results of <a>animation effects</a> targetting the same property
          are composited together using an <a>animation stack</a>.<br>
          The result of this composition is written to an animation stylesheet
          that is more important than other stylesheets but less than any
          <code>!important</code> rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <a>target property</a> that specifies a DOM attribute, the
          composited result is combined with the value of the attribute
          specified in the DOM or the lacuna value for that attribute if it is
          not specified.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first part of this operation&mdash;combining <a>intermediate
          animation values</a> that target the same <a

          determine both
          <em>how</em> the <a>animation effects</a>
          associated with the <a>animations</a> are combined
          with one another,
          as well as the <em>order</em> in which they are applied, that is,
          their relative <em>priority</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The matter of <em>how</em> <a>intermediate animation values</a> are
          combined is governed by the <a>composition operation</a> of
          the corresponding <a>animation effects</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relative <em>priority</em> of <a>intermediate animation values</a>
          is determined by an <a>animation stack</a> established for each
          animated property.

        <p>
          The relative priority of any two <a>animation

        <ol>

              associated.
          <li>Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> by applying the following
              conditions in turn until the order is resolved,
            <ol>
              <li>Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> using any <a>custom

              <li>Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> by the <a>player start
                  time</a> of the <var>associated player</var> of each of

              <li>Sort by the <a>player sequence number</a> so that lower
                  sequence numbers sort first.
              <li>Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> in <a>tree order</a>.
                  (By this point, <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> must have the

          <h3>The custom animation priority</h3>
          <p>
            Each <a>animation effect</a> has an associated numeric
            <dfn>custom animation priority</dfn> that is used to provide
            high-level control of animation priority for specifications layered
            on top of Web Animations.
            The initial value of the <a>custom animation priority</a> is zero.

            <p>
              Note that the <a>custom animation priority</a> is primarily
              intended to be used to prioritize animation effects at
              a high-level, such as to prioritize animations <em>by type</em>.
              For example, it can be used to ensure that CSS Animations always

              It is possible to control animation priority at a lower-level by

        <h3>Calculating the result of an animation stack</h3>
        <p>
          In order to calculate the final value of an <a>animation stack</a>,
          the <a>intermediate animation values</a> of each
          <a>animation effect</a> in the stack are combined in order of priority
          from lowest to highest priority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each step in the process of evaluating an <a>animation stack</a> takes
          an <dfn>underlying value</dfn> as input.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each <a>animation effect</a> in the stack, the appropriate
          <a>intermediate animation value</a> from the <a>animation effect</a>
          is combined with the <a>underlying value</a> to produce a new value.
          This resulting value becomes the <a>underlying value</a> for combining
          the next <a>animation effect</a> in the stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final value of an <a>animation stack</a>, called the
          <dfn>composited value</dfn>, is simply the result of combining the
          <a>intermediate animation value</a> of the final (highest priority)
          <a>animation effect</a> in the stack with the <a>underlying value</a>

        <h3>Animation composition</h3>
        <p>
          The specific operation used to combine an <a>intermediate animation
          value</a> with an <a>underlying value</a> is determined by the
          <dfn>composition operation</dfn> of the <a>animation effect</a> that
          produced the <a>intermediate animation value</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification defines two <a>composition operations</a> as
          follows:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><dfn title="composition operation replace">replace</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            The result of compositing the <a>intermediate animation value</a>
            with the <a>underlying value</a> is simply the <a>intermediate
            animation value</a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn title="composition operation add">add</dfn></dt>

              value</a>.
              For <a>animation behaviors</a> where the
              <a title="animation addition">addition operation</a> is defined
              such that it is not commutative, the order of the operands is
              <code><a>underlying value</a> + <a>intermediate animation

        <h3>Applying the composited result</h3>
        <p>
          The process for a applying a <a>composited value</a> depends on if the
          <a>target property</a> refers to a CSS property or a DOM attribute.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>Applying the result to a CSS property</h4>
          <p>
            Applying a <a>composited value</a> to a CSS <a>target property</a>
            depends on establishing an <a>animation stylesheet</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <dfn>animation stylesheet</dfn> contains
            <a title="composited value">composited animation values</a>
            and acts with a higher priority than all other stylesheets.
            However, <code>!important</code> rules from all other stylesheets
            act with a higher priority than the <a>animation stylesheet</a>.
            The <a>animation stylesheet</a> is regenerated each time the
            <a>animation model</a> is updated (see <a href="#animation-effects"
            class="sectionRef"></a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a>composited value</a> calculated for a CSS <a>target
            property</a> is applied using the following process.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Calculate the <var>base value</var> of the property as
                the value generated for that property by computing the <a
                href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#used-value">used
                value</a> [[!CSS21]] for that property in the absence of the
                <a>animation stylesheet</a>.
            <li>Establish the <a>animation stack</a> for the property (see <a
                href="#the-animation-stack" class="sectionRef"></a>).</li>
            <li>Calculate the <a>composited value</a> of the <a>animation
                stack</a> passing in the <var>base value</var> of the property
                as the initial <a>underlying value</a> (see <a
                href="#calculating-the-result-of-an-animation-stack"
                class="sectionRef"></a>).
            <li>Insert the <a>composited value</a> into the <a>animation
                stylesheet</a>.
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Applying the composited result to a DOM attribute</h4>
          <p>
            DOM attributes are, unless otherwise specified, <a>not
            animatable</a>.
            For each attribute that has a specific <a>animation behavior</a>
            associated with it, an attribute value to use when the attribute is
            not specified or in error must be defined, referred to as the
            <dfn>lacuna value</dfn>.
            For example, SVG2 ([[SVG2]]) defines <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/intro.html#TermLacunaValue">lacunae
            values</a> for its attributes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a>composited value</a> calculated for a DOM attribute <a>target
            property</a> is applied using the following process.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Let the <var>base value</var> of the property be the value
                specified for attribute in the DOM or,
                if the attribute value is not specified in the DOM, the
                <a>lacuna value</a> for that attribute.
            <li>Establish the <a>animation stack</a> for the property (see <a
                href="#the-animation-stack" class="sectionRef"></a>).</li>
            <li>Calculate the <a>composited value</a> of the <a>animation
                stack</a> passing in the <var>base value</var> of the attribute
                as the initial <a>underlying value</a> (see <a
                href="#calculating-the-result-of-an-animation-stack"
                class="sectionRef"></a>).</li>
            <li>Record the <a>composited value</a> as the <dfn>animated
                attribute value</dfn> of the attribute.
          </ol>
          <p>
            The <a>animated attribute value</a> does not replace the value of
            the attribute in the DOM although it may be accessible via some
            other interface.
            For all intents and purposes other than interaction with DOM
            interfaces, user agents must treat the <a>animated attribute
            value</a> as the attribute value.

      <h2>Keyframe animation effects</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>keyframe animation effect</dfn> is an <a>animation effect</a>
        that produces <a>intermediate animation values</a> for its <a>target
        properties</a> by interpolating between a series of property values
        positioned at fractional offsets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each set of property values indexed by an offset is called
        a <dfn>keyframe</dfn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn title="keyframe offset">offset of a keyframe</dfn> is a value
        in the range [0, 1] or the special value null.
        The list of <a>keyframes</a> for a <a>keyframe animation effect</a> is
        <dfn>loosely sorted by offset</dfn> which means that for each
        <a>keyframe</a> in the list that has a <a>keyframe offset</a> that is
        not null, the offset is greater than or equal to the offset of the
        previous <a>keyframe</a> in the list with a <a>keyframe offset</a> that
        is not null, if any.
      </p>
      <p>
        The behavior when <a>keyframes</a> overlap or have unsupported values
        is defined in <a
        href="#the-unaccumulated-animation-value-of-a-keyframe-animation-effect"
        class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each keyframe also has a <a>timing function</a> associated with it
        that is applied to the period of time between the keyframe on which it
        is specified and the <em>next</em> keyframe in the list.
        The <a>timing function</a> specified on the last keyframe in the
        list is never applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the <a>composition operation</a> specified on the
        <a>animation effect</a>, each <a>keyframe</a> may also have an
        associated <a>composition operation</a> that is applied to all values
        specified in that <a>keyframe</a>.
        If no <a>composition operation</a> is specified for a <a>keyframe</a>,
        the <a>composition operation</a> specified for the <a>animation
        effect</a> is used.

        <h3>Spacing keyframes</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            It is often useful to be able to provide a series of property values
            without having calculate the <a>keyframe offset</a> of each value in
            time but instead to rely on some automatic spacing.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, rather than typing:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate([ { color: 'blue', offset: 0 },
               { color: 'green', offset: 1/3 },
               { color: 'red', offset: 2/3 },
               { color: 'yellow', offset: 1 } ], 2);
          </pre>
          <p>
            It should be possible to type the following and allow the user agent
            to calculate the <a title="keyframe offset">offset</a> of each
            keyframe:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate([ { color: 'blue' },
               { color: 'green' },
               { color: 'red' },
               { color: 'yellow' } ], 2);
          </pre>
          <p>
            Web Animations provides spacing modes for this purpose. The default
            spacing mode for keyframe animation effects is
            &ldquo;<a
            title="distribute keyframe spacing mode">distribute</a>&rdquo; which
            produces the result described above.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other spacing mode, &ldquo;<a
            title="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</a>&rdquo;, is useful when
            it is desirable to maintain an even rate of change such as for <a
            href="#motion-path-animation-effects">motion path animation</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, consider the following animation:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate([ { left: '0px' },
               { left: '-20px' },
               { left: '100px' },
               { left: '50px' } ], 1);
          </pre>
          <p>
            The resulting value of the <span class="prop-name">left</span>
            property is illustrated below:
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/spacing-distribute.svg" width="350"
              alt="The animated value of the left property over time when applying the distribute spacing mode.
The values are evenly spaced in time but the rate of change differs for each segment as indicated the varying slope of the graph.">

          <p class="caption">
            The animated value of the left property over time when applying the

            The values are evenly spaced in time but the rate of change differs
            for each segment as indicated the varying slope of the graph.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can use the <a title="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</a>
            spacing mode as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate(
  new KeyframeEffect([ { left: '0px' },
                       { left: '-20px' },
                       { left: '100px' },
                       { left: '50px' } ], { spacing: "paced" }), 1);
          </pre>
          <p>
            The result is illustrated below:
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/spacing-paced.svg" width="350"
              alt="The animated value of the left property over time when applying the paced spacing mode.
The absolute value of the slope is graph is equal for all segments of the animation indicating a constant rate of change.">

            of the animation indicating a constant rate of change.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also possible to combine fixed <a>keyframe offsets</a> with
            spacing modes as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate(
  new KeyframeEffect([ { left: '0px' },
                       { left: '-20px' },
                       { left: '100px', offset: 0.5 },
                       { left: '50px' } ], { spacing: "paced" }), 1);
          </pre>

        <p>
          Before calculating animation values from a <a>keyframe animation
          effect</a>, an absolute value must be computed for the <a>keyframe
          offset</a> of each <a>keyframe</a> with a null offset.
          The values computed depend on the <dfn>keyframe spacing mode</dfn>
          specified for the <a>keyframe animation effect</a>.
          The keyframe spacing modes are:
        </p>

            null are positioned so that the difference between subsequent

            null are positioned so that the <em>distance</em> between subsequent

            The distance is calculated using the <a>distance computation</a>

              It attempts to cover all possible combinations of input where
              keyframe offsets and or paced property values may be missing.
              Furthermore, it attempts to do this in a way that degenerates
              consistently and also allows the author to combine fixed offsets
              with either pacing or distribute spacing.

            In the presence of certain timing functions, the input time
            fraction to an animation effect is not limited to the range [0, 1].
            Currently, however, keyframe offsets <em>are</em> limited to the
            range [0, 1] and property values are simply extrapolated for input
            time fractions outside this range.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have considered removing this restriction since some cases exist
            where it is useful to be able to specify non-linear
            changes in property values at time fractions outside the range
            [0, 1].
            One example is an animation that interpolates from green to yellow
            but has an overshoot timing function that makes it temporarily
            interpolate &lsquo;beyond&rsquo; yellow to red before settling back
            to yellow.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this effect could be achieved by modification of the keyframes
            and timing function, this approach seems to break the model's
            separation of timing concerns from animation effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not clear how this effect should be achieved but we note that
            allowing keyframe offsets outside [0, 1] may make the currently
            specified behavior where keyframes at offset 0 and 1 are synthesized
            as necessary, inconsistent.

      <h2>Motion path animation effects</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>motion path animation effect</dfn> is an <a>animation effect</a>
        that produces <a>animation values</a> for the transform <a>target
        property</a> of an <a>animation target</a> such that it follows
        a geometric curve commonly referred to as a &ldquo;motion path&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>motion path</dfn> of a <a>motion path animation effect</a> is
        defined by an SVG Path, as specified by SVG [[!SVG2]].
        A <a>motion path</a> consists of a list of <dfn
        title="path command">path commands</dfn> (see <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/paths.html#PathData">path data</a>
        [[!SVG2]]).
      </p>
      <p>
        Amongst the different types of path commands, we define
        <dfn title="orientation path command">orientation path commands</dfn> as
        <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/paths.html#PathDataMovetoCommands">moveto</a>
        commands and <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/paths.html#PathDataBearingCommands">bearing</a>
        commands.
        All types of path commands that are <em>not</em> <a>orientation
        path commands</a> are referred to as <dfn
        title="drawing path command">drawing path commands</dfn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>automatic rotation flag</dfn> of a <a>motion path animation
        effect</a>, if set, specifies that the <a>unaccumulated animation
        value</a> generated by the <a>motion path animation effect</a> produces
        a rotation that matches the directional tangent vector of the
        <a>motion path</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>rotation angle</dfn> parameter of a <a>motion path animation
        effect</a> specifies a constant rotation that applies to the target
        transform in addition to any rotation generated by setting the
        <a>automatic rotation flag</a>.

                    For continuous <a>path commands</a> (all elements except
                    moveto), the angle of the tangent vector for the purpose of
                    these calculations is defined to be an integer multiple of
                    2&pi; different from the value given by <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_angle">standard
                    mathematical formulae for tangents to curves in
                    2 dimensional space</a>.
                 <li>
                   For moveto <a>path commands</a>, which are discontinuous, the
                   angle of the tangent vector for the purpose of these
                   calculations is always an integer multiple of 2&pi;.
                 <li>
                   The initial value of the angle of the tangent vector is
                   computed using the first element of the curve, and is always
                   in the range [0, 2&pi;).
                 <li>
                   Single continuous path commands must never produce tangent
                   vector angles that are discontinuous over their defined
                   region. This implies that a single unique solution is
                   available for all points on continuous path commands.

                   When computing angles after discontinuous or non-smooth
                   jumps, multiple possible solutions may be available.  These
                   solutions will differ by integer multiples of 2&pi;.  In
                   such cases the solution that lies closest to the previous

      <h3>Custom effects</h3>
      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          In some situations the <a>animation
          effects</a> provided by Web Animations may be insufficient.
          For example, the <a>animation effects</a>
          defined here are only able to target certain CSS properties.
          They are unable, therefore, to modify the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#__svg__SVGSVGElement__currentScale"><code>currentScale</code></a>
          property of an SVG element to smoothly zoom the viewport without
          affecting the document content.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such cases, where the provided <a>animation
          effects</a> do not provide needed functionality, an effect defined by
          script may be used.
          Such <a>custom effects</a> receive a <a>time
          fraction</a> and <a>current iteration</a> from the timing model and
          are responsible for producing an effect corresponding to the specified
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using an effect defined in script it is possible to animate not only
          otherwise un-animatable attributes and properties, but potentially
          anything that is accessible via script, including even producing audio
          or creating vibrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, using a <a>custom effect</a> that draws to a <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-canvas-element"><code>canvas</code></a>
          element, it is possible to produce a complex animated effect
          featuring patterns that may be difficult to create using CSS or
          SVG.
          Compared to using the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/">WindowAnimationTiming</a>
          interface, this approach ensures the animation is frame-rate
          independent and can be paused, reversed, eased with timing effects,
          accelerated, synchronized with other animations, and be controlled
          in the same manner as any other Web Animations animation without any
          additional programming.
        </p>
      </div> <!-- informative -->
      <p>
        A <dfn>custom effect</dfn> is an author-defined programming callback
        that is passed timing information whenever a <a>sample</a> is performed.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h4>Execution order of custom effects</h4>
        <p>
          Since <a>custom effects</a>, unlike <a
          title="animation effect">animation effects</a>, are not limited to
          a single <a>target property</a>, the steps for assessing their
          order of execution differs from <a>animation effects</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>Custom effects</a> are executed after all
          <a>animation effects</a> have completed and
          applied their result to their targets (see <a
          href="#applying-the-composited-result" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Need to define this more precisely.
          Are styles flushed?
          Presumably they are.
          Can we suspend reflow for the duration of executing the script-based
          animation effects and just do it once afterwards?
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the set of <a>custom effects</a>, the
          order of execution is the same as that defined for <a title="animation
          effect">animation effects</a> in <a href="#the-animation-stack"

          Items sorted earlier are executed before those sorted later.

      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          In addition to the abstract model described above, Web Animations also
          defines a programming interface to the model.
          This interface can be used to inspect and extend animations produced

                    such as <code>"3s"</code> should be allowed (and allowing
                    them makes walking the tree more complex).
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, it separates "specified" timing from "computed" timing
                which some consider advantageous.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only situation where calculated values and input values
                differ is for <code>duration</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                One alternative that has been proposed is to introduce
                a <code>Duration</code> interface as follows:
              </p>
              <pre class="example webidl">
interface TimedItem {
   // Timing
   attribute double   delay;
   attribute FillMode fill;
   attribute Duration duration;
   attribute double   playbackRate;
   // ...
   
   // Scheduled time
   readonly attribute double              startTime;
   readonly attribute unrestricted double endTime;
};

interface Duration {
  double    sec;
  DOMString string;
}
              </pre>
              <p>
                Usage is as follows:
              </p>
              <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
 var specifiedDur  = anim.duration.string; // "auto"
 var calculatedDur = anim.duration.sec; // 5
 
 // Update duration to 3s
 anim.duration.sec = 3;
 // anim.duration.string -&gt; "3s"
 
 // Update duration to 3s (alt.)
 anim.duration.string = "3s";
 // anim.duration.sec -&gt; 3
 
 // Reset to auto
 anim.duration.string = "auto";  
 // anim.duration.sec -&gt; 5
              </pre>

          <h4>Creating a new <code>Animation</code> object</h4>
          <p>
            The <a>Animation</a> constructor offers a number of approaches to
            creating a new <a>Animation</a> object.
            At its simplest, an <a>Animation</a> object that changes the
            &lsquo;left&rsquo; property of <var>elem</var> to 100 over three
            seconds can be achieved as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p>
            The second parameter, representing the <a>animation effect</a>, may
            specify multiple properties, an <a>AnimationEffect</a> object, or
            even a callback function.
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
// Specify multiple properties at once
var animA = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px', top: '300px' }, 3);

// Specify multiple frames
var animB = new Animation(elem, [ { left: '100px' }, { left: '300px' } ], 3);

// Share the animation effect of another animation
var animC = new Animation(elem, animB.effect, 3);

// Supply a specialized animation effect
var animD =
  new Animation(elem, new MotionPathEffect("M100 250C100 50 400 50 400 250"), 3);

// Supply a custom script-based animation effect
var animE = new Animation(elem, function(time) { 
    // (Normally we should check for time===null, but in this case it produces
    //  the correct result anyway)
    document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0 + time * 2.0;
  }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p>
            The third parameter representing the animation's timing, may
            simply be a number representing the <a>iteration duration</a> as
            above, or, to specify further timing properties such as the <a
            title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a>,
            a <a>TimingInput</a> object can be used as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim =
  new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, { duration: 3, playbackRate: 2 });
          </pre>
          <p>
            It is also possible to omit the timing parameter altogether in which
            case default timing values will be used.
            Since the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> of an <a>animation</a>
            is zero, and the default <code>fill</code> when constructing an
            <a>Animation</a> is <span class="prop-value">forwards</span>, it is
            possible to create animations that simply set a property without
            any interpolation as follows,
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
new Animation(elem, { display: 'none' });
          </pre>
          <p>
            This is particularly useful in combination with other <a
            title="animation">animations</a> or <a>timed
            items</a>.
            For example, fading an element before switching
            &lsquo;display&rsquo; to &lsquo;none&rsquo; can be achieved as
            follows,
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
new AnimationSequence(
  [
    new Animation(elem, { opacity: '0%' }, 1),
    new Animation(elem, { display: 'none' })
  ]
);
          </pre>
          <p>
            Having created an <a title="Animation interface">Animation</a>, it
            can be played using
            <code>document.timeline.play(<var>anim</var>)</code>.
            For simple effects, the <a
            href="#extensions-to-the-element-interface"><code>Element.animate</code></a>
            shortcut is more convenient since it performs this last step
            automatically. For example,
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate({ left: '100px' }, 3);

          <h4>Normalizing a <code>Keyframe</code> object</h4>
          <div class="note">
            <p>
              Since accessing the properties of an ECMAScript user object can
              have side effects, the manner in which these properties is
              accessed is important.
              In light of this consideration the procedure for normalizing
              a <a title="Keyframe interface">Keyframe</a> object has the
              following properties:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each property that is read, is read only once.</li>
              <li>Properties are read in a well-defined order.</li>
              <li>Properties corresponding to unsupported target properties or
                  attributes are not read.</li>
            </ul>

            A <a title="Keyframe interface">Keyframe</a> object, <var>keyframe

          <ol>
            <li>Let the initial <a>keyframe offset</a>
                of <var>keyframe result</var> be <code>null</code>.
            <li>Let the initial <a>composition operation</a>
                of <var>keyframe result</var> be <code>null</code>.
            <li>Create a list, <var>supported properties</var>, of property
                names and attribute names that can be animated by the
                implementation.

            <li>Let <var>animation properties</var> be an empty sequence.
            <li>Iterate over the properties of <var>keyframe input</var>.

        <h2>Script execution and live updates to the model</h2>
        <p>
          The interaction between script execution and the state of
          the model is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Changes made to the Web Animations model via the programming
              interface are reflected immediately in the values returned by the
              interfaces defined in this specification.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, methods that operate on the current state of the model
              such as pausing or reversing are applied to a fully-updated timing
              model, that is, after all previous modifications have been
              incorporated.
            </p>
            <div class="informative">
              <p>
                For example, if the <a>AnimationPlayer</a>
                associated with an
                <a title="Animation interface">Animation</a>'s is <a
                title="seeking">seeked</a> via the API,
                the value returned when querying the
                animation's <code>startTime</code> will reflect updated state of
                the model immediately.
              </p>
              <pre class="example sh_javascript">
                // Initially anim's startTime is 3
                anim.player.currentTime += 2;
                alert(anim.startTime); // Displays '5'
              </pre>
              <p>
                The same concept applies to more complex modifications of the
                Web Animations model such as adding and removing children from
                a <a>AnimationGroup</a>.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Modifications to the model using the programming interface do not
              cause the properties of the animation target to be updated and nor
              is any <a>CustomEffect</a> called until the next sample has been
              performed at some time after the current script block completes
              execution.
            </p>
            <div class="informative">
              <p>
                For example, if the used style of an element is queried
                immediately after applying a new <a>Animation</a> to that
                element, the result of the new animation will <em>not</em> be
                incorporated in the value returned.
              </p>

            </div>
            <p class="issue">
              I'm unsure if this is the desired behavior for actions such as
              <a>seeking</a> and <code>play()</code> (and thus
              <code>animate()</code>).
              Gecko, for example, forces a synchronous sample when a seek is
              performed.
              This certainly makes testing simpler but I'm not sure if this is
              a good idea or not.

            <div class="informative">
              <p>

            <p class="issue">
              We may introduce timelines that can be started programmatically
              (e.g. for SVG).
              In such a case, the <code>currentTime</code> should probably
              become zero <em>immediately</em> which would violate this
              condition.
              If we do indeed want that then we should probably spec it to force
              a synchronous sample at that point and note it as an exception
              here.

      <h2>Integration with Media Fragments</h2>
      <p>
        The Media Fragments specification [[!MEDIA-FRAGMENTS]] defines a means
        for addressing a temporal range of a media resource.
        The application of media fragments depends on the MIME type of the
        resource on which they are specified.
        For resources with the <a class="externalDFN"
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#MIMEType">SVG MIME type</a>
        [[!SVG11]], the application of temporal parameters is defined in the <a
        href="animation-elements.html">Animation elements</a> specification.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note that media fragments are defined to operate on resources based on
        their MIME type.
        As a result, temporal addressing may not be supported in all situations
        where Web Animations content is used.

      <h2>Implementation requirements</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Precision of time values</h3>
        <p>
          The internal representation of time values is implementation dependant
          however, it is RECOMMENDED that user agents be able to represent input
          time values with microsecond precision so that 0.000001 is
          distinguishable from 0.0.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Conformance criteria</h3>
        <p>
          This specification defines an abstract model for animation and, as
          such, for user agents that do not support scripting, there are no
          conformance criteria since there is no testable surface area.
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents that do not support scripting, however, may implement
          additional technologies defined in terms of this specification in
          which case the definitions provided in this specification will form
          part of the conformance criteria of the additional technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>conforming scripted Web Animations user agent</dfn> is a user
          agent that implements the <abbr
          title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> defined in <a
          href="#programming-interface" class="sectionRef"></a> including
          dispatching events as defined in <a href="#player-events"
          class="sectionRef"></a>.

      <h2>Changes since last publication</h2>
      <p>
        The following changes have been made since the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/">25 June
          2013 Working Draft</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Altered the <a>zero time</a> for the <a>document timeline</a> to
            correspond to the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/#dom-performancetiming-navigationstart"><code>navigationStart</code></a>
            moment defined by [[!NAVIGATION-TIMING]].
        <li>Altered the definition of <a>effective current time</a>.
        <li>Renamed &lsquo;time drift&rsquo; to <a>time lag</a> and exposed the
            time lag in the <a>AnimationPlayer</a> interface of
            the <a href="#programming-interface">programming interface</a>.
        <li>Introduced <a title="limited">limiting</a> behavior to players so
            that the <a>current time</a> behaves more like a DVD or cassette
            player.
        <li>Removed timing events and added <a>player events</a> instead.
        <li>Introduced an <a>end delay</a> property to timed items.
        <li>Reworked the description of <a
            href="#timed-item-phases-and-states">timed item states</a> to
            include phases as well.
            Renamed the &lsquo;active&rsquo; state to the <a>in play</a> state.
        <li>Changed the behavior of <a>fill modes</a> so that children
            that are clipped part-way through their <a>active interval</a> by
            a <a>parent animation group</a> only fill if they have the
            corresponding <a>fill mode</a> set.
        <li>Fixed a bug in the calculation of the <a>current iteration</a> for
            zero-length iteration durations (<a
            href="#calculating-the-current-iteration"
            class="sectionRef"></a>).
        <li>Added extra wording so that a <a>timed item</a> with a
            <a>step timing function</a> whose transition point coincides with
            either end of the <a>active interval</a> produces the expected value
            when <a title="fill mode">filling</a>.
        <li>Fixed a bug in the calculation of the <a>transformed time</a> so
            that children of groups with infinite duration will play.
        <li>Fixed a bug in the calculation of the <a>time fraction</a> for
            zero-length iteration durations (<a
            href="#calculating-the-time-fraction" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        <li>Clarified behavior in a number of cases where a value of infinity
            may be multiplied with zero.
        <li>Renamed timing groups, <a>animation groups</a>. Parallel timing
            groups are now simply <a>animation groups</a>, and sequence timing
            groups are now <a>animation sequences</a>.
        <li>Rewrote and re-organized most of the animation model section (see <a
            href="#animation-model" class="sectionRef"></a>) to provide greater
            internal consistency.
            CSS properties are now animatable by default and procedures for
            <a title="animation interpolation">interpolation</a>,
            <a title="animation addition">addition</a>, and <a>distance
            computation</a> are now defined for all cases
            (see <a href="#procedures-for-animating-properties"
            class="sectionRef"></a>).
        <li>Renamed the <em>target element</em> of an <a>animation</a> to the
            <a>animation target</a>.
        <li>Made the <a>composition operation</a> a property of all
            <a>animation effects</a>.
        <li>Added per-<a>keyframe</a> <a>timing functions</a>.
        <li>Replaced paced timing functions with <a
            href="#spacing-keyframes">spacing</a> behavior that can either
            evenly distribute values or space them to maintain an even rate of
            change.
        <li>Added <a title="motion path spacing mode">spacing modes</a>,
            <a>spacing points</a>, and <a>point offsets</a> to <a>motion path
            animation effects</a> in order to support all the features of SVG's
            <code>animateMotion</code> element.
        <li>Removed custom effect priorities.
        <li>Renamed the <code>Timeline</code> interface to
            <a>AnimationTimeline</a>.
        <li>Renamed <code>getCurrentPlayers</code> on the
            <a>AnimationTimeline</a> interface to
            <code>getAnimationPlayers</code>.
        <li>Renamed <code>Player</code> interface to <a>AnimationPlayer</a>.
        <li>Added <code>onfinish</code> to the <a>AnimationPlayer</a> interface
            as the event handler for the new <a>finish player event</a> and made
            the <a>AnimationPlayer</a> interface inherit from
            <code>EventTarget</code>.
        <li>Added the following members to the <a>AnimationPlayer</a> interface:
            <ul>
              <li><code>finished</code>
              <li><code>cancel()</code>
              <li><code>finish()</code>
              <li><code>play()</code>
              <li><code>pause()</code>
              <li><code>reverse()</code>
            </ul>
        <li>Made the <code>paused</code> member of the <a>AnimationPlayer</a>
            interface readonly.
        <li>Removed the event handlers from <a>TimedItem</a> since timing events
            have been replaced with <a>player events</a>.
            Similarly, made the <a>TimedItem</a> interface no longer inherit
            from <code>EventTarget</code>.
        <li>Renamed the following members of the <a>Timing</a> interface and
            <a>TimingInput</a> dictionary:
            <ul>
              <li><code>iterationDuration</code> &rarr; <code>duration</code>
              <li><code>startDelay</code> &rarr; <code>delay</code>
              <li><code>fillMode</code> &rarr; <code>fill</code>
              <li><code>iterationCount</code> &rarr; <code>iterations</code>
              <li><code>timingFunction</code> &rarr; <code>easing</code>
            </ul>
        <li>Removed the <code>activeDuration</code> member of the
            <a>TimingInput</a> dictionary and <a>Timing</a> interface and
            introduced <code>endDelay</code> to both.
        <li>Introduced an <span class="prop-value">auto</span> value for
            <a>FillMode</a> and made it the default value for <code>fill</code>
            on <a>TimingInput</a>.
        <li>Added <a>timing function</a> syntax directly to this specification
            rather than referring to [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]].
        <li>Removed the abstract <code>TimingGroup</code> interface and
            renamed <code>ParGroup</code> to <a>AnimationGroup</a>.
        <li>Renamed <code>SeqGroup</code> to <a>AnimationSequence</a> and made
            it inherit from <a>AnimationGroup</a>.
        <li>Removed <code>null</code> as a possible value for the
            <em>timing</em> parameter of the <a>AnimationGroup</a>,
            <a>AnimationSequence</a>
            and <a title="Animation interface">Animation</a> constructors and
            the <code><a>Animatable</a>.animate</code> method.
        <li>Made the <code>target</code> member of the <a
            title="Animation interface">Animation</a> interface no longer
            readonly.
        <li>Removed the <code>AnimationTarget</code> typedef and introduced the
            <a>Animatable</a> interface in its place.
        <li>Made <code><a>Animatable</a>.animate</code> return an
            <a>AnimationPlayer</a> instead of an <a
            title="Animation interface">Animation</a>.
        <li>Moved the <code>composite</code> member of <a>KeyframeEffect</a>
            and <a>MotionPathEffect</a> to the base class,
            <a>AnimationEffect</a>.
        <li>Renamed <code>KeyframeAnimationEffect</code> to
            <a>KeyframeEffect</a>.
        <li>Changed the constructor for <a>KeyframeEffect</a> to take
            a <a>KeyframeEffectOptions</a> dictionary object.
        <li>Added a <code>spacing</code> member to both
            <a>KeyframeEffect</a> and <a>KeyframeEffectOptions</a> to specify <a
            href="#spacing-keyframes">spacing</a> behavior.
        <li>Made <code>getFrames</code> on <a>KeyframeEffect</a> return the
            computed <a>keyframe offset</a> as <code>computedOffset</code> and
            apply the normalization of keyframes defined in <a
            href="#normalizing-a-list-of-keyframes" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        <li>Made the normalization of keyframes no longer fill in the
            <a>keyframe offset</a> of a keyframe.
            This is now incorporated in <a href="#spacing-keyframes"
            class="sectionRef"></a> which is now a core part of the model.
        <li>Made the normalization of keyframes sort keyframes if all
            <a>keyframe offset</a> are specified or otherwise throw an exception
            if the frames are not <a>loosely sorted by offset</a> and not all
            offsets are specified since the desired result in this case is
            ambiguous.
        <li>Added the <code>easing</code> member to the <a
              title="Keyframe interface">Keyframe</a> dictionary.
        <li>Renamed path animation effects to <a>motion path animation
            effects</a> and likewise <code>PathAnimationEffect</code> to
            <a>MotionPathEffect</a>.
        <li>Changed the constructor for <a>MotionPathEffect</a> to take
            a <a>MotionPathEffectOptions</a> dictionary object.
        <li>Added the <code>spacing</code> member to the
            <a>MotionPathEffect</a> interface.
        <li>Replaced the <code>CustomEffect</code> callback interface with the
            <a>EffectCallback</a> callback function and replaced the
            <code>currentIteration</code> and <code>target</code> parameters
            with the <a title="Animation interface">Animation</a> object that is
            being sampled.
        <li>Renamed <code>getCurrentPlayers</code> on the <code>Element</code>
            interface to <code>getAnimationPlayers</code>.
        <li>Removed the <code>PseudoElementReference</code> interface to use the
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/#the-pseudoelement-interface"><code>PseudoElement</code></a> interface from CSSOM instead.
      </ul>
