      This specification defines a model for synchronization and timing of
      changes to the presentation of a Web page.
      This specification also defines an application programming interface for
      interacting with this model and it is expected that further specifications
      will define declarative means for exposing these features.
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Web Animations defines a model for supporting animation and
        synchronization on the Web platform.
        It is intended that other specifications will build on this model and
        expose its features through declarative means.
        In addition, this specification also defines a programming interface to
        the model that may be implemented by user agents that provide support
        for scripting.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Use cases</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations model aims at two broad areas of application:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>User interface effects</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Animation can be used to give visual clues and feedback to make
              a user interface more readily comprehensible.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a user action results in a table row being
              removed to represent an item being removed from a shopping cart.
              In such a case, fading the row to transparent and then shifting
              the subsequent rows up to fill the space over a few hundred
              milliseconds provides the user with clear feedback as to the
              results of their action as opposed to instantly removing the row
              from the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              To support this scenario not only are the animated effects of
              fading and shifting required, but so is synchronization, both
              between the animations, and between animations and scripted
              actions (removing the table row from the DOM after the animations
              have completed).
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Storytelling and visualisation</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Another type of animation uses the animated effect to convey
              a story or represent some information.
              Unlike user interface effects which are largely a presentational
              adjunct to the content, these animations form an essential part of
              the content presented to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in an animated cartoon two cats fly through space
              to another planet leaving a rainbow trail behind them.
              After arriving at the planet a change of scene occurs and the user
              should decide whether or not the cats enter a magic mountain by
              selecting one of two preset destinations in the scene.
            </p>
            <p>
              This scenario requires the following features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>animated effects for moving characters along a path as well as
                  warping a path (the rainbow trail),
              <li>synchronization that allows some actions to happen
                  simultaneously (the two cats moving) and others in sequence
                  (the change of scene),
              <li>play control to allow rewinding the cartoon, or changing its
                  playback rate to accommodate particular learning or
                  accessibility needs,
              <li>the ability to trigger animations in response to user input
            </ul>
            <p>
              Similar use cases in this category include visualising physical
              phenomena such as spring motion for educational purposes,
              or visualising data such as the prevalence of a disease over
              a geographical space over a year whereby animation is used to
              present the time-based component of the data.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

      <section>
        <h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>
        <p>
          CSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]], CSS Animations 
          [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]], and SVG [[SVG11]] all provide mechanisms that
          generate animated content on a Web page.
          Although the three specifications provide many similar features,
          they are described in different terms.
          This specification proposes an abstract animation model that
          encompasses the common features of all three specifications.
          This model is backwards-compatible with the current behavior of these
          specifications such that they can be defined in terms of this model
          without any observable change.
        </p>
        <p>
          The animation features in SVG 1.1 are defined in terms of SMIL
          Animation [[SMIL-ANIMATION]].
          It is intended that by defining SVG's animation features in terms of
          the Web Animations model, the dependency between SVG and SMIL
          Animation can be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The programming interface component of this specification makes
          some additions to interfaces defined in HTML5 [[HTML5]].
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Overview of this specification</h3>
        <p>
          This specification begins by defining an abstract model for animation.
          This is followed by a programming interface defined in terms of the
          abstract model.
          The programming interface is defined in terms of the abstract model
          and is only relevant to user agents that provide scripting support.

      <h2>Web Animations model overview</h2>
      <p>
        At a glance, the Web Animations model consists of two largely
        independent pieces, a <em>timing model</em> and an <em>animation
        model</em>.  The role of these pieces is as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Timing model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes a moment in time and converts it to a proportional distance
          within a single iteration of an animation called the <em>time
          fraction</em>.
          An <em>iteration index</em> is also generated for animations
          that vary as they repeat.
        </dd>
        <dt>Animation model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes the <em>time fractions</em> and <em>iteration indices</em>
          produced by the timing model and converts them into a series of values
          to apply to the target properties and attributes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Graphically, this flow can be represented as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/timing-and-animation-models.svg" width="600"
            alt='Overview of the operation of the Web Animations model.'>
      </div>
      <p class="caption">
        Overview of the operation of the Web Animations model.<br>
        The current time is input to the timing model which produces a time
        fraction and an iteration index.<br>
        These parameters are used as input to the animation model which produces
        the values to apply.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider an animation that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>starts after 3 seconds,</li>
        <li>runs twice,</li>
        <li>takes 2 seconds every time, and</li>
        <li>changes the width of a rectangle from 50 pixels to 100
            pixels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first three points apply to the timing model.
        At a time of 6 seconds, it will calculate that the animation should be
        half-way through its second iteration and produces the result 0.5.
        The animation model then uses that information to calculate a width
        for the rectangle of 75.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification begins with the timing model and then proceeds to
        the animation model.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Timing model</h2>
      <p>
        This section describes and defines the behavior of the Web Animations
        timing model.
        <a>Timing events</a>, however, which are also a feature of the timing
        model, are described separately in <a href="#timing-events"
        class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>The timing model at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        Two features characterise the Web Animations timing model: it is
        <em>stateless</em> and it is <em>hierarchical</em>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Stateless</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Animations timing model operates by taking an input time and
          producing an output time fraction.
          Since the output is based solely on the input time and is independent
          of previous inputs, the model may be described as stateless.
          This gives the model the following properties:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Frame-rate independent</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the output is independent of previous inputs, the rate at
            which the model is sampled will not affect its progress.
            Provided the input times are proportional to the progress of
            real-world time, animations will progress at an identical rate
            regardless of the capabilities of the device running them.
          </dd>
          <dt>Direction-agnostic</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the sequence of inputs is insignificant, the model is
            directionless.
            This means that the model can be sampled in reverse or even in
            a backwards and forwards pattern without requiring any specialized
            handling.
          </dd>
          <dt>Constant-time seeking</dt>
          <dd>
            Since each input is independent of the previous input, the
            processing required to perform a seek operation, even far into the
            future, is at least potentially constant.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          There are a few apparent exceptions to the stateless behavior of the
          timing model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, <a>timing events</a> are fired when, for example, one sample
          falls on the opposite side of an animation's interval boundary to the
          previous sample.
          This is certainly stative behavior.
          However, events should be considered as a layer added on top of the
          core timing model.
          When no event listeners are registered, the model is stateless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other exception to this stateless behavior is that a number of
          methods defined in the <a href="#script-interface">programming
          interface</a> to the model provide play control such as pausing
          an item.
          These methods are defined in terms of the time at which they are
          called and are therefore stative.
          These methods are provided primarily for convenience and are not part
          of the core timing model but, like events, are layered on top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, each time the model is sampled, it can be considered to
          establish a temporary state.
          While this temporary state affects the values returned from the <a
          href="#script-interface">programming interface</a>, it has no
          influence on the subsequent samples and hence does not conflict with
          the stateless qualities described above.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Hierarchical</h3>
        <p>
          The other characteristic feature of the Web Animations timing model is
          that time is inherited.
          Time begins with a monotonically increasing time source and cascades
          down a number of steps to each animation.
          At each step, time may be shifted backwards and forwards, scaled,
          reversed, paused, and repeated.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/time-hierarchy.svg" width="600"
            alt="A hierarchy of timing nodes">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          A hierarchy of timing nodes.
          Each node in the tree derives its time from its parent node.
          At the root of the tree is the global clock.
        </p>
        <p>
          A consequence of this hierarchical arrangement is that complex
          animation arrangements can be reversed, scheduled, accelerated and so
          on as a whole unit since the manipulations applied to the parent
          cascade down to its <a>descendants</a>.
          Furthermore, since time has a common source, it is easy to synchronize
          animations.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Timing model concepts</h2>
      <p>
        In Web Animations timing is based on a hierarchy of time relationships
        between timing nodes.
        Parent nodes provide timing information to their child nodes in the form
        of <a>time values</a>.
        A <dfn>time value</dfn> is a real number which nominally represents
        a number of seconds from some moment.
        The connection between <a>time values</a> and wall-clock seconds may be
        obscured by any number of transformations applied to the value as it
        passes through the time hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p class="annotation">
        In the future we may have timelines that are based on UI gestures in
        which case the connection between time values and seconds will be
        weakened even further.
      </p>
      <p>
        Periodically, the user agent will trigger an update to the timing model
        in a process called <dfn>sampling</dfn>.
        On each <dfn>sample</dfn> the <a>time values</a> of each timing node are
        updated.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        A more precise definition of when the model is updated when scripting is
        involved is provided in <a
        href="#script-execution-and-live-updates-to-the-model"
        class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The global clock</h2>
      <p>
        At the root of the Web Animations timing hierarchy is the <a>global
        clock</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>global clock</dfn> is a source of monotonically increasing
        <a>time values</a> unaffected by adjustments to the system clock.
        The <a>time values</a> produced by the <a>global clock</a> represent
        wall-clock seconds from an unspecified historical moment.
        Because the zero time of the <a>global clock</a> is not specified,
        the absolute values of the <a>time values</a> produced by the <a>global
        clock</a> are not significant, only their rate of change.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note that the <a>global clock</a> is not exposed in the <a
        href="#script-interface">programming interface</a> and nor is it
        expected to be exposed by markup.
        As a result the moment from which <a>global clock</a> <a>time values</a>
        are measured, that is, the zero time of the clock, is allowed to be
        implementation-dependent.
        One user agent may measure the number of seconds since the the user
        agent was loaded whilst another may use the time when the device was
        started.
        Both approaches are acceptable and produce no observable difference
        in the output of the model.

      <h2>Timelines</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>timeline</dfn> provides a source of <a>time values</a> for the
        purpose of synchronization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, a <a>timeline</a> is tied to the <a>global clock</a> such
        that its absolute time is calculated as a fixed offset from the time of
        the <a>global clock</a>.
        This offset is established by designating some moment as the timeline's
        <dfn>zero time</dfn> and recording the <a>time value</a> of the
        <a>global clock</a> at that moment.
        At subsequent moments, the <a>time value</a> of the timeline is
        calculated as the difference between the current <a>time value</a> of
        the <a>global clock</a> and the value recorded at the <a>zero time</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="annotation">
        Note that we anticipate that other types of timelines may be introduced
        in the future that are not tied to the global clock.
        For example, a timeline whose time values correspond to UI gestures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since a <a>timeline</a> may be defined relative to a moment that has yet
        to occur, it may not always be able to return a meaningful <a>time
        value</a>.
        A <a>timeline</a> is considered to be <dfn>not started</dfn> when it is
        in such a state that it cannot produce a <a>time value</a>.
      </p>

        <h3>The document timeline</h3>
        <p>
          Each document has a <a>timeline</a> called the <dfn>document
          timeline</dfn> whose <a>time value</a> at a given moment is calculated
          as a fixed offset from the <a>global clock</a> such that its <a>zero
          time</a> corresponds to the moment immediately prior to dispatching
          the load event of the document.
          Prior to this moment, the <a>document timeline</a> is <a>not
          started</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For documents that support the concept of <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#current-document-readiness
          ">current document readiness</a>, this is the moment after the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/dom.html#current-document-readiness
          ">current document readiness</a> has changed to "complete" but
          before dispatching the load event.
          For user agents that support Navigation Timing [[NAVIGATION-TIMING]],
          this occurs between the <em>domComplete</em> and
          <em>loadEventStart</em> timings.
        </p>
        <div class="issue">
          This is not correct.
          We need a means to start animations prior to document load.
        </div>
        <p>
          Since the <a>document timeline</a> is tied to the <a>global clock</a>
          by a fixed offset, <a>time values</a> reported by the <a>document
          timeline</a> increase monotonically.
          Furthermore, since no scaling is applied, these <a>time values</a>
          are proportional to wall-clock seconds.

        <p>
          The children of a <a>timeline</a> are called <em>players</em>.
          A player takes a <a>timed item</a> which is a static description of
          some timed behavior and binds it to a <a>timeline</a> so that it runs.
          A player also allows run-time control of the connection between the
          <a>timed item</a> and its <a>timeline</a> by providing pausing,
          seeking, and speed control.
          The relationship between a player and a <a>timed item</a> is analogous
          to that of a DVD player and a DVD.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A <dfn>player</dfn> connects a single <a>timed item</a>, called its
        <dfn>source content</dfn>, to a <a>timeline</a> and provides playback
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>player</a> records the <a>time value</a> of its <a>timeline</a>
        at which its <a>source content</a> is scheduled to begin
        as the <dfn>player start time</dfn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a <a>player</a> is created, it is assigned a globally unique
        sequence number called the <dfn>player sequence number</dfn>.
        This number is used to resolve the sort order of players that have the
        same <a title="player start time">start time</a> for a variety of
        situations such as combining animations, queuing events, and returning
        the list of current players.
      </p>
      <p class="annotation">
        If we later allow restarting a <a>player</a> (e.g. by adding
        a <code>play()</code> method), we might update the sequence number at
        this point and rename it to something more appropriate.

        <h3>The current time of a player</h3>
        <p>
          <a>Players</a> provide a <a>time value</a> to their <a>source
          content</a> called the player's <dfn>current time</dfn>.
          The calculation of the <a>current time</a> is as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <code><a>current time</a> =
          (<var>timeline time</var> - <a>player start time</a>)
          * <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a>
          - <a>time lag</a></code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><var>timeline time</var> is the current <a>time value</a> of the
          <a>timeline</a> with which this <a>player</a> is associated.</li>
          <li><var>player start time</var> is the player's <a
          title="player start time">start time</a>.</li>
          <li><var>playback rate</var> is the player's <a
          title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> value described in <a
          href="#speed-control" class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
          <li><var>time lag</var> is the <a>time lag</a> value described in
          <a href="#seeking-and-pausing" class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the <a>timeline</a> with which the <a>player</a> is associated is
          <a>not started</a> then the <a>current time</a> is <code>null</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is often useful to treat the <a>current time</a> as zero when it
          would otherwise be <code>null</code>.
          We define the <dfn>effective current time</dfn> as being equal
          to <a>current time</a> unless the <a>current time</a> is
          <code>null</code>,
          in which case the <var>effective current time</var> is zero.</li>

        <h3>Seeking and pausing</h3>
        <p>
          Seeking and pausing a player are closely related and are described
          here together.
        </p>
        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Introduction to seeking</h4>
          <p>
            Changing the current playback position of a player can be used to
            rewind its <a>source content</a> to its start point, fast-forward
            to a point in the future, or to provide ad-hoc synchronization
            between timed items.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in Web Animations, the <a title="player start time">start
            time</a> of a <a>player</a> has special significance in determining
            the priority of animations (see <a href="#combining-animations"
            class="sectionRef"></a>) and so we cannot simply adjust the <a
            title="player start time">start time</a>.
            Instead, an additional offset is introduced called the <a>time
            lag</a> that further offsets a player's <a>current time</a> from
            its timeline.
            The effect of the <a>time lag</a> when seeking is illustrated
            below.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/seeking.svg" width="600"

          </div>
          <p class="caption">
            At time <var>t</var>, a seek is performed on the player changing its
            <a>current time</a> from 1.5s to 2s.<br>
            As a result, the <a>time lag</a> is set to -0.5s.<br>
            Note that the <a title="player start time">start time</a> indicated
            by a red star does not change.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible to seek a player even if its <a>timeline</a> is
            <a>not started</a>.
            Once the timeline begins, the player will begin playback from the
            seeked time.

          <h4>Introduction to pausing</h4>
          <p>
            Pausing can be used to temporarily suspend a <a>player</a>.
            Like seeking, pausing effectively causes the <a>current time</a> of
            a player to be offset from its <a>timeline</a> by means of
            setting the <a>time lag</a>.

            the duration of the interval during which the <a>player</a> was

          <h4>Seeking and pausing properties</h4>
          <p>
            <a>Players</a> track three properties related to seeking and
            pausing.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><dfn>time lag</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              The offset from a player's scheduled current time as defined by
              its <a title="player start time">start time</a>, and its actual
              current time after accounting for the effects of seeking and
              pausing.
              The <a>time lag</a> is initially zero and is updated as per the
              definition in <a href="#calculating-the-time-lag"
              class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn>paused state</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              A boolean value that is true if the player is currently paused.
              The <a>paused state</a> is initially false.

            <dd>
              The player's <a>effective current time</a> at the time when the

            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            A number of calculations for performing seeking and pausing are
            defined to operate even when the associated <a>timeline</a> is
            <a>not started</a>.
            For such situations we define the <dfn>effective timeline time</dfn>
            as the current <a>time value</a> of the <a>timeline</a> associated
            with a <a>player</a>;
            if the timeline is <a>not started</a>, then the <var>effective
            timeline time</var> is zero.

        <section>
          <h4>Calculating the time lag</h4>
          <p>
            The <a>time lag</a> value is both a stored and a calculated value.
            When a player is paused, the value is calculated from the <a>pause
            start time</a>.
            When a player is not paused, the stored value is used.
            The stored value is initially zero, and is updated when the player
            is unpaused or seeked.
          </p>
          <p>
            The value of <a>time lag</a> at a given moment is calculated as
            follows:
          </p>
          <dl class="switch">
            <dt>If the <a>paused state</a> is true,</dt>

            </dd>
            <dt>Otherwise,</dt>
            <dd>
              Return the stored value for this property.

        <section>
          <h4>Updating the <a>paused state</a></h4>
          <p>
            The procedure for updating the <a>paused state</a> is as
            follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Let <var>new value</var> be the new paused state to set.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <var>new value</var> equals the current <a>paused state</a>,
              return.
            </li>
            <li>
              The next step depends on the current <a>paused state</a> as
              follows,
              <dl class="switch">

            The rate of play of a player can be controlled by setting its

            Similarly, a playback rate of -1 will cause the player's <a>current

          rate">playback rate</dfn> that provides a scaling factor from the rate
          of change of the associated <a>timeline</a>'s <a>time values</a> to
          the player's <a>current time</a>.
          The <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> is initially 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting a player's <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a>
          to zero effectively pauses the player but without affecting the
          player's <a>paused state</a>.

        <section>
          <h4>Updating the playback rate</h4>
          <p>
            Changes to the <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a>
            also trigger a compensatory seek so that that the player's
            <a>current time</a> is unaffected by the change to the playback
            rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The procedure is as follows:

          <ol>
            <li>Let <var>previous time</var> be the value of the <a>effective

            <li>Update the <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> to

      <h2>Timed items</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>timed item</dfn> is an abstract term referring to a node in the
        timing hierarchy.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Relationship between timed items and players</h3>
        <p>
          The <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a>, if set, is a type of
          <a>timed item</a>.
          The <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a> is said to be <dfn
          title="directly associated with a player">directly associated</dfn>
          with that player.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>Timed items</a> can be combined together into a hierarchy using
          <a>timing groups</a> (see <a href="#grouping-and-synchronization"
          class="sectionRef"></a>).
          Only the <a>root</a> <a>timed item</a> of such a hierarchy can be
          <a>directly associated with a player</a>.
          If a <a>timed item</a> that has a <a>parent timing group</a> is
          designated as the <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a>, the
          <a>timed item</a> is removed from its <a>parent timing group</a>
          before being associated with the <a>player</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>timed item</a> is <dfn>associated with a player</dfn> if it is
          <a>directly associated with a player</a> or if it has an
          <a>ancestor</a> <a>timing group</a> that is
          <a>directly associated with a player</a>.
          At a given moment, a <a>timed item</a> can be <a
          title="associated with a player">associated</a> with at most one
          <a>player</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>timed item</a>, <var>item</var>, is <dfn>associated with
          a timeline</dfn>, <var>timeline</var>, if <var>item</var> is
          <a>associated with a player</a> which, in turn, is associated with
          <var>timeline</var>.

        <h3>Types of timed items</h3>
        <p>
          This specification defines two types of <a>timed item</a>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a>animations</a>, and</li>
          <li><a>timing groups</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All types of <a>timed item</a> define a number of common properties
          which are described in the following sections.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The active interval</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            The period that a <a>timed item</a> is scheduled to run is called
            its <a>active interval</a>.
            Each <a>timed item</a> has only one such interval.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> is determined by the
            <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> of the <a>timed
            item</a> but may be shifted by a <a>start delay</a> on the <a>timed
            item</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The upper bound of the interval is determined by the <a>active
            duration</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The relationship between the <a title="timed item start time">start
            time</a>, <a>start delay</a>, and <a>active duration</a> is
            illustrated below.

            title="timed item start time">start time</a> and beginning of the
            <a>active interval</a> are coincident.<br>
            (b) A timed item with a positive delay; the beginning of the
            <a>active interval</a> is deferred by the delay.<br>
            (c) A timed item with a negative delay; the beginning of the
            <a>active interval</a> is brought forward by the delay.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <a>Timed items</a> define an <dfn>active interval</dfn> which is the
          period of time during which the item is scheduled to produce its
          effect with the exception of <a>fill modes</a> which apply outside
          the <a>active interval</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> is defined by the
          combination of the timed item's <a title="timed item start time">start
          time</a> and <a>start delay</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>timed item</a>'s <dfn title="timed item start time">start
          time</dfn> is the moment at which the <a>parent timing group</a>, if
          any, has scheduled the <a>timed item</a> to begin.
          It is expressed in <a>inherited time</a>.
          In most cases, including the case when the <a>timed item</a> has no
          <a>parent timing group</a>, the <a title="timed item start time">start
          time</a> is zero.
          The singular exception is <a>sequence timing groups</a> which set the
          <a title="timed item start time">start times</a> of their children as
          described in <a
          href="#the-start-time-of-children-of-a-sequence-timing-group"
          class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a>,
          a <a>timed item</a> also has a <dfn>start delay</dfn> which is an
          offset from the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a>.
          Unlike the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> which is
          determined by the <a>parent timing group</a>, the <a>start delay</a>
          is a property of the <a>timed item</a> itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lower bound of the <a>active interval<a> of a <a>timed item</a>,
          expressed in <a title="inherited time">inherited time space</a>, is
          the sum of the <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> and the
          <a>start delay</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These definitions are incorporated in the calculation of the <a>local
          time</a> (see <a href="#local-time-and-inherited-time"
          class="sectionRef"></a>) and <a>active time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of the <a>active interval</a> is called the <dfn>active
          duration</dfn>, the calculation of which is defined in <a
          href="#calculating-the-active-duration" class="sectionRef"></a>.

        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            In Web Animations all times are relative to some point of reference.
            These different points of reference produce different <em>time
            spaces</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be compared to coordinate spaces as used in computer
            graphics.
            The zero time of a time space is analogous to the origin of
            a coordinate space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as with coordinate spaces, time spaces can also be nested.
            <a>Timing groups</a> typically perform some
            transformations on the <a>time values</a> they
            receive from their <a title="parent timing group">parent</a> or
            <a>player</a> before passing on the transformed <a>time values</a>
            to their children.
            Child <a>timed items</a> then operate <em>within</em> that
            transformed time space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children take the transformed time values from their
            parent&mdash;called the <a>inherited time</a>&mdash; and add their
            <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> to establish their
            own <a title="local time">local time space</a> as illustrated below.

              the <a>local time</a> is also 1.5

        <p>
          For a <a>timed item</a>, the <dfn>inherited time</dfn> at
          a given moment is based on the first matching condition from the
          following:
        </p>
        <dl class="switch">
          <dt>If the <a>timed item</a> has a <a>parent timing group</a>,</dt>

            the inherited time is the <a>parent timing group</a>'s current
            <a>transformed time</a>.

          <dt>If the <a>timed item</a> is directly associated with
              a <a>player</a>,</dt>

            the inherited time is the <a>current time</a> of the

        <p>
          The <dfn>local time</dfn> of a <a>timed item</a> is the <a>timed

        <h3>Timed item phases and states</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            At a given moment, a <a>timed item</a> may be in one of three
            possible <em>phases</em>.
            If a <a>timed item</a> has a <code>null</code> <a>local time</a> it
            will not be in any phase.
          </p>
          <p>
            The different phases are illustrated below.

          <div class="figure">

          <p class="caption">
            An example of the different phases and states used to describe
            a <a>timed item</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The phases are as follows:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><a>before phase</a></dt>
            <dd>
              The <a>timed item</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls before the item's
              <a>active interval</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt><a>active phase</a></dt>
            <dd>
              The <a>timed item</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls inside the item's
              <a>active interval</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt><a>after phase</a></dt>
            <dd>
              The <a>timed item</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls after the item's
              <a>active interval</a>.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            In addition to these phases, a <a>timed item</a> may also be
            described as being in one of several overlapping <em>states</em>.
            These states are only established for the duration of a single
            sample and are primarily a convenience for describing stative parts
            of the model such as event dispatch.
          </p>
          <p>
            These states and their useage within the model are summarised as
            follows:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><a>in play</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                Corresponds to a <a>timed item</a> whose <a>active time</a> is
                changing on each sample.
                This occurs when the <a>timed item</a> <em>and all its
                ancestors</em> are in the <a>active phase</a>.
                <a>Animations</a> only &ldquo;move&rdquo; when they are
                <a>in play</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is possible for a <a>timed item</a> to be in the <a>active
                phase</a> but not <a>in play</a>.
                For example, if a <a>timed item</a> has a <a>parent timing
                group</a> that causes the timed item's <a>active interval</a> to
                be clipped and both parent and child apply the same <a>fill
                mode</a>, the child <a>timed item</a> may be effectively be
                snapshotted within the <a>active phase</a> despite no longer
                being <a>in play</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Transitions to and from the <a>in play</a> state trigger
                timing events as defined in <a href="#timing-events"
                class="sectionRef"></a>.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><a>current</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                Corresponds to a <a>timed item</a> that is either <a>in play</a>
                or may become <a>in play</a> in the future.
                This will be the case if the <a>timed item</a> is <a>in play</a>
                or in its <a>before phase</a>, <em>or</em> it has an ancestor
                for which this is true thereby opening up the possibility that
                this <a>timed item</a> might play again (e.g. due to repeating).
              </p>
              <p>
                This state is used in the <a
                href="#script-interface">programming interface</a> to identify
                all <a>animations</a> and <a>players</a> that are likely to be
                of interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the <a>current</a> state provides an important
                definition for managing the amount of memory required by
                implementations.
                Assuming a monotonically increasing <a>timeline</a> an
                implementation can safely discard all <a>timed items</a> that
                are <em>not</em> <a>current</a> and not referenced elsewhere
                provided they take care to preserve any fill values.
                This is because such <a>timed items</a> will no longer have any
                dynamic effect.

      <section>
        <h3>Iteration intervals</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to specify that a timed item should repeat
          a fixed number of times or indefinitely.
          This repetition occurs <em>within</em> the <a>active interval</a>.
          The span of time during which a single repetition takes place is
          called an <dfn>iteration interval</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the <a>active interval</a>, a timed item can have multiple
          <a>iteration intervals</a> although typically only the interval
          corresponding to the <a>current iteration</a> is of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of a single iteration is called the <dfn>iteration
          duration</dfn>.
          The initial <a>iteration duration</a> of a timed item is simply its
          <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>intrinsic iteration duration</dfn> of a timed item is zero,
          however some specific types of timed item such as timing groups
          override this behavior and provide an alternative intrinsic duration
          (see <a
          href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-parallel-timing-group"
          class="sectionRef"></a> and <a
          href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-sequence-timing-group"
          class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>iteration duration</a> of a <a>timed item</a> may be set by the
          author to represent a value other than the <a>intrinsic iteration
          duration</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            Comparing the <a>iteration duration</a> and the <a>active

            <dt>Iteration duration</dt>
            <dd>
              The time taken for a single iteration of the timed item to
              complete.

            <dt>Active duration</dt>
            <dd>
              The time taken for the entire timed item to complete, including

        <h3>Controlling iteration</h3>
        <p>
          The number of times a <a>timed item</a> repeats is called its
          <dfn>iteration count</dfn>.
          The <a>iteration count</a> is a real number greater than or equal to
          zero.
          The <a>iteration count</a> may also be positive infinity to represent
          that the <a>timed item</a> repeats indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the <a>iteration count</a>, <a>timed items</a> also
          have an <dfn>iteration start</dfn> property which specifies an offset
          into the series of iterations at which the <a>timed item</a> should
          begin.
          The <a>iteration start</a> is a finite real number greater than or
          equal to zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behavior of these parameters is defined in the calculations in <a
          href="#core-timed-item-calculations" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            The effect of the <a>iteration count</a> and <a>iteration start</a>

            In the first case the <a>iteration count</a> is 2.5 resulting in the
            third iteration being cut-off half way through its <a>iteration
            interval</a>.<br>
            The second case is the same but with an <a>iteration start</a> of
            0.5.
            This causes the <a>timed item</a> to begin half way through the
            first iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the <a>iteration count</a> parameter, the <a>iteration

            Note that values of <a>iteration start</a> greater than or equal to

          We have already encountered different time spaces in describing
          <a>local time and inherited time</a> (see <a
          href="#local-time-and-inherited-time" class="sectionRef"></a>).
          Repetition introduces yet another time space: the iteration time
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Iteration time space</em> is a time space whose zero time is the
          beginning of a timed item's current iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the Web Animations model we also refer to <a>active
          time</a> which is a time relative to the beginning of the active
          interval.
          This time space, however, is internal to the model and not exposed in
          the script interface or in markup.
        </p>
        <p>
          These time spaces are illustrated below.

        <p class="note">
          Note that while the time spaces themselves are not bounded, Web

          diagram.
          For example, whilst a time of -1 second is a valid time in
          <em>active time space</em>, the procedure for calculating the
          <a>active time</a> defined in <a

          never return a negative value.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to these time spaces we can also refer to the
          <em>document time space</em> which is time space of the <a>time

        <h3>Interval timing</h3>
        <p>
          When a timed item repeats we must define the behavior at the iteration
          boundaries.
          For this and indeed for all interval-timing, Web Animations uses an
          endpoint-exclusive timing model.
          This means that whilst the begin time of an interval
          is included in the interval, the end time time is not.
          In interval notation this can written <code>[begin,end)</code>.
          This model provides sensible behavior when intervals are repeated and
          sequenced since there is no overlap between the intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the examples below, for the repeated item, at local time 1s,
          the iteration time is 0.
          For the sequenced items, at inherited time 1s, only item B will be
          <a>in play</a>; there is no overlap.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">

          sequenced timed items there is no overlap at the boundaries between

        </p>
        <p>
          An exception to this behavior is that when performing a <a
          href="#fill-behavior">fill</a>, if the fill begins at an
          interval endpoint, the endpoint is used.
          This behavior falls out of the algorithm given in <a
          href="#calculating-the-iteration-time"
          class="sectionRef"></a> and is illustrated below.

      <h2>Timed item speed control</h2>
      <p>
        Like <a>players</a>, <a>timed items</a> also have a <dfn
        title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</dfn> parameter.
        The <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> of a <a>timed
        item</a> is a finite real number that acts as a multiplier when
        calculating the <a>timed item</a>'s <a>transformed time</a> from its
        <a>local time</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effect of setting the <a title="timed item playback rate">playback
        rate</a> of a <a>timed item</a> differs from the setting the <a
        title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> on a player.
        Its behavior is defined in the timing calculations given in <a
        href="#core-timed-item-calculations" class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          In summary, the behavior of the <a title="timed item playback
          rate">playback rate</a> of a <a>timed item</a> is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> is applied
            only to the <a>active interval</a> of a <a>timed item</a> and not to
            the time while it is <a title="start delay">delayed</a> or <a
            title="fill mode">filling</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting a negative <a title="timed item playback rate">playback
            rate</a> on a <a>timed item</a> causes the <a>timed item</a> to
            begin at the end of its <a>active interval</a>.
            This differs from the <a title="player playback rate">playback
            rate</a> on a <a>player</a>.
            Setting a <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> on
            a <a>player</a> to a negative value at a moment before the
            <a>player</a>'s </a>source content</a> has begun, will result in the
            <a>source content</a> never playing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting the <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> of
            a <a>timed item</a> affects the calculated value of the <a>active
            duration</a> (see <a href="#calculating-the-active-duration"
            class="sectionRef"></a>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Changing the <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a>
              of a <a>timed item</a> whose <a>local time</a> is within its
              <a>active interval</a> will cause it to jump.
              This is because the <a>active duration</a> will be updated but the
              <a>local time</a> will not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, if other <a>timed items</a> depend on the <a>timed
              item</a>'s <a>active duration</a>, such as sibling <a>timed
              items</a> in a <a>sequence timing group</a>, they too may jump as
              a result of setting the <a>timed item</a>'s <a
              title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For runtime speed control the <a

      <h2>Core timed item calculations</h2>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          At the core of the Web Animations timing model is the process that
          takes an <a>inherited time</a> value and converts it to an
          <a>iteration time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this further transformations are applied before resulting at
          a final <a>transformed time</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step in this process is to calculate the bounds of the
          <a>active interval</a> which is determined by the <a>active
          duration</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process is illustrated below.

        <p class="caption">
          Calculation of the <a>active duration</a> is based on
          multiplying the <a>iteration duration</a> by the <a>iteration
          count</a> and then dividing by the <a

        <p>
          Having established the <a>active duration</a>, the process for

          (4) The <a>scaled active time</a> is then converted to an offset
          within a single iteration: the <a>iteration time</a>.<br>
          (5) The <a>iteration time</a> is converted into a <a>directed time</a>
          by incorporating the <a>playback direction</a>.<br>

            If the <a title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a> is

          <h4>Calculating the active time</h4>
          <p>
            The <dfn>active time</dfn> is based on the <a>local time</a>

            However, it is only defined when the <a>timed item</a> should
            produce an output and hence depends on its <a>fill mode</a> and
            phase as well as the phase of its <a>parent timing group</a>, if

        <p>
          It is often desirable to control the rate at which a <a>timed item</a>
          progresses.
          For example, easing the rate of animation can create a sense of
          momentum and produce a more natural effect.
          Conversely, in other situations such as when modelling a discrete
          change, a smooth transition is undesirable and instead it is necessary
          for the <a>timed item</a> to progress in a series of distinct steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For such situations Web Animations provides <a>timing functions</a>
          that scale the progress of a <a>timed item</a>.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Scaling using a cubic Bézier curve</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            A common method of producing easing effects is to use a cubic Bézier
            curve to scale the time.
            The endpoints of the curve are fixed at (0, 0) and (1, 1) while two
            control points <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> define the shape of
            the curve.
            Provided the <var>x</var> values of <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var>
            lie within the range [0, 1] such a curve produces a function that is
            used to map input times (the <var>x</var> values) onto output times
            (the <var>y</var> values).
            This arrangement is illustrated below.

        <h3>Relationship of group time to child time</h3>
        <p>
          The timing of the children of a <a>timing group</a> is based on the
          timing of the group.
          Specifically, times for the children are based on the parent's
          <a>transformed time</a>.
          With regards to repetition, this means the children operate
          <em>inside</em> an iteration of the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a <a>timing group</a> has an <a>iteration count</a> of
          2, then the children of of the group will all play twice since they
          effectively play <em>inside</em> the group's iterations.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <img src="img/grouping-repetition.svg" width="600"
                alt="The effect of multiple iterations on the children of a
                    group.">
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Since children of an <a>timing group</a> base their timing on the
          group's <a>transformed time</a>, when the group repeats, the
          children play again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that even in this case, the child <a>timed items</a> still have
          only <em>one</em> <a>active interval</a>.
          However, as a result of the parent's timing, the <a>active
          interval</a> is played twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an <a>iteration count</a> is specified for the children of a group
          as well as for the group itself, the effect is as if the <a>iteration
          count</a> of the group was multiplied with the <a>iteration count</a>
          of the children.
        </p>

        <p class="caption">
          Specifying an <a>iteration count</a> of 2 on an <a>timing group</a>
          and an <a>iteration count</a> of 3 on one of its children results in
          that child playing 6 times.
        </p>
        <p>
          A further result of the children of a <a>timing group</a> basing their
          timing on the group's <a>transformed time</a> is that they cannot
          animate outside of the group's <a>active interval</a>.
          This is because the <a>transformed time</a> of a group will not
          change outside its <a>active interval</a>.
          This allows groups to <em>clip</em> the playback of their children.

          <a>Timing groups</a> can be used to provide different kinds of
          synchronization behavior for their children.
          For example, one type of <a>timing group</a> runs its children in
          parallel, whilst another type runs the children in sequence.

          that schedules its <a>child timed items</a> such that they play in
          turn following their order in the group.
          This ordering is achieved by adjusting the <a

          Given a <a>time fraction</a>, a <a>current iteration</a>, and an

            The use of the term 'value' here is misleading, as the output of

            is composited with an underlying value. This takes place in the
            compositing stage, when the animation stack is resolved. It is
            therfore more accurate to describe the output of the effect stage
            as a set of values and corresponding composition operations, which
            are used to modify an underlying value. The same is true of the

          Since it is possible for multiple <a>in effect</a> <a

          This process is called <em>compositing</em> and is based on

        </p>
        <p>
          Each step in the process of evaluating an <a>animation stack</a> takes

          <a>intermediate animation value</a> from the <a>animation effect</a>
          is combined with the <a>underlying value</a> to produce a new value.
          This resulting value becomes the <a>underlying value</a> for combining

        that produces <a>intermediate animation values</a> for its <a>target
        properties</a> by interpolating between a series of property values
        positioned at fractional offsets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each set of property values indexed by a positional offset is called
        a <dfn>keyframe</dfn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>positional offset of a keyframe</dfn> is a value in the range
        [0, 1].
        The list of <a>keyframes</a> for a <a>keyframe animation effect</a> is
        sorted in ascending order by the <a
        title="positional offset of a keyframe">positional offset of each
        keyframe</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Unlike CSS syntax, <a>timing functions</a> are <em>not</em> directly
        associated with a <a>keyframe</a>.
        Rather, this is achieved by setting a chain of <a>timing functions</a>
        on the <a>timed item</a> (proposal for this is still in the works).
      </p>
      <p>
        If, due to a <a>timing function</a> specified on the <a>timed
        item</a> from which the <a>time fraction</a> is derived, the <a>time
        fraction</a> lies outside the range [0, 1], the specified
        <a>keyframe</a> property values are extrapolated to cover the extended
        range.

      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, each <a>keyframe</a> may also have an associated

            In the presence of certain timing functions, the input time
            fraction to an animation effect is not limited to the range [0, 1].
            Currently, however, keyframe offsets are limited to the range
            [0, 1] and property values are simply extrapolated for input time
            fractions outside this range. We are considering removing this
            restriction for the following reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are considering removing the restriction since cases exist where
            it is useful to be able to specify non-linear changes in property
            values at time fractions outside the range [0, 1].
          </p>
          <p>
            While this effect could be achieved by careful modification of the
            timing function, this approach is complex and breaks the model's
            separation of timing concerns from animation effects. An example is
            an animation which is subject to an 'overshoot' timing function and
            which has an effect that sweeps through a non-linear color space.

        <h3>Procedure for evenly distributing keyframes</h3>

          either a real number in the range [0, 1] or unspecified,
          we define such as list as <dfn>loosely sorted by offset</dfn> if, for
          each <a>keyframe</a> in the list that has a specified offset, the

          the angle of the tangent vector for the purpose of these calculations
          is defined to be an integer multiple of 2&pi; different from the value
          given by <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_angle">standard
          mathematical formulae for tangents to curves in 2
          dimensional space</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="todo">
          What does &ldquo;different from&rdquo; mean here?
        </p>
        <p>
          For moveto <a>path elements</a>, which are discontinuous,
          the angle of the tangent vector for the purpose of these calculations
          is always an integer multiple of 2&pi;.

        <p>
          At non-smooth junction points, the angle of the tangent vector for
          the purpose of these calculations is determined by the tangent to
          the curve after the junction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial value of the angle of the tangent vector is computed 
          using the first element of the curve, and is always in the range
          [0, 2&pi;).
        </p>
        <p>
          Single continuous path elements must never produce tangent
          vector angles that are discontinuous over their defined region. This
          implies that a single unique solution is available for all points on
          continuous path elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          When computing angles after discontinuous or non-smooth jumps,
          multiple possible solutions may be available.
          These solutions will differ by integer multiples of 2&pi;.
          In such cases the solution that lies closest to the previous tangent
          angle is used.

      <h2>Animatable properties</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>CSS Properties</h3>
        <p>
          Unless specified otherwise, all CSS properties are <a>animatable</a>.
          Examples of properties which are explicitly marked as not animatable
          are those defined in [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]] and [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]].
        </p>
        <div class='note'>
          <p>
            [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]] requires future CSS specifications to provide
            an &lsquo;Animatable:&rsquo; line for each newly defined property.
            This line defines how animation occurs.
            &lsquo;Animatable: none&rsquo; in this
            regard merely means that a property is not <em>continuously</em>
            animatable, that is, not <a>interpolable</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          This also applies to CSS properties defined in SVG [[SVG11]] which
          are likewise animatable except where explicitly noted otherwise.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>SVG Attributes</h3>
        <p>
          There are a number of SVG attributes which do not map to CSS
          properties but which are nevertheless animatable.
          The procedures for animating these attributes are defined in
          <span class="todo">a forthcoming SVG Animation specification</span>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>Animation of property types</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          The specific procedures for <a>interpolation</a> and <a>addition</a>
          of animation values for common CSS value types are defined below.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a given pair of animation values, the procedures depend on the
          types of the two values.
          If there is no set of procedures matching the particular types of the
          two values, the default procedures defined in <a
          href="#default-animation-procedures" class="sectionRef"></a> is used.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          In CSS transitions the interpolation procedure is determined by the
          property, not the specific values.
          Do we really want to define this in terms of the values in question?
          That seems to remove flexibility to make different properties with the
          same value types interpolate differently or turn off additive behavior
          on a per-property basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each set of procedures, a common notation is used. For
          <a>interpolation</a>,
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><var>V<sub>res</sub></var> is the result of the
              <a>interpolation</a> operation,
          <li><var>p</var> is the interpolation parameter, and
          <li><var>V<sub>start</sub></var> and <var>V<sub>end</var></var> are
              the animation values representing the start and end of the
              interpolation interval respectively.
        </ul>
        <p>For addition,</p>
        <ul>
          <li><var>V<sub>res</sub></var> is the result of the <a>addition</a>
              operation,
          <li><var>V<sub>a</sub></var> and <var>V<sub>b</var></var> are
              the two animation values to be added.
        </ul>
        <p>
          When an <a>addition</a> procedure is not commutative,
          <var>V<sub>a</sub></var> represents the first term of the operation
          and <var>V<sub>b</sub></var> represents the second.
        </p>
        <div class='informative'>
          <p>
            In some cases the mechanism by which <a>interpolation</a> and
            <a>addition</a> is achieved differs from that defined in
            [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]].
            However, the observable results of these operations should be
            identical.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, in [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]] length values are always
            converted to computed style pixel lengths and interpolated as
            numbers, whereas in this specification <a>interpolation</a> between
            different length units is defined using calc expressions.

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Animation of like types</h3>
        <p>
          When the types being interpolated or animated equal the following
          specific procedures are used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that in all cases, if the result of the addition is specified by
          a calc expression and the units of <var>V<sub>a</sub></var>  and
          <var>V<sub>b</sub></var> are related by a constant scalar multiple
          then the result of the calc expression is evaluated as defined in
          [[CSS3-VALUES]] before being returned.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          What does &ldquo;being returned&rdquo; mean here?
        </p>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            For example, the CSS &lsquo;px&rsquo; unit is related to the CSS
            &lsquo;in&rsquo; unit by a constant scalar multiple of 96 (i.e.
            96px = 1in).
            On the other hand, the CSS &lsquo;em&rsquo; unit is not related to
            the &lsquo;in&rsquo; unit by a constant scalar multiple.

        <h3>Animation of non-matching primitive types</h3>
        <p>
          In general, non-matching primitive types cannot be interpolated or
          added.
          Non-matching primitive types may only be interpolated or added
          if the property value they are defined on allows both those types,
          for example &lt;length&gt; and &lt;percent&gt;.
          In these cases, the CSS calc() function as defined in [[CSS3-VALUES]]
          is used.
        </p>
        <p>
          For interpolation:
          <blockquote>
            <var>V<sub>res</sub></var> =
              calc((1 - <i>p</i>) * <var>V<sub>start</sub></var> +
                   <i>p</i>  * <var>V<sub>end</sub></var>).
          </blockquote>  
        </p>
        <p>
          For addition:
          <blockquote>
            <var>V<sub>res</sub></var> =
              calc(<var>V<sub>a</sub></var> + <var>V<sub>b</sub></var>).

      <section>
        <h3>Animation of keywords and primitive types</h3>
        <p>
          If keyword value is be defined as equivalent to a primitive type,
          either directly, or via some intermediate calculation, the equivalent
          primitive type is be used, and
          interpolation and addition calculated are defined in <a
          href="#animation-of-like-types" class="sectionRef"></a> or <a
          href="#animation-of-non-matching-primitive-types"
          class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case that a keyword maps onto a finite ordered list of values
          with a determinable spacing between them, then a step-wise
          interpolation is used. For example, the font-weight property 
          accepts an ordered list of values from 100 to 900 in
          steps of 100. The interpolation in this case is defined as ((1 -
          <i>p</i>) * <var>V<sub>start</sub></var> + <i>p</i> *
          <var>V<sub>end</sub></var>), rounded to the nearest member of the
          list.
          Addition in this case is defined as (<var>V<sub>a</sub></var>
          + <var>V<sub>b</sub></var>), clamped to remain within the specifed
          list of values. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In all other cases, the keyword value is not interpolable. Result of
          add is the right hand side.

          used.

      <h3>Custom effects</h3>
      <div class="informative">
        <p>
          In some situations the <a>animation
          effects</a> provided by Web Animations may be insufficient.
          For example, the <a>animation effects</a>
          defined here are only able to target certain CSS properties.
          They are unable, therefore, to modify the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#__svg__SVGSVGElement__currentScale"><code>currentScale</code></a>
          property of an SVG element to smoothly zoom the viewport without
          affecting the document content.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such cases, where the provided <a>animation
          effects</a> do not provide needed functionality, an effect defined by
          script may be used.
          Such <a>custom effects</a> receive a <a>time
          fraction</a> and <a>current iteration</a> from the timing model and
          are responsible for producing an effect corresponding to the specified
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using an effect defined in script it is possible to animate not only
          otherwise un-animatable attributes and properties, but potentially
          anything that is accessible via script, including even producing audio
          or creating vibrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, using a <a>custom effect</a> that draws to a <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-canvas-element"><code>canvas</code></a>
          element, it is possible to produce a complex animated effect
          featuring patterns that may be difficult to create using CSS or
          SVG.
          Compared to using the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/">WindowAnimationTiming</a>
          interface, this approach ensures the animation is frame-rate
          independent and can be paused, reversed, eased with timing effects,
          accelerated, synchronized with other animations, and be controlled
          in the same manner as any other Web Animations animation without any
          additional programming.

        <h4>Execution order of custom effects</h4>
        <p>
          Since <a>custom effects</a>, unlike <a
          title="animation effect">animation effects</a>, are not limited to
          a single <a>target property</a>, the steps for assessing their
          order of execution differs from <a>animation effects</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>Custom effects</a> are executed after all
          <a>animation effects</a> have completed and
          applied their result to their targets (see <a
          href="#combining-with-other-styles--the-override-stylesheet"

        <p class="issue">
          Need to define this more precisely.
          Are styles flushed?
          Presumably they are.
          Can we suspend reflow for the duration of executing the script-based

        <p>

          this ordering through a <dfn
          title="custom effect priority">priority</dfn> property associated with
          the effect.
          This <a title="custom effect priority">priority</a> property, if
          defined, specifies the order in which the callbacks are executed
          such that the callback of the <a>custom effect</a> with the least

      <h2>Timing events</h2>
      <div class="issue">
        Possibly move this section into <a href="#timing-model"
        class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </div>
      <div class='issue'>
        <p>
          The current event model has two undesirable consequences:
          <ul>
            <li>
              There are two different modes in which events are dispatched:
              seeked mode and regular mode.
              Some applications will need to provide different handling based on
              the mode which complicates handling.
              Other applications will simply assume seeked mode behavior since
              the mode can change based on parameters outside the application's
              control (such as being switched to a background tab causing the
              refresh rate to drop and the maximum event threshold to be
              exceeded).
            </li>
            <li>
              Uneased timing can cause events to be reordered with respect
              to how they are visually percieved and can also cause events
              to be delivered with timestamps in the future.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          One alternative under consideration is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Primitive onstart / onend events that fire only when an 
            animation first starts playing and last stops playing.
          </li>
          <li>
            An onchange event that fires when the play state (e.g. current
            iteration, fill state, etc.) of an Animation changes, and provides
            a summary only of ther changes since the last sample.
            No more than one event is generated per animation per sample.
          </li>
          <li>
            The list of actual changes associated with a change event would be
            lazily generated since this could be costly to generate for large
            sample intervals.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          See <a

        </p>
        <p>
          Another possibility is that rather that switching to seeked event
          dispatch when there are many events to dispatch due to delays between
          samples, to instead ignore the delay (as is required for SVG).
          This would make seeked event dispatch predictable.
          This approach, however, does not address the issues regarding uneased
          timing.

        As <a>timed items</a> play they report changes to
        their status through <dfn title="timing event">timing events</dfn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>Timing events</a> are a property of the Web
        Animations timing model.
        As a result they are dispatched even for <a
        title="animation">animations</a> that do not have an associated
        <a>animation effect</a>, for <a>animations</a> whose
        <a>target element</a> is not rendered because it or a parent element has
        <span class="property">display</span> property of <span
        class="prop-value">none</span>, and for <a>timed
        items</a> that perform no animation such as <a>timing groups</a>.
      </p>
      <div class="annotation">
        <p><strong>Relationship to CSS and SVG events</strong></p>
        <p>
          CSS defines <code>AnimationEvent</code>s and
          <code>TransitionEvent</code>s and SVG defines <code>TimeEvent</code>s.
          The proposal here is to dispatch <a>TimingEvent</a>s in parallel to
          these events.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key difference is that the target of a <a>TimingEvent</a> is a
          <a>TimedItem</a> and not content.
          This model leaves firing of events at content up to the declarative
          mapping onto the model (e.g. CSS or SVG).
          This approach makes the Web Animations model more self-contained
          whilst permitting different mappings for different markup.
          For example, CSS fires events at the target element whilst SVG fires
          events at the element that generated the animation.

        <h3>Uneased timing</h3>
        <div class="informative">
          <p>
            <a>Timing events</a> in Web Animations rely on
            a mode of operating the timing model that does not apply <a
            title="timing function">timing functions</a> called <em>uneased
            timing</em>.
            There are two reasons for this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <a>Timing functions</a> are not always invertible.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to dispatch events in the correct order it is often
                necessary to convert from a <a>timed item</a>'s <a>local
                time</a> to a common time space for sorting and non-invertible
                <a>timing functions</a> make this
                impractical.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <a>Timing functions</a> on parent <a
                title="timing group">timing groups</a> can cause unnecessary
                events to be generated.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, consider a <a>timing group</a> that has a <a>timing
                function</a> that is not monotonically increasing such as
                a bounce effect.
                Within a single iteration of the <a>timing group</a> child <a
                title="timed item">timed items</a> may repeatedly exit and enter
                their <a>active interval</a>.
                Dispatching a <a>timing event</a> on each such moment is
                unlikely to be useful to most applications.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            An analogue is a graphics editing program where the user can apply
            a blur filter to a geometric shape.
            The graphics program may draw a selection box around the bounding
            box of the geometric shape ignoring the fact that the blur stretches
            (infinitely) beyond the selection box.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, since <a>fill modes</a> affect the
            calculation of times in ways that obscure the boundaries of the
            <a>active interval</a> they are also ignored when operating in
            <em>uneased time</em>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The <dfn>uneased timing</dfn> of a <a>timed item</a> refers to
          performing any of the calculations defined for the <a>timed item</a>
          with the following exceptions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a>Timing functions</a> on the <a>timed
              item</a> and all <a>ancestor</a> <a>timing groups</a> are
              ignored.</li>
          <li>The <a>fill modes</a> of the <a>timed item</a>
              and all <a>ancestor</a> <a>timing groups</a> are
              treated as <span class="prop-value">none</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the <em>uneased inherited time</em> of a <a>timed
          item</a> is calculated using the regular definition of <a>inherited
          time</a> after applying the two modifications to the timing of the
          item and its <a>ancestors</a> noted above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally the time value used as input to a child <a>timed item</a>
          of a <a>timing group</a> is the group's <a>transformed time</a>.
          However, since <a>uneased timing</a> does not apply <a
          title="timing function">timing functions</a>, we refer to <dfn>uneased
          child time</dfn> which is equivalent to both <em>uneased transformed
          time</em> and <em>uneased directed time</em>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Inverse timing calculations</h3>
        <p>
          For times calculated using <a>uneased timing</a> it is possible to
          perform the reverse operation to, for example, convert times from
          a <a>child timed item</a> to that of its its <a>parent timing
          group</a> or <a>timeline</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Calculating the <dfn><em>uneased local time</em> from <a>uneased child
          time</a></dfn> of a given <a>timed item</a> requires recording the
          iteration index that corresponds to the <a>uneased child time</a> and
          is calculated as follows.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Let <var>item</var> be the <a>timed item</a> for which the
              <em>uneased local time</em> is to be calculated.</li>

          The <dfn><em>uneased inherited time</em> from <em>uneased local

          If the <a title="player playback rate">player's playback rate</a> is

          The handling of an undefined value depends on the context in which it

          Typically, a current <a>time value</a> for the <a>timeline</a> is

        <h3>Event dispatch</h3>
        <p>
          <dfn>Events are queued</dfn> when either of the following occurs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a <a>timeline</a> is <a title="sampling">sampled</a>, or</li>
          <li>a <a>player</a> is <a title="seeking">seeked</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the former case&mdash;when a <a>timeline</a> is <a
          title="sampling">sampled</a>&mdash;since Web Animations put no
          requirements on the time between successive samples, it is often the
          case  that the moment when a change in state that should produce an
          event is scheduled to occur does not line up with a sample.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, except for the specific circumstances mentioned in following
          sections, the events that should be queued when <a>sampling</a>
          a <a>timeline</a> includes all events scheduled to occur in the
          interval since the previous sample time up to and including the
          current timeline time.

        <p class="note">
          Note that when a <a>player</a> is first <a

          href="#event-dispatch-and-time-adjustments" class="sectionRef"></a>
          after which point the previous sample time for that <a>player</a>
          will be resolved.
          As a result, there is never an occasion where the previous sample time
          is used and yet is undefined.

        <p>
          For the latter case&mdash;when a <a>player</a> is <a

          <h4>Seeked event dispatch</h4>
          <div class="informative">
            <p>
              Under some circumstances the usual behavior of dispatching all
              events scheduled between two times is not appropriate either
              because it would produce such a large number of events that
              performance may be adversely affected,
              or because it would produce counter-intuitive results in the
              circumstances.
              In such situations, an alternative form of event dispatch called
              <a>seeked event dispatch</a> is used.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            <dfn>Seeked event dispatch</dfn> is a mode of event dispatch that
            produces at most one <a>timing event</a> per <a>timed item</a> by
            comparing whether the <a>timed item</a> was <a>in play</a> or not at
            some <var>initial moment</var> and at some <var>final moment</var>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To facilitate this, each <a>timed item</a> has an associated
            <dfn>previous play state</dfn> property that initially has the
            value <em>not playing</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a given <a>timed item</a> the events queued as a result of
            performing <a>seeked event dispatch</a> at <em>uneased local
            time</em> <var>t</var> is as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>

                <a>timeline</a> with which the <a>timed item</a> is
                associated.
                The procedures for calculating the timeline time from a <a>timed
                item</a>'s <em>uneased local time</em> or the <a>current
                time</a> of a <a>player</a> are defined in <a

            <li>Let <var>timeline time</var> be the <a>time value</a> of the
                <a>timeline</a> with which the <a>timed item</a> is
                associated.
                The procedures for calculating the timeline time from a <a>timed

          <h4>Event dispatch and seeking a player</h4>
          <p>
            When a seek is performed on a <a>player</a> (see <a
            href="#performing-a-seek" class="sectionRef"></a>) <a>seeked event
            dispatch</a> is applied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to performing the seek, the <a>previous play state</a> of
            each <a>timed item</a> that is either the <a>source content</a> of
            the <a>player</a> or a descendent of the <a>source content</a> is
            updated to reflect whether the <a>timed item</a> is <a>in play</a>
            or not at the moment prior to performing the seek.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <a>time adjusted flag</a> of the <a>player</a> has been set,
            no update of the <a>previous play state</a> of the <a>source
            content</a> and its <a>descendants</a> is performed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <var>timeline time</var> used in the <a>seeked event
            dispatch</a> procedure is simply the <var>seek time</var>.
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing the seek, the previous sample time of the
            <a>player</a> is updated to reflect the <var>seek time</var> and the

          <p class="annotation">
            Suppressing events during seeking is necessary to provide performant
            seeking.
            It is also arguably the more intuitive behavior as, for example,
            when rewinding a cartoon one probably does not expect a bucketload
            of events to arrive as a result of traversing backwards over each
            <a>timed item</a>.

          <h4>Event dispatch and time adjustments</h4>
          <div class="informative">
            <p>
              Apart from seeking a <a>player</a>, making adjustments to the
              arrangement or timing of a player's <a>source content</a> can also
              cause the <a>timed items</a>' <a>local time</a> to jump.
              Like seeking, in such circumstances it is often not sensible to
              dispatch all the intermediate events but rather to employ
              <a>seeked event dispatch</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The range of circumstances where this behavior is necessary is
              quite broad when we consider the interdependencies in the timing
              of <a>timed items</a>.
              For example,
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a>Timing groups</a> calculate their <a>intrinsic iteration
              duration</a> based on the <a>active duration</a> of their
              <a title="child timed item">children</a>.</li>
              <li>Children of a <a>sequence timing group</a> base their
              <a title="timed item start time">start time</a> on the <a>active
              duration</a> of sibling <a>timed items</a> that appear earlier in
              the group.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              As such, even small changes to the timing of a <a>timed item</a>
              can have knock-on effects that affect all other <a>timed items</a>
              <a title="associated with a player">associated</a> with the same
              player possibly causing their <a>local time</a> to jump.
              As a result, <a>seeked event dispatch</a> is employed for the
              <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a> and <em>all</em> its
              descendents whenever <em>any</em> change is made to the timing or
              arrangement of any of those <a>timed items</a>.

          <p>
            The <a>time adjusted flag</a> is set to <code>true</code> whenever
            any of the following actions is performed on any of the <a>timed

          <div class="issue">
            <p>
              The <a>timingcancel</a> event may not be necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was introduced since in some situations it is useful to
              distinguish between an animation completing normally
              (<a>timingend</a>&mdash;in which case actions that are scheduled
              to occur at the end of the animation should be performed) and
              being prematurely terminated (<a>timingcancel</a>&mdash;in which
              case such actions will generally not be performed).
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently the only way to prematurely end a <a>timed item</a> is
              to manually disassociate it from any <a>player</a> which seems too
              rare to warrant a special event.
              If <a>players</a> could be cancelled or stopped in some way then
              this event may make more sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that the <em>touchcancel</em> event is conceptually similar
              and may be an argument in favor of keeping this event.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            A <a>timed item</a> that is not <a>associated with a player</a> is
            an <dfn>unattached timed item</dfn>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each time an operation is performed that causes a <a>timed item</a>
            that was <a>associated with a player</a> to become an <a>unattached
            timed item</a> it is appended to the end of a <dfn>queue of
            unattached timed items</dfn> associated with the <a>player</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should an <a>unattached timed item</a> later become <a>associated
            with a player</a> it is removed from any <a>queue of unattached
            timed items</a> it may be present in.
            As a result a <a>timed item</a> will only ever appear in at most one
            <a>queue of unattached times</a> and never twice in the same queue.

          <p>
            When <a>events are queued</a> as a result of <a>sampling</a>,
            the following steps are performed for all <a>timed items</a> in the
            <a>queue of unattached items</a> for each <a>player</a> that is <a

          <div class="informative">
            <p>
              In some circumstances, when <a>events are queued</a> during
              a <a>sample</a>, the number of events generated may be excessive.
              This can happen, for example, if the user agent dramatically
              reduces the sample rate for a background application to conserve
              battery, or if the device is activated after being in a sleep
              state for an extended period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In such situations, requiring the user agent to dispatch all
              <a>timing events</a> scheduled in the interim period would result
              in a significant drop in performance and in extreme circumstances
              may render the user agent temporarily unusable whilst it catches
              up on event processing.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to ensure a good user experience even in such
              circumstances a user agent may switch to <a>seeked event
              dispatch</a> to alleviate the burden of dispatching excessive
              events.

            If, whilst <a>sampling</a> a <a>timeline</a>, more than 30 <a>events

            A reverse method would be very useful here for effects like
            transitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The behavior would be:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>If <code>currentTime</code> is beyond the <a>end
                time</a> of the <a>source content</a> seek back to the end of
                the <a>active interval</a>.
            <li>Set <code>playbackRate</code> to
                <code>-playbackRate</code>.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This reflects how transitions work as well as common usage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some objections:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Calling <code>reverse</code> twice should be a noop.</li>
            <li><a>Players</a> should be independent of their
                <a>source content</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some suggestions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Call it <code>reverseSource</code> to make the link to the the
                <a>source content</a> obvious and remove any expectation that
                calling it twice is a noop.</li>
            <li>Make <a>players</a> actually stop when they reach
                the end of their <a>source content</a> much like a video/DVD/CD
                player.
                This would eliminate the need for the reverse seek and would
                make calling twice a noop.</li>

                Should we make this writeable? Then you could do:
              </p>
              <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
                animA.specified = animB.specified;

                Doing so would probably also involve defining
                <code>Timing.clone</code> and a constructor for <a>Timing</a>.

                Representing these parameters has been a particularly
                contentious topic.
              </p>
              <p>
                The current arrangement:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>requires defining both a <a>Timing</a> interface and
                    a <a>TimingInput</a> dictionary type which increases the API
                    surface area somewhat
                <li>means that setting the value occurs at a different place
                    (<code>anim.specified.duration</code>) to reading
                    the value (typically, <code>anim.duration</code>)
                <li>opens up questions about whether <a>Timing</a> objects
                    should be share-able or not
                <li>uses a union of a string and a double to represent
                    a duration which opens up questions about whether strings
                    such as <code>"3s"</code> should be allowed (and allowing
                    them makes walking the tree more complex).
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, it separates "specified" timing from "computed" timing
                which some consider advantageous.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only situation where calculated values and input values
                differ is for <code>duration</code> and
                <code>activeDuration</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                One alternative that has been proposed is to introduce
                a <code>Duration</code> interface as follows:
              </p>
              <pre class="example webidl">
interface TimedItem : EventTarget {
   // Timing
   attribute double   delay;
   attribute FillMode fill;
   attribute Duration duration;
   attribute Duration activeDuration;
   attribute double   playbackRate;
   // ...
   
   // Scheduled time
   readonly attribute double              startTime;
   readonly attribute unrestricted double endTime;
};

interface Duration {
  double    sec;
  DOMString string;
}
              </pre>
              <p>
                Usage is as follows:
              </p>
              <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
 var specifiedDur  = anim.duration.string; // "auto"
 var calculatedDur = anim.duration.sec; // 5
 
 // Update duration to 3s
 anim.duration.sec = 3;
 // anim.duration.string -&gt; "3s"
 
 // Update duration to 3s (alt.)
 anim.duration.string = "3s";
 // anim.duration.sec -&gt; 3
 
 // Reset to auto
 anim.duration.string = "auto";  
 // anim.duration.sec -&gt; 5
              </pre>

              The <a>start time</a> of this <a>timed item</a> in seconds.

            <p>
              The start of the <a>active interval</a> is based on the sum of

              Unlike the <code>duration</code> attribute of
              the <a>Timing</a> interface or <a>TimingInput</a> dictionary,
              this attribute returns the calculated value of the <a>iteration
              duration</a>.
              If <code>specified.duration</code> is the
              string <code>auto</code> or any unsupported value, this attribute
              will return the current calculated value of the <a>intrinsic
              iteration duration</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This value may be changed by setting the
              <code>duration</code> attribute of the

              As with <code>duration</code>, this attribute returns the

          <h4>Creating a new <code>Animation</code> object</h4>
          <p>
            The <a>Animation</a> constructor offers a number of approaches to
            creating a new <a>Animation</a> object.
            At its simplest, an <a>Animation</a> object that changes the
            &lsquo;left&rsquo; property of <var>elem</var> to 100 over three
            seconds can be achieved as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p>
            The second parameter, representing the <a>animation effect</a>, may
            specify multiple properties, an <a>AnimationEffect</a> object, or
            even a callback object.
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
// Specify multiple properties at once
var animA = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px', top: '300px' }, 3);

// Specify multiple frames
var animB = new Animation(elem, [ { left: '100px' }, { left: '300px' } ], 3);

// Share the animation effect of another animation
var animC = new Animation(elem, animB.effect, 3);

// Supply a specialized animation effect
var animD =
  new Animation(elem, new PathAnimationEffect("M100 250C100 50 400 50 400 250"), 3);

// Supply a custom script-based animation effect
var animE = new Animation(elem,
  { 
    sample: function(time) { 
      if (time !== null) {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0 + time * 2.0;
      } else {
        document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0;
      }
    }
  }, 3);
          </pre>
          <p>
            The third parameter representing the animation's timing, may
            simply be a number representing the <a>iteration duration</a> as
            above, or, to specify further timing properties such as the <a
            title="timed item playback rate">playback rate</a>,
            a <a>TimingInput</a> object can be used as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim =
  new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, { duration: 3, playbackRate: 2 });
          </pre>
          <p>
            It is also possible to omit the timing parameter altogether in which
            case default timing values will be used.
            Since the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> of an <a>animation</a>
            is zero, and the default <code>fill</code> when constructing an
            <a>Animation</a> is <span class="prop-value">forwards</span>, it is
            possible to create animations that simply set a property without
            any interpolation as follows,
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
new Animation(elem, { display: 'none' });
          </pre>
          <p>
            This is particularly useful in combination with other <a
            title="animation">animations</a> or <a>timed
            items</a>.
            For example, fading an element before switching
            &lsquo;display&rsquo; to &lsquo;none&rsquo; can be achieved as
            follows,
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
new SeqGroup(
  [
    new Animation(elem, { opacity: '0%' }, 1),
    new Animation(elem, { display: 'none' })
  ]
);
          </pre>
          <p>
            Having created an <a title="Animation interface">Animation</a>, it
            can be played using
            <code>document.timeline.play(<var>anim</var>)</code>.
            For simple effects, the <a
            href="#extensions-to-the-element-interface"><code>Element.animate</code></a>
            shortcut is more convenient since it performs this last step
            automatically. For example,
          </p>
          <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate({ left: '100px' }, 3);
          </pre>

                The primary use case for this method is an application that
                wants to increase the speed of all animations targetting
                a particular element by a factor of 2 (not sure why and never
                mind that this will affect all sorts of other elements too).
              </p>
              <p>
                With only <code>getCurrentAnimations</code> a naïve author might
                write:
              </p>
              <pre class="example sh_javascript">
                elem.getCurrentAnimations().forEach(
                  function(anim) {
                    anim.player.playbackRate *= 2;
                  }
                );
              </pre>
              <p>
                However, if <code>elem</code> is the <a>target element</a> for
                two animations that have the same player, then those animations
                will be sped up by a factor of 4.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead the author needs to generate a unique list of players
                first, hence this method.
              </p>
              <p>
                Is this kind of situation common enough to warrant this method?
                Or is it likely that when performing this kind of operation
                you're mostly working with single animations and not timing
                groups (as otherwise this operation could affect many other
                elements)?

        <h2>Script execution and live updates to the model</h2>
        <p>
          The interaction between script execution and the state of
          the model is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Changes made to the Web Animations model via the script interface
              are reflected immediately in the values returned by the interfaces
              defined in this specification.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, methods that operate on the current state of the model
              such as pausing or reversing are applied to a fully-updated timing
              model, that is, after all previous modifications have been
              incorporated.
            </p>
            <div class="informative">
              <p>
                For example, if the <a title="Player interface">Player</a>
                associated with an
                <a title="Animation interface">Animation</a>'s is <a
                title="seeking">seeked</a> via the API,
                the value returned when querying the
                animation's <code>startTime</code> will reflect updated state of
                the model immediately.
              </p>
              <pre class="example sh_javascript">
                // Initially anim's startTime is 3
                anim.player.currentTime += 2;
                alert(anim.startTime); // Displays '5'
              </pre>
              <p>
                The same concept applies to more complex modifications of the
                Web Animations model such as adding and removing children from
                a <a>TimingGroup</a>.

            <p>
              Changes to the model other than <a
              title="seeking">seek operations</a> do <em>not</em> cause
              <a href="#timing-events">timing events</a> to be queued
              immediately.
              Instead, such events are queued upon the next sample as defined
              in <a href="#event-dispatch" class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The behavior of events with relation to seek operations is defined

              class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Operations such as <a href="#updating-the-playback-rate">updating
              the playback rate of a player</a> that involve performing a <a

                For example, if a series of modifications to the timing model in

                time</a> to jump from being outside the <a>active interval</a>,
                to inside the interval, and then outside again, no events are

  anim.parent.playbackRate *= 2;
  // Adjust the start delay of anim such that it is no longer in its

  // Result: no alert is shown

          <li>
            <p>
              Modifications to the model using the script interface do not cause
              the properties of the target element to be updated and nor is any

              Gecko, for example, forces a synchronous sample when a seek is

      <h2>Integration with Media Fragments</h2>
      <p>
        The Media Fragments specification [[!MEDIA-FRAGMENTS]] defines a means
        for addressing a temporal range of a media resource.
        The application of media fragments depends on the MIME type of the
        resource on which they are specified.
        For resources with the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#MIMEType">SVG MIME type</a>
        [[!SVG11]], the application of temporal parameters is defined in the <a

        specification.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note that media fragments are defined to operate on resources based on
        their MIME type.

        <h3>Precision of time values</h3>
        <p>
          The internal representation of time values is implementation dependant
          however, it is RECOMMENDED that user agents be able to represent input
          time values with microsecond precision so that 0.000001 is
          distinguishable from 0.0.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Conformance criteria</h3>
        <p>
          This specification defines an abstract model for animation and, as
          such, for user agents that do not support scripting, there are no
          conformance criteria since there is no testable surface area.
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents that do not support scripting, however, may implement
          additional technologies defined in terms of this specification in
          which case the definitions provided in this specification will form
          part of the conformance criteria of the additional technology.

          A <dfn>conforming scripted Web Animations user agent</dfn> is a user

      <h2>Algorithms for event dispatch</h2>
      <p>
        The following algorithms demonstrate a possible approach to handling
        event queuing that incorporates the various requirements outlined in <a
        href="#timing-events" class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the features of the following approach are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sorts only once per timeline.
        <li>Handles cotemporal samples without dispatching duplicate events.
        <li>Handles zero-length intervals.
        <li>Stores sample state only at the <a>player</a> level.
            (The <a>previous play state</a> is still per-<a>timed item</a>
            however.)
            This makes it possible for an implementation to optimize
            the case when there are no registered event listeners on part of the
            timing hierarchy.
            In such a case the whole procedure for determining and dispatching
            events can be skipped for that part of the hierarchy.
            Should event listeners be attached at a later point, the
            state stored at the player can be used to ensure the previously
            ignored timed items begin providing events as if they had always had
            event listeners.
      </ul>
      <section>
        <h3>Interval boundaries and time marks</h3>
        <p>
          With regards to event dispatch, interval boundary conditions are
          particularly important.
          For example, if we were to conduct a <a>sample</a> at time 3s and then
          another sample at 5s, on that second sample we should dispatch all
          events between the two times.
          If a <a>timed item</a> were to start at time 5s, then we
          should dispatch the corresponding <a>timingstart</a> event since that
          time has arrived.
          However, since we will have already dispatched all events at time 3s
          during the previous sample, we should <em>not</em> dispatch any events
          coinciding with time 3s.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other situations, however, such as when getting the events
          scheduled by <a>child timed items</a> within a given iteration, we
          should include <a>timingstart</a> events that coincide with the start
          of the iteration but not <a>timingend</a> events since, under Web
          Animations endpoint-exclusive timing model, those <a>timingend</a>
          events happened fractionally before the iteration started.
          To accommodate these different endpoint behaviors we introduce the
          concept of <a>time marks</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>time mark</dfn> is a triple consisting of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a <span class="property">time value</span>,
          <li>a <span class="property">position</span>: <span
            class="position">minus</span>, <span class="position">zero</span>,
            or <span class="position">plus</span>, and
          <li>a Boolean flag indicating if the mark represents the endpoint of
              an interval or not (regardless of which &lsquo;end&rsquo; of the
              interval the mark represents)
        </ul>
        <p>
          We can use subscript notation to indicate these properties.
          For example, <var class="timeMark">t<sub>minus|end</sub></var>.
          If the time mark does not represent an interval endpoint, the
          &lsquo;|end&rsquo; part of the subscript text is dropped, as in
          <var class="timeMark">t<sub>minus</sub></var>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a given <a>time mark</a>, |<var class="timeMark">t</var>|
          indicates just the <span class="property">time value</span> ignoring
          the other properties, and <var class="timeMark">t<sub>pos</sub></var>
          indicates just the <span class="property">position</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <span class="position">minus</span> position represents a value
          an infinitely small amount less than the <span class="property">time
          value</span> whilst the <span class="position">plus</span> position
          represents a value infinitely small amount greater.
          <span class="position">zero</span> represents the moment at the time
          value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The meaning of these <span class="property">position</span> values is
          not affected by the direction in which playback proceeds.
          We can compare <span class="property">positions</span> and <span
          class="property">time values</span> as follows:
        </p>

      <h2>Changes since last publication</h2>
      <p>
        The following changes have been made since the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-web-animations-20130625/">25 June
          2013 Working Draft</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Renamed &lsquo;time drift&rsquo; to <a>time lag</a> and exposed the
            time lag in the <a title="Player interface">Player</a> interface of
            the <a href="#script-interface">programming interface</a>.
        <li>Changed the behavior of <a>fill modes</a> so that children
            that are clipped part-way through their <a>active interval</a> by
            a <a>parent timing group</a> only fill if they have the
            corresponding <a>fill mode</a> set.
        <li>Reworked the description of <a
            href="#timed-item-phases-and-states">timed item states</a> to
            include phases as well.
            Renamed the &lsquo;active&rsquo; state to the <a>in play</a> state.
        <li>Fixed a bug in the calculation of the time fraction for zero-length
            iteration durations (<a href="#calculating-the-time-fraction"
            class="sectionRef"></a>).
        <li>Renamed the following members of the <a>Timing</a> interface and
            <a>TimingInput</a> dictionary:
            <ul>
              <li><code>iterationDuration</code> &rarr; <code>duration</code>
              <li><code>startDelay</code> &rarr; <code>delay</code>
              <li><code>fillMode</code> &rarr; <code>fill</code>
              <li><code>iterationCount</code> &rarr; <code>iterations</code>
              <li><code>timingFunction</code> &rarr; <code>easing</code>
            </ul>
        <li>Introduced an <span class="prop-value">auto</span> value for
            <a>FillMode</a> and made it the default value for <code>fill</code>
            on <a>TimingInput</a>.
        <li>Added <a>timing function</a> syntax directly to this specification
            rather than referring to [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]].
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a
          href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/log/default/web-animations/index.html">changelog</a>
        provides a more detailed history.
