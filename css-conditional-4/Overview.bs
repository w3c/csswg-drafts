Abstract: This module contains the features of CSS
	for conditional processing of parts of style sheets,
	based on capabilities of the processor or the environment
	the style sheet is being applied in.
	It includes and extends the functionality of CSS Conditional 3 [[!css-conditional-3]],
	adding the ability to query support for particular selectors [[SELECTORS-4]]
	through the new ''selector()'' notation for [=supports queries=].
Default Highlight: css

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

	ISSUE: The features in level 3 are still defined in [[css-conditional-3]]
	and have not yet been copied here.

	This level adds extensions to the ''@supports'' rule
	to allow testing for supported selectors.

<h2 id="at-supports-ext">
Extensions to the ''@supports'' rule</h2>

	This level of the specification extends the <<supports-feature>> syntax as follows:

	<pre class="prod def" nohighlight>
		<dfn>&lt;supports-feature></dfn> = <<supports-selector-fn>> | <<supports-decl>>
		<dfn>&lt;supports-selector-fn></dfn> = selector( <<complex-selector>> )
	</pre>

	: <<supports-selector-fn>>
	::
		The result is true if the UA
		<a href="#dfn-support-selector">supports the selector</a>
		provided as an argument to the function.

<h3 id="support-definition-ext">
Extensions to the definition of support</h3>

	A CSS processor is considered to
	<dfn export for=CSS id="dfn-support-selector">support a CSS selector</dfn>
	if it accepts that selector
	(rather than discarding it as a parse error),
	and that selector doesn't contain
	<a>unknown -webkit- pseudo-elements</a>.

	<!-- COPY FROM L3 when importing the rest of the spec -->

	The ''selector()'' function may provide information about the user's software
	such as its version
	and whether it is running with non-default settings that enable or disable certain features.

	This information can also be determined through other APIs.
	However, the features in this specification are one of the ways this information
	is exposed on the Web.

	This information can also, in aggregate, be used to improve the accuracy of
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/unsanctioned-tracking/">fingerprinting</a> of the user.
