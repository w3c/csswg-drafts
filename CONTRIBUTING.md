in the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all 
contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the 
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.

# Tests

For normative changes for any specification in
[CR or later](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work) as well as the pre-CR specifications listed
below, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR must be
provided; for other specifications it is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at
the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the
corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate
[file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the
`type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.

The pre-CR specifications are currently:

* cssom
* cssom-view
