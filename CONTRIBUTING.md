# Web Platform Incubator Community Group

This repository is being used for work in the W3C Web Platform Incubator
Community Group, governed by the [W3C Community License Agreement
(CLA)](http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/). To make substantive
contributions, you must join the CG.

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please
identify all contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per
line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part
in designing the feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.
