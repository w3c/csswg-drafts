      <h1>Long description for example showing caption above a table</h1>

<P>This diagram shows the relationship between a table and a
caption above it and how they behave in the visual formatting
model.

<P>The diagram shows a table (drawn in blue) and a caption
(drawn in red) above it. 

<P>The table is a 5x3 grid of empty cells surrounded by a labeled
margin area. The caption contains a line of (insignificant) text and
is surrounded by a labeled margin area. The top margins of the table
and the caption collapse.
