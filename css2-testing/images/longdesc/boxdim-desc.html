      <h1>Long description of illustration of box areas</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates the four areas of the generic
CSS box: content, padding, border, and margin.

<P>There are four nested boxes: the content area
is the innermost, then padding, border,
and margin areas. Each area has a different border style to
distinguish its edge: the content edge is thin and solid; padding is
thin and dashed; border is thick and solid; margin is thick 
and dashed.

<P>Below the boxes, a legend lists the border styles used for
the four edges.
