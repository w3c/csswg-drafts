      <h1>Long description for kerning</h1>

<P>This image illustrates kerning.

<P>It shows the letters "AVfj" in a large, italic serif font. We see
that the bottom right part of the "A" crosses the vertical axis
separating it from the "V" to its right.  Similarly, the "f" and "j"
enter into each other's space.
