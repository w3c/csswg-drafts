      <h1>Long description of example illustrating precedence
in the collapsing borders model</h1>

<P>This diagram shows an example of which borders would be rendered
in the collapsing borders model where borders of different styles,
widths, or colors overlap.

<P>The diagram shows a three column, five row table of cells labeled
1 to 15.

<P>The table has a 5px solid yellow border. The first column
has a 3px solid black border, so the column's left border is
obscured by the table's left border. The fifth cell (row two,
column two) has a 5px dashed blue border that obscures the
segment of the black column border where they overlap. The
sixth cell (row two, column three) has a 5px solid green border that
obscures the fifth cell's right border where they overlap and
the table's right border where they overlap.
