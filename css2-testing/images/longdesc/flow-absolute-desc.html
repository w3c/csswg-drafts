      <h1>Long description for example illustrating absolute positioning</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates the effects of absolutely positioning a box.

<P>A document window is shown, with 8 lines (numbered 1 to 8), each
24px high. All text outside the "outer" box has been flowed
into lines 1 and 2. 

<P>The "outer" box is positioned absolutely so that it occupies
the lower right quadrant of the document window. All text in "outer"
and its descendants occupies the second half of lines 5 through 8.

<P>In the following PRE element, each 24 pixel line is simulated by
two lines, the second beginning with the appropriate number. 
The lines, as they appear in the image, contain:</p>


<PRE>

1 Beginning of body contents. End of 

2 body contents.

8                outer contents.
</PRE>
