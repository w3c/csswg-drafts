Abstract: <a>Media Queries</a> allow authors to test and query values or features of the user agent or display device, independent of the document being rendered.  They are used in the CSS @media rule to conditionally apply styles to a document, and in various other contexts and languages, such as HTML and JavaScript.

Introduction</h2>

Note: At the time of writing, [[MEDIAQUERIES-4]] is not completely finalized yet.
To avoid accidental divergences and maintenance overhead,
This specification is written as a delta specification over Media Queries Level 4.
Once the level 4 specification is final,
its content will be integrated into this specification,
which will then replace it.
Until then, Media Queries Level 5 only contains additions and extensions to level 4.


<h3 id='mq-features'>
Media Features</h3>

	Issue: Copy level 4 prose when final

<h4 id='mq-boolean-context'>
Evaluating Media Features in a Boolean Context</h4>

	Issue: Copy level 4 prose when final, except the following paragraph which is changed compared to level 4.

	When written like this, the <a>media feature</a> is evaluated in a <dfn export>boolean context</dfn>.
	If the feature would be true for any value
	<em>other than</em> the number ''0'',
	a <<dimension>> with the value ''0'',
	the keyword ''@media/update/none'',
	or a value explicitly defined by that media feature to evaluate as false in a boolean context,
	the <a>media feature</a> evaluates to true.
	Otherwise, it evaluates to false.

<h3 id="dynamic-range">
Dynamic Range: the 'dynamic-range' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: dynamic-range
	Value: standard | high
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>
</h3>

'@media/dynamic-range' represents the combination of max brightness,
color depth, and contrast ratio that are supported by the UA and output device.

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@media/dynamic-range">
	<dt><dfn>high</dfn>
	<dd>
		The combination of the User Agent and the output device
		fulfill all of the following criteria:
		* it has a [=high peak brightness=]
		* it has a [=high contrast ratio=]
		* its color depth is greater than 24 bit or 8 bit per color component of RGB
	<dt><dfn>standard</dfn>
	<dd>
		One or more of the criteria for a ''dynamic-range/high'' 'dynamic-range'
		is not fulfilled.
</dl>

<h3 id="contrast-brightness-of-display">
	Determining contrast and brightness of display</h3>

	<dfn export>Peak brightness</dfn> refers to how bright the brightest point
	a light-emitting device such as an LCD screen can produce,
	or in the case of a light reflective device such as paper or e-ink,
	the point at which it least absorbs light.

	Note: Some devices can only produce their [=peak brightness=]
	for brief periods of time or on a small portion of their surface at any given time.

	The <dfn export>contrast ratio</dfn> is the ratio of the luminance
	of the brightest color to that of the darkest color
	that the system is capable of producing.

	This specification does not define precise ways
	by which these qualities can be measured;
	it also lets the User Agent determine
	what counts as a <dfn for="contrast ratio" lt="high contrast ratio">high</dfn> [=contrast ratio=]
	and as a <dfn for="peak brightness" lt="high peak brightness">high</dfn> [=peak brightness=].
	User Agents must nonetheless attempt to conform to the following intent:
	a device capable of [=high peak brightness=]
	can display “brighter than white” highlights,
	and a simultaneous ability to do so
	while also presenting deep blacks
	(rather than an overall bright but washed out image)
	is indicative of a [=high contrast ratio=].

	Note: The determination for '@media/dynamic-range' and '@media/video-dynamic-range'
	will be vary depending on the User Agent,
	but is expected to have broadly dependable semantics.

<h2 id="video-prefixed-features">Video Prefixed Features</h2>

    Some user agents, including many TVs, render video and graphics in two
	separate "planes" (bi-plane) with distinct screen characteristics. A set of
	video-prefixed features is provided to describe the video plane.

	Any bi-plane implementation must return values based on the video plane
	for the following features: '@media/video-color-gamut'; '@media/video-width';
	'@media/video-height'; '@media/video-resolution'; '@media/video-dynamic-range'.
	All other features must return values based on the graphics plane.

    Non bi-plane implementations must return the same values for
	video-prefixed features and their non-prefixed counterparts.

<h3 id="video-color-gamut">
Video Color Display Quality: the 'video-color-gamut' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: video-color-gamut
	Value: srgb | p3 | rec2020
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>

The '@media/video-color-gamut' media feature describes the approximate range of colors
	that are supported by the UA and output device's video plane.
	That is, if the UA receives content with colors in the specified space
	it can cause the output device to render the appropriate color,
	or something appropriately close enough.

Value and color space definitions are the same as 'color-gamut'

<h3 id="video-dynamic-range">
Video Dynamic Range: the 'video-dynamic-range' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: video-dynamic-range
	Value: standard | high
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>

'@media/video-dynamic-range' represents the combination of max brightness,
color depth, and contrast ratio that are supported by the UA and output device's
video plane.

Supported values are the same as <a href="#dynamic-range">dynamic-range</a>.

<h3 id="video-width">
Video-Width: the '@media/video-width' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: video-width
	Value: <<length>>
	For: @media
	Type: range
	</pre>

	The '@media/video-width' media feature describes the width of the targeted display's video plane area
	of the output device. For continuous media, this is the width of the viewport
	(as described by CSS2, section 9.1.1 [[!CSS21]]) including the size of a rendered scroll bar (if any).
	For paged media, this is the width of the page box (as described by CSS2, section 13.2 [[!CSS21]]).

	<<length>>s are interpreted according to [[MEDIAQUERIES-4#units]].

	'@media/video-width' is <a spec=mediaqueries-4>false in the negative range</a>.

<h3 id="video-height">
Video-Height: the '@media/video-height' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: video-height
	Value: <<length>>
	For: @media
	Type: range
	</pre>

	The '@media/video-height' media feature describes the height of the targeted display's video plane area of the output device.
	For continuous media, this is the height of the viewport including the size of a rendered scroll bar (if any).
	For paged media, this is the height of the page box.

	<<length>>s are interpreted according to [[MEDIAQUERIES-4#units]].

	'@media/video-height' is <a spec=mediaqueries-4>false in the negative range</a>.

<h3 id="video-resolution">
Video Display Resolution: the 'video-resolution' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: video-resolution
	Value: <<resolution>> | infinite
	For: @media
	Type: range
	</pre>

	The '@media/video-resolution' media feature describes the resolution of the output
	device's video plane, i.e. the density of the pixels, taking into account the <a spec=cssom-view>page zoom</a>
	but assuming a <a spec=cssom-view>pinch zoom</a> of 1.0.

	The 'video-resolution' media feature is <a spec=mediaqueries-4>false in the negative range</a>

<h2 id='mf-environment'>
Environment Media Features</h2>

<h3 id="light-level">
Detecting the ambient light level: the 'light-level' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: light-level
	Value: dim | normal | washed
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>

	The 'light-level' media feature is used to query about the ambient light-level in which the device is used,
	to allow the author to adjust style of the document in response.
	The following values are valid:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@media/light-level">
		<dt><dfn>dim</dfn>
		<dd>
			The device is used in a dim environment,
			where excessive contrast and brightness would be distracting or uncomfortable to the reader.
			For example: night time, or a dimly illuminated indoor environment.

		<dt><dfn>normal</dfn>
		<dd>
			The device is used in a environment with a light level in the ideal range for the screen,
			and which does not necessitate any particular adjustment.

		<dt><dfn>washed</dfn>
		<dd>
			The device is used in an exceptionally bright environment,
			causing the screen to be washed out and difficult to read.
			For example: bright daylight.
	</dl>

	User agents should set the thresholds between the three levels
	in a way that takes into account the characteristics of the device.

	<div class="note">
		Even though it is expected that User Agents will adjust the value of this media feature
		based on ambient light sensors,
		this specification intentionally refrains from defining the three levels in terms of a measurement in lux,
		for several reasons:

		<ul>
			<li>
				Devices equipped with a light sensor usually adjust the brightness of the screen automatically.
				Depending on the level of adjustment,
				the thresholds for needing a low contrast or hight contrast content may vary.

			<li>
				Different screen technologies wash out at very different ambient light levels;
				e-ink displays remain readable in bright daylight,
				while liquid crystal displays do not.

			<li>
				Many embedded light sensors are inaccurately calibrated,
				making it difficult to establish useful thresholds valid across devices.
		</ul>
	</div>

	For accessibility purposes, user agents may offer manual controls
	allowing the user to switch between the three levels of independently of the ambient light level,
	as high contrast or low contrast styles may be more suitable for users with visual disabilities.

	<p class="issue">
		Using this media feature for accessibility purposes overlaps a lot with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465764.aspx">the high-contrast media feature proposed by Microsoft</a>.
		Can we adjust this so that it covers all use cases for both,
		or somehow modify them to work in an orthogonal, rather than overlapping, fashion?

	<div class="example">
		<pre>
		@media (light-level: normal) {
			p { background: url("texture.jpg"); color: #333 }
		}
		@media (light-level: dim) {
			p { background: #222; color: #ccc }
		}
		@media (light-level: washed) {
			p { background: white; color: black; font-size: 2em; }
		}
		</pre>
	</div>

<h3 id="environment-blending">
Detecting the display technology: the 'environment-blending' feature</h3>

    <pre class='descdef mq'>
    Name: environment-blending
    Value: opaque | additive | subtractive
    For: @media
    Type: discrete
    </pre>

    The 'environment-blending' media feature is used to query the characteristics of the user's display
    so the author can adjust the style of the document.
    An author might choose to adjust the visuals and/or layout of the page depending on the display
    technology to increase the appeal or improve legibility.

    The following values are valid:

    <dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@media/environment-blending">
        <dt><dfn>opaque</dfn>
        <dd>
            The document is rendered on an opaque medium, such as a traditional monitor or paper.
            Black is dark and white is 100% light.

        <dt><dfn>additive</dfn>
        <dd>
            The display blends the colors of the canvas with the real world using additive mixing.
            Black is fully transparent and white is 100% light.

            For example: a head-up display in a car.

        <dt><dfn>subtractive</dfn>
        <dd>
            The display blends the colors of the canvas with the real world using subtractive mixing.
            White is fully transparent and dark colors have the most contrast.

            For example: an LCD display embedded in a bathroom mirror.
    </dl>

    Issue: Is there a need for the ''subtractive'' value?

    <div class="example">
        <pre>
        body { background-color: white; }
        p { color: black; }

        @media(environment-blending: additive) {
            body { background-color: black; }
            p { color: white; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 1000; }
        }
        </pre>
    </div>

<h2 id='mf-scripting'>
Scripting Media Features</h2>

<h3 id="scripting">
Scripting Support: the 'scripting' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: scripting
	Value: none | initial-only | enabled
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>

	The 'scripting' media feature is used to query whether scripting languages,
	such as JavaScript,
	are supported on the current document.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@media/scripting">
		<dt><dfn>enabled</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that the user agent supports scripting of the page,
			and that scripting in the current document is enabled
			for the lifetime of the document.

		<dt><dfn>initial-only</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that the user agent supports scripting of the page,
			and that scripting in the current document is enabled during the initial page load,
			but is not supported afterwards.
			Examples are printed pages,
			or pre-rendering network proxies
			that render a page on a server
			and send a nearly-static version of the page to the user.

			Issue(503): Should there be an explicit minimum threshold to meet
			before a UA is allowed to claim ''initial-only''?
			Having one would mean authors would know
			what they can depend on,
			and could tailor their scripts accordingly.
			On the other hand, pinpointing that threshold is difficult:
			if it is set too low,
			the scripting facilities that authors can depend on
			may be to constrained to be practical,
			even though actual UAs may potentially
			all support significantly more.
			But trying to set it higher may cause us to exclude
			UAs that do support scripting at loading time,
			but restrict it in some cases based on complex heuristics.
			For instance, conservative definitions likely include at least
			running all inline scripts and firing the DOMContentLoaded event.
			But it does not seem useful for authors to constrain themselves to this
			if most (or maybe all) ''initial-only'' UAs
			also load external scripts (including ''async'' and ''defer'')
			and fire the load event.
			On the other hand,
			requiring external scripts to be loaded
			and the load event to be fired
			could exclude UAs like Opera mini,
			which typically do run them,
			but may decide not to based on timeouts and other heuristics.

		<dt><dfn>none</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that the user agent will not run scripts for this document;
			either it doesn't support a scripting language,
			or the support isn't active for the current document.
	</dl>

	Some user agents have the ability to turn off scripting support on a per script basis or per domain basis,
	allowing some, but not all, scripts to run in a particular document.
	The 'scripting' media feature does not allow fine grained detection of which script is allowed to run.
	In this scenario, the value of the 'scripting' media feature should be ''scripting/enabled'' or ''scripting/initial-only''
	if scripts originating on the same domain as the document are allowed to run,
	and ''scripting/none'' otherwise.

	Note: A future level of CSS may extend this media feature to allow fine-grained detection of which script is allowed to run.

<h2 id='custom-mq'>
Custom Media Queries</h2>

	When designing documents that use media queries,
	the same media query may be used in multiple places,
	such as to qualify multiple ''@import'' statements.
	Repeating the same media query multiple times is an editing hazard;
	an author making a change must edit every copy in the same way,
	or suffer from difficult-to-find bugs in their CSS.

	To help ameliorate this,
	this specification defines a method of defining <a>custom media queries</a>,
	which are simply-named aliases for longer and more complex media queries.
	In this way, a media query used in multiple places can instead be assigned to a <a>custom media query</a>,
	which can be used everywhere,
	and editing the media query requires touching only one line of code.

	A <dfn>custom media query</dfn> is defined with the ''@custom-media'' rule:

	<pre class='prod'>
		<dfn>@custom-media</dfn> = @custom-media <<extension-name>> [ <<media-query-list>> | true | false ] ;
	</pre>

	The <<extension-name>> can then be used in a <a>media feature</a>.
	It <strong>must</strong> be used in a <a>boolean context</a>;
	using them in a normal or <a>range context</a> is a syntax error.
	If a <<media-query-list>> is given,
	the <a>custom media query</a> evaluates to true
	if the <<media-query-list>> it represents evaluates to true,
	and false otherwise.
	If <dfn value for="@custom-media">true</dfn> or <dfn value for="@custom-media">false</dfn> is given,
	the <a>custom media query</a> evaluates to true or false, respectively.

	A ''@custom-media'' rule can refer to other <a>custom media queries</a>.
	However, loops are forbidden,
	and a <a>custom media query</a> must not be defined in terms of itself or
	of another <a>custom media query</a> that directly or indirectly refers to it.
	Any such attempt of defining a <a>custom media query</a> with a circular dependency
	must cause all the <a>custom media queries</a> in the loop to fail to be defined.

	If multiple ''@custom-media'' rules declare the same <<extension-name>>,
	the truth value is based on the last one alone,
	ignoring all previous declarations of the same <<extension-name>>.

	Note: For error handling purposes,
	an undefined <a>media feature</a> is different from
	a <a>media feature</a> that evaluates to false.
	See [[mediaqueries-4#error-handling]] for details.

	<div class='example'>
		For example, if a responsive site uses a particular breakpoint in several places,
		it can alias that with a reasonable name:

		<pre>
			@custom-media --narrow-window (max-width: 30em);

			@media (--narrow-window) {
				/* narrow window styles */
			}
			@media (--narrow-window) and (script) {
				/* special styles for when script is allowed */
			}
			/* etc */
		</pre>
	</div>

<h3 id='script-custom-mq'>
Script-based Custom Media Queries</h3>

	<div class='issue'>
		Define a map of names to values for JS.
		Values can be either a MediaQueryList object or a boolean,
		in which case it's treated identically to the above,
		or can be a number or a string,
		in which case it's treated like a normal MQ,
		and can use the normal or range context syntax.
		Like:

		<pre>
			&lt;script>
			CSS.customMedia.set('--foo', 5);
			&lt;/script>
			&lt;style>
			@media (_foo: 5) { ... }
			@media (_foo < 10) { ... }
			&lt;/style>

User Preference Media Features</h2>

<h3 id="inverted">
Detecting the desire for inverted colors on the display: the 'inverted-colors' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: inverted-colors
	Value: none | inverted
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>

	The 'inverted-colors' media feature indicates whether the content is displayed normally, or whether colors have been inverted.

	Note: This is an indication that the user agent or underlying
	operating system has forcibly inverted all colors, not a request to do so. This
	is sometimes provided as a simple accessibility feature, allowing users to
	switch between light-on-dark and dark-on-light text. However, this has
	unpleasant side effects, such as inverting pictures, or turning shadows into
	highlights, which reduce the readability of the content.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@media/inverted-colors">
		<dt><dfn>none</dfn>
		<dd>
			Colors are displayed normally.

		<dt><dfn>inverted</dfn>
		<dd>
			All pixels within the displayed area have been inverted.

			This value must not match
			if the User Agent has done some kind of content aware inversion
			such as one that preserves the images.

			Note: This is because the goal of this media feature
			is to enable authors to mitigate the undesirable effects of the non content aware approach
			that invert <em>all</em> the pixels.
			If the author were to take counter measures even in the content-aware cases,
			their counter measures and the UA's would be at risk of cancelling each other.

	</dl>

	<div class="example">
		For example, a user frequently using their operating system's ability to invert the screens color
		may want to add the following to their user style sheet,
		to limit the undesirable side effects of the inversion.

		<pre>
		@media (inverted-colors) {
			img { filter: invert(100%); }
			* { text-shadow: none !important; box-shadow: none !important; }
		}
		</pre>
	</div>

<h3 id="prefers-reduced-motion">
Detecting the desire for less motion on the page: the 'prefers-reduced-motion' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: prefers-reduced-motion
	Value: no-preference | reduce
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>

	The 'prefers-reduced-motion' media feature is used to detect if the user
	has requested the system minimize the amount of animation or motion it
	uses.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@media/prefers-reduced-motion">
		<dt><dfn>no-preference</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that the user has made no preference known
			to the system. This keyword value evaluates as false
			in the <a>boolean context</a>.

		<dt><dfn>reduce</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that user has notified the system that they
			prefer an interface that minimizes the amount of movement
			or animation, preferably to the point where all non-essential
			movement is removed.

	</dl>

<h3 id="prefers-reduced-transparency">
Detecting the desire for reduced transparency on the page: the 'prefers-reduced-transparency' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: prefers-reduced-transparency
	Value: no-preference | reduce
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>

	The 'prefers-reduced-transparency' media feature is used to detect if the user
	has requested the system minimize the amount of transparent or translucent
	layer effects it uses.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@media/prefers-reduced-transparency">
		<dt><dfn>no-preference</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that the user has made no preference known
			to the system. This keyword value evaluates as false
			in the <a>boolean context</a>.

		<dt><dfn>reduce</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that user has notified the system that they
			prefer an interface that minimizes the amount of
			transparent or translucent layer effects.
	</dl>

	ISSUE: How does this interact with preferences around e.g. pattern fills and backgrounds?
	They're not about transparency, but they also interfere with shape recognition.

<h3 id="prefers-contrast">
Detecting the desire for increased or decreased color contrast from elements on the page: the 'prefers-contrast' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: prefers-contrast
	Value: no-preference | high | low
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>

	The 'prefers-contrast' media feature is used to detect if the user
	has requested the system increase or decrease the amount of contrast
	between adjacent colors. For example, many users have difficulty
	reading text that has a small difference in contrast to the text
	background and would prefer a larger contrast.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@media/prefers-contrast">
		<dt><dfn>no-preference</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that the user has made no preference known
			to the system. This keyword value evaluates as false
			in the <a>boolean context</a>.

		<dt><dfn>high</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that user has notified the system that they
			prefer an interface that has a higher level of contrast.

		<dt><dfn>low</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that user has notified the system that they
			prefer an interface that has a lower level of contrast.

	</dl>

	ISSUE(2943): Split ''prefers-contrast/high'' into two levels,
	“extremely high” (as used in MSFT's black-on-white high conrast theme)
	and “increased (as implemented in Apple's Increased Contrast settings)?

<h3 id="prefers-color-scheme">
Detecting the desire for light or dark color schemes: the 'prefers-color-scheme' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: prefers-color-scheme
	Value: light | dark
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>

	The 'prefers-color-scheme' media feature reflects the user's
	desire that the page use a light or dark color theme.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@media/prefers-color-scheme">
		<dt><dfn>light</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that user has expressed the preference for
			a page that has a light theme (dark text on light background),
			or has not expressed an active preference
			(and thus should receive the "web default" of a light theme).

		<dt><dfn>dark</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that user has expressed the preference for
			a page that has a dark theme (light text on dark background).
	</dl>

	Note: The values for this feature might be expanded in the future
	(to express a more active preference for light color schemes,
	or preferences for other types of color schemes like "sepia").
	As such, the most future-friendly way to use this media feature
	is by negation such as ''(prefers-color-scheme: dark)'' and ''(not (prefers-color-scheme: dark))'',
	which ensures that new values fall into at least one of the styling blocks.

	The method by which the user expresses their preference can vary.
	It might be a system-wide setting exposed by the Operating System,
	or a setting controlled by the User Agent.

	Note: User preferences can also vary by medium.
	For example, a user may prefer dark themes on a glowing screen,
	but light themes when printing
	(to save ink
	and/or because inked text on blank paper prints better
	than blank letterforms knocked out of an inked background).
	UAs are expected to take such variances into consideration
	so that 'prefers-color-scheme' reflects preferences appropriate to the medium
	rather than preferences taken out of context.

	<div class=note>
		This feature, like the other 'prefers-*' features,
		previously had a <css>no-preference</css> value
		to indicate an author not expressing an active preference.
		However, user agents converged on expressing the "default" behavior
		as a ''light'' preference,
		and never matching <css>no-preference</css>.

		If a future user agent wishes to expose a difference
		between "no preference" and "really wants a light display",
		please contact the CSSWG to discuss this.
	</div>

<h3 id="forced-colors">
Detecting a forced color palette: the 'forced-colors' feature</h3>

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: forced-colors
	Value: none | active
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>

	The 'forced-colors' media feature is used to detect if
	the user agent has enabled a <a>forced colors mode</a>
	where it enforces a user-chosen limited color palette on the page.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@media/prefers-color-scheme">
		<dt><dfn>none</dfn>
		<dd>
			<a>Forced colors mode</a> is not active;
			the page's colors are not being forced into a limited palette.

		<dt><dfn>active</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that <a>forced colors mode</a> is active.
			The UA will provide the color palette to authors
			through the CSS system color keywords
			and, if appropriate, trigger the appropriate value of 'prefers-color-scheme'
			so that authors can adapt the page.
			See [[!css-color-adjust-1#forced]] for details.
	</dl>

<h3 id="prefers-reduced-data">
Detecting the desire for reduced data usage when loading a page: the 'prefers-reduced-data' feature</h3>

	Issue(4832): This feature may be an undesired source of fingerprinting,
	with a bias towards low income with limited data.
	A Privacy and Security section should be added to this spec,
	and it should address this concern.

	Issue(4833): It might be useful for this feature to be more than a binary switch,
	and instead express different degrees of preference for limited data.

	Issue(4834): This feature is an early draft,
	and the CSS-WG does not consider it ready for shipping in production.

	<pre class='descdef mq'>
	Name: prefers-reduced-data
	Value: no-preference | reduce
	For: @media
	Type: discrete
	</pre>

	The 'prefers-reduced-data' media feature is used to detect if the user
	has a preference for being served alternate content that uses less
	data for the page to be rendered.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@media/prefers-reduced-data">
		<dt><dfn>no-preference</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that the user has made no preference known
			to the system. This keyword value evaluates as false
			in the <a>boolean context</a>.

		<dt><dfn>reduce</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates that user has expressed the preference for
			lightweight alternate content.
	</dl>

	The method by which the user expresses their preference can vary.
	It might be a system-wide setting exposed by the Operating System,
	or a setting controlled by the User Agent.

	Note: User Agents may consider setting this based on the same user
	or system preference as they use to set the
	<a href="https://wicg.github.io/savedata/">Save-Data</a> HTTP request
	header.

	<div class="example">
		For example, a site could honour the preference of a user who
		has turned on data-saving mode by serving a smaller image.

		<pre>
		.image {
			background-image: url("images/heavy.jpg");
		}

		@media (prefers-reduced-data: reduce) {
			/* Save-Data: On */
			.image {
				background-image: url("images/light.jpg");
			}
		}
		</pre>
	</div>
