<BODY>
<H1 align="center">About the CSS2.1 Specification</H1>

<h2>Reading the specification</h2>

<P>This specification has been written with two types of readers in
mind: CSS authors and CSS implementors. We hope the specification will
provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient,
attractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to
CSS's implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all
they need to build <a href="conform.html#conformance">conforming user
agents</a>.

The specification begins with a general presentation of CSS and
becomes more and more technical and specific towards the end. For
quick access to information, a general table of contents,
specific tables of contents at the beginning of each section,
and an index provide easy navigation, in both the electronic
and printed versions.

<P>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation
in mind: electronic and printed. Although the two presentations will
no doubt be similar, readers will find some differences. For example,
links will not work in the printed version (obviously), and page
numbers will not appear in the electronic version. In case of a
discrepancy, the electronic version is considered the authoritative
version of the document.

<p>For brevity, this specification is sometimes called CSS2 instead of
CSS2.1. Unless explicitly stated, the name "CSS2" refers to this
version of the specification and not to the version published in
1998.</p>

<h2>How the specification is organized</h2>

<P>The specification is organized into the following sections:

<dl>

<dt><Strong>Section 2: An introduction to CSS2</strong>

<dd>The introduction includes a brief tutorial on CSS2 and
a discussion of design principles behind CSS2. 

<dt><strong>Sections 3 - 20: CSS2 reference manual.</strong>

<dd>The bulk of the reference manual consists of the CSS2 language
reference. This reference defines what may go into a CSS2 style sheet
(syntax, properties, property values) and how user agents must
interpret these style sheets in order to claim <a
href="conform.html#conformance">conformance</a>.


<dt><strong>Appendixes:</strong>

<dd>Appendixes contain information about <a href="sample.html">a
sample style sheet for HTML 4.0</a>, <a href="changes.html">changes
from CSS1 </a>, <a href="notes.html">implementation and
performance notes</a>, 
<a href="grammar.html">the grammar of CSS2</a>, 
a list of normative and informative <a href="refs.html">references</a>,
and three indexes: one for
<a href="propidx.html">properties</a>, one for
<a href="descidx.html">descriptors</a>, and one
<a href="indexlist.html">general index</a>.
</dl>

<H2>Conventions</H2>

<H3><a href="conform.html#doclanguage">Document language</a> elements
and attributes</H3>

<ul>
<li>CSS property, descriptor, and pseudo-class names are delimited
by single quotes.
<li>CSS values are delimited by single quotes.
<li>Document language element names are in uppercase letters.
<li>Document language attribute names are in lowercase letters 
and delimited by double quotes.
</ul>

<H3><a name="property-defs">CSS property definitions</a></H3>
<P>Each CSS property definition begins with a summary of key
information that resembles the following:</p>

<!-- #include src=properties/property-name.srb -->

<h4>Value</h4>

<P>This part specifies the set of valid values for the property. Value
types may be designated in several ways:

<ol>
<li> <a name="syndata.html#keywords">keyword</a> values (e.g., auto,
disc, etc.)

<li> basic data types, which appear between "&lt;" and "&gt;" (e.g.,
&lt;length&gt;, &lt;percentage&gt;, etc.). In the electronic version
of the document, each instance of a basic data type links to its
definition.

<li> types that have the same range of values as a property bearing
the same name (e.g., &lt;'border-width'&gt;
&lt;'background-attachment'&gt;, etc.).  In this case, the type name
is the property name (complete with quotes) between "&lt;" and "&gt;"
(e.g., &lt;'border-width'&gt;).  Such a type does <strong>not</strong>
include the value 'inherit'.  In the electronic version of the
document, each instance of this type of non-terminal links to the
corresponding property definition.


<li> non-terminals that do not share the same name as a property. In this
case, the non-terminal name appears between "&lt;" and "&gt;", as in
&lt;border-width&gt;.  Notice the distinction between
&lt;border-width&gt; and &lt;'border-width'&gt;; the latter is defined
in terms of the former. The definition of a non-terminal is located
near its first appearance in the specification.  In the electronic
version of the document, each instance of this type of value links to
the corresponding value definition.
</ol>

<P>Other words in these definitions are keywords that must appear
literally, without quotes (e.g., red). The slash (/) and the comma (,)
must also appear literally.

<P>Values may be arranged as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Several juxtaposed words mean that all of them must occur, in the
given order.
<li>A bar (|) separates two or more alternatives: 
exactly one of them must occur.
<li>A double bar (||) separates
two or more options: one or more of them must occur, in any order.
<li>Brackets ([&nbsp;]) are for grouping. 
</ul>

<P>Juxtaposition is stronger than the double bar, and the double bar
is stronger than the bar. Thus, the following lines are equivalent:
<PRE>
    a b   |   c || d e
  [ a b ] | [ c || [ d e ]]
</PRE>

<P> Every type, keyword, or bracketed group may be followed by one of
the following modifiers:</p>

  <UL>
    <LI>
      An asterisk (*) indicates that the preceding type, word, or group
      occurs zero or more times.

    <LI>
      A plus (+) indicates that the preceding type, word, or group 
      occurs one or more times.

    <LI>
      A question mark (?) indicates that the preceding type, word, or
      group is optional.

    <LI>
      A pair of numbers in curly braces ({A,B}) indicates that the
      preceding type, word, or group occurs at least A and at most
      B times.
  </UL>


<P>The following examples illustrate different value types:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <EM>Value:</EM> N | NW | NE<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> [ &lt;length&gt; | thick | thin ]{1,4}<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> [&lt;family-name&gt; , ]* &lt;family-name&gt;<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> &lt;uri&gt;? &lt;color&gt; [ / &lt;color&gt; ]?<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> &lt;uri&gt; || &lt;color&gt;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h4>Initial</h4>

<P>This part specifies the property's initial value. If the property
is inherited, this is the value that is given to the root element of
the <a href="conform.html#doctree">document tree</a>. Please consult
the section on <a href="cascade.html">the cascade</a> for information
about the interaction between style sheet-specified, inherited, and
initial values.


<h4>Applies to</h4>

<p>This part lists the elements to which the property applies. All
elements are considered to have all properties, but some properties
have no rendering effect on some types of elements. For example, <span
class="propinst-white-space">'white-space'</span> only affects
block-level elements.

<h4>Inherited</h4>

<p>This part indicates whether the value of the property is inherited
from an ancestor element. Please consult the section on <a
href="cascade.html">the cascade</a> for information about the
interaction between style sheet-specified, inherited, and initial
values.


<h4>Percentage values</h4>

<p>This part indicates how percentages should be interpreted, if they occur in
the value of the property. If "N/A" appears here, it means that the
property does not accept percentages as values.

<h4>Media groups</h4>

<p>This part indicates the <a href="media.html#media-groups">media
groups</a> to which the property applies. The <a
href="conform.html">conformance</a> conditions state that user agents
must support this property if they support rendering to the <a
href="media.html#media-types">media types</a> included in these <a
href="media.html#media-groups">media groups</a>.

<H3><a name="shorthand">Shorthand properties</a></H3>

<p>Some properties are <span class="index-def" title="shorthand
property"><dfn>shorthand properties</dfn></span>, meaning they allow
authors to specify the values of several properties with a single
property.

<P>For instance, the <span class="propinst-font">'font'</span> property
is a shorthand property for setting <span
class="propinst-font-style">'font-style'</span>, <span
class="propinst-font-variant">'font-variant'</span>, <span
class="propinst-font-weight">'font-weight'</span>, <span
class="propinst-font-size">'font-size'</span>, <span
class="propinst-line-height">'line-height'</span>, and <span
class="propinst-font-family">'font-family'</span> all at once.</p>

<P>When values are omitted from a shorthand form, each
"missing" property is assigned
its initial value (see the section on <a href="cascade.html">the
cascade</a>).

<div class="example"><p>
The multiple style rules of this example:</p>

<pre>
H1 { 
  font-weight: bold; 
  font-size: 12pt;
  line-height: 14pt; 
  font-family: Helvetica; 
  font-variant: normal;
  font-style: normal;
  font-stretch: normal;
  font-size-adjust: none
}
</pre>

<p>may be rewritten with a single shorthand property:</p>

<pre>
H1 { font: bold 12pt/14pt Helvetica }
</pre>

<p>In this example, <span
class="propinst-font-variant">'font-variant'</span>, <span
class="propinst-font-stretch">'font-stretch'</span>, <span
class="propinst-font-size-adjust">'font-size-adjust'</span>, and <span
class="propinst-font-style">'font-style'</span> 
take their initial values.</p>
</div>

<h3>Notes and examples</h3>

<P>All examples that illustrate illegal usage are clearly
marked as "ILLEGAL EXAMPLE".

<P>All HTML examples conform to the HTML 4.0 strict DTD (defined in
[[HTML40]]) unless otherwise indicated by a document type declaration.

<P>All notes are informative only.

<P>Examples and notes are marked within the source HTML for the
specification and CSS1 user agents will render them specially.

<h3>Images and long descriptions</h3>

<P>Most images in the electronic version of this specification are
accompanied by "long descriptions" of what they represent.  A link to
the long description is denoted by a "[D]" to the right of the image.

<P>Images and long descriptions are informative only.
