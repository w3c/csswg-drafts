<h2>Introduction to tables</h2>

<p>Tables represent relationships between data. Authors specify these
relationships in the <a href="conform.html#doclanguage">document
language</a> and specify their
<em>presentation</em> in CSS, in two ways: visually and aurally.

<P>Authors may specify the visual rendering of a table as a
rectangular grid of cells. Rows and columns of cells may be organized
into row groups and column groups. Rows, columns, row groups, row
columns, and cells may have borders drawn around them (there are two
border models in CSS2). Authors may align data vertically or
horizontally within a cell and align data in all cells of a row or
column.

<P>Authors may also specify the aural rendering of a table; how
headers and data will be spoken. In the document language, authors may
label cells and groups of cells so that when rendered aurally, cell
headers are spoken before cell data. In effect, this "serializes" the
table: users browsing the table aurally hear a sequence of headers
followed by data.

<div class="example"><P>
Here is a simple three-row, three-column 
table described in HTML 4.0:

<PRE class="html-example">
&lt;TABLE&gt;
&lt;CAPTION&gt;This is a simple 3x3 table&lt;/CAPTION&gt;
&lt;TR id="row1"&gt;
   &lt;TH&gt;Header 1      &lt;TH&gt;Header 2      &lt;TH&gt;Header 3
&lt;TR id="row2"&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;Cell 1        &lt;TD&gt;Cell 2        &lt;TD&gt;Cell 3
&lt;TR id="row3"&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;Cell 4        &lt;TD&gt;Cell 5        &lt;TD&gt;Cell 6
&lt;/TABLE&gt;
</PRE>

<P>This code creates one table (the TABLE element), three
rows (the TR elements), three header cells (the TH elements),
and six data cells (the TD elements). Note that the three columns
of this example are specified implicitly: there are as many
columns in the table as required by header and data cells.

<P>The following CSS rule centers the text horizontally
in the header cells and present the data with a bold font weight:</P>

<PRE>
   TH { text-align: center; font-weight: bold }
</PRE>

<P>The next rules align the text of the three header cells 
along a common baseline and centers the text in each data cell:</p>


<PRE>
   TH { vertical-align: baseline }
   TD { vertical-align: center }
</PRE>

<P>The next rules specify that the row of header cells will be surrounded
by a 3px solid blue border and each row of data cells will be surrounded
by a 1px solid black border:</P>

<PRE>
   TABLE { cell-spacing: none }
   TR#row1 { border-top: 3px solid blue }
   TR#row2 { border-top: 1px solid black }
   TR#row3 { border-top: 1px solid black }
</PRE>

<P>Note, however, that the borders around the rows overlap where the
rows meet. What color (black or blue) and thickness (1px or 3px) will
the border between row1 and row2 be? We discuss this in the section on
<a href="#border-conflict-resolution">border conflict resolution.</a>

<P>The following rule positions the table caption centered, above
the table:</P>

<PRE>
   CAPTION { caption-side: top }
</PRE>

<P>Finally, the following rule specifies that, when rendered
aurally, each column of data is to be spoken 
as a "Header, Data, Data":</P>

<PRE>
   TH { speak-header: once }
</PRE>

<P>For instance, the first column would be spoken "Header1 Cell1 Cell4".
The following rule:</p>

<PRE>
   TH { speak-header: always }
</PRE>

<P>would be spoken "Header1 Cell1 Header1 Cell4". 
</div>

<P>The preceding example shows how CSS works with HTML 4.0 elements;
in HTML 4.0, the semantics of the various table elements (TABLE,
CAPTION, THEAD, TBODY, TFOOT, COL, COLGROUP, TH, and TD) are
well-defined. In other document languages (such as XML), there may not
be pre-defined table elements. Therefore, CSS2 allows authors to "map"
document language elements to table elements via the <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> property. For example, the
following rule makes the FOO element act like an HTML TABLE element
and the BAR element act like a CAPTION element:</p>

<PRE class="example">
   FOO { display : table }
   BAR { display : table-caption }
</PRE>

<P>We discuss the various table elements in the following section. In
this specification, the term <span class="index-def" title="table
element"><dfn>table element</dfn></span> refers to any element
involved in the creation of a table. An "internal" table element is
one that produces a row, row group, column, column group, or cell.

<H2>The CSS table model</h2>

<P>The CSS table model is based on the HTML 4.0 table model, in which
the structure of a table closely parallels the visual layout of the
table. In this model, a table consists of an optional caption and any
number of rows of cells. The table model is said to be "row primary"
since authors specify rows, not columns, explicitly in the document
language. Columns are derived once all the rows have been specified --
the first cell of each row belongs to the first column, the second to
the second column, etc.). Rows and columns may be grouped structurally
and this grouping reflected in presentation (e.g., a border may
be drawn around a group of rows).

<P>Thus, the table model consists of tables, captions, 
rows, row groups, columns, column groups, and cells. 

<P>The CSS model does not require that the <a
href="conform.html#doclanguage">document language</a> include elements
that correspond to each of these components.  For document
languages (such as XML) that do not have pre-defined table elements,
authors must map document language elements to table elements; this is
done with the <span class="propinst-display">'display'</span>
property. The following <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> values assign table
semantics to an arbitrary element:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>table</strong> (In HTML: TABLE)
<dd>Specifies that an element defines a <a
href="visuren.html#block-level">block-level</a> table: it
is a rectangular block that participates
in a <a href="visuren.html#block-formatting">block formatting
context</a>.

<dt><strong>inline-table</strong> (In HTML: TABLE)
<dd>Specifies that an element defines an 
<a href="visuren.html#inline">inline-level</a> table: it
is a rectangular block that participates 
in an <a href="visuren.html#inline-formatting">inline formatting
context</a>).

<dt><strong>table-row</strong> (In HTML: TR)
<dd>Specifies that an element refers to a row of cells.
Note, however, that the calculation of <em>which</em> row of
cells depends on the document language.

<dt><strong>table-row-group</strong> (In HTML: TBODY)
<dd>Specifies that an element groups one or more rows.

<dt><strong>table-header-group</strong> (In HTML: THEAD)
<dd>Like 'table-row-group', but for visual rendering,
the row group is always displayed 
before all other rows and rowgroups and after any top
captions. 

<dt><strong>table-footer-group</strong> (In HTML: TFOOT)
<dd>Like 'table-row-group', but for visual rendering,
the row group is always displayed 
after all other rows and rowgroups and before any bottom
captions. 

<dt><strong>table-column</strong> (In HTML: COL)
<dd>Specifies that an element refers to a column
of cells. Note, however, that the calculation of <em>which</em> column 
of cells depends on the document language.

<dt><strong>table-column-group</strong> (In HTML: COLGROUP)
<dd>Specifies that an element groups one or more columns.

<dt><strong>table-cell</strong> (In HTML: TD, TH)
<dd>Specifies that an element contains table cell
data. 'Table-cell' elements may only be inside of 
'table-row' elements.

<dt><strong>table-caption</strong> (In HTML: CAPTION)
<dd>Specifies a caption for the table. Inherited
values of properties set for a caption element come
from the parent table element (e.g., percentage widths).
</dl>

<p>The <a href="sample.html">default style sheet for HTML 4.0</a>
in the appendix illustrates the use of these values for HTML 4.0:</p>

<pre class="example">
TABLE    { display: table }
TR       { display: table-row }
THEAD    { display: table-header-group }
TBODY    { display: table-footer-group }
TFOOT    { display: table-row-group }
COL      { display: table-column }
COLGROUP { display: table-column-group }
TD, TH   { display: table-cell }
CAPTION  { display: table-caption }
</pre>

<div class="note"><P> <em><strong>Note.</strong> User agents should <a
href="syndata.html#skip">skip</a> these <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> property values
for HTML documents, since authors should not alter an element's
expected behavior.</em>
</div>

<h3>Anonymous table elements</h3>

<P>For document languages other than HTML 4.0, authors may designate
elements to be some, but not all, of the table elements in the CSS2
table model. In such a case, the "missing" elements are inserted as <a
href="visuren.html#anonymous">anonymous elements</a> according
to the following rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Any table element will automatically generate a whole table tree
around itself, consisting of at least a 'table'/'inline-table', a
'table-row', and a 'table-cell'.
<li>If the parent a 'table-cell' is not a 'table-row',
an anonymous 'table-row' element will be assumed as its parent, and
this anonymous element will span all consecutive 'table-cell'
siblings. 
<li>If the parent of a 'table-row' is not a
'table'/'inline-table' nor a row group element, an anonymous 'table'
will be assumed as its parent, spanning all consecutive siblings that
also need an anonymous 'table' parent.
</ol>

<P>The same holds for row group elements.

<div class="example">
<p>In this XML example, an anonymous 'table' is inserted to
contain the HBOX element:</p>

<pre class="xml-example">
&lt;HBOX&gt;
  &lt;VBOX&gt;George&lt;/VBOX&gt;
  &lt;VBOX&gt;4287&lt;/VBOX&gt;
  &lt;VBOX&gt;1998&lt;/VBOX&gt;
&lt;/HBOX&gt;
</pre>

<p>The style sheet is:</p>

<pre class="example">
HBOX {display: table-row}
VBOX {display: table-cell}
</pre>
</div><!-- end of example -->

<p>Anonymous 'table-cell' elements are inserted as children of
'table-rows', to contain consecutive children that are not
'table-cell' elements.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>In this example, three anonymous 'table-cell' elements are inserted
to contain the text in the ROWs. Note that the text is further
encapsulated in anonymous inline boxes, as explained in <a
href="visuren.html#anonymous">visual rendering model</a>:</p>

<pre class="xml-example">
&lt;STACK&gt;
  &lt;ROW&gt;This is the &lt;D&gt;top&lt;/D&gt; row.&lt;/ROW&gt;
  &lt;ROW&gt;This is the &lt;D&gt;middle&lt;/D&gt; row.&lt;/ROW&gt;
  &lt;ROW&gt;This is the &lt;D&gt;bottom&lt;/D&gt; row.&lt;/ROW&gt;
&lt;/STACK&gt;
</pre>

<p>The style sheet is:</p>

<pre class="example">
STACK {display: inline-table}
ROW {display: table-row}
D {display: inline; font-weight: bolder}
</pre>

</div><!-- end of example -->

<p>Elements with <span class="propinst-display">'display'</span> set
to 'table-column' or 'table-column-group' are not rendered (exactly as
if they had 'display: none'), but they are useful, because they may
have attributes which induce a certain style for the columns they
represent.</p>

<h2>Table selectors</h2>

<p>Due to the uniqueness of the table structure, there are several
additional semantics and pseudo-classes for table elements.</p>

<div class="note"><p>
<em><strong>Note.</strong>
The implementation cost of these features may be high. They require two
passes over the style sheet: first to determine the <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span>, <span
class="propinst-float">'float'</span> and <span
class="propinst-position">'position'</span> properties using the
normal element hierarchy, than again searching for selectors that
match cell element inside column elements. In the second kind of
rules, <span class="propinst-display">'display'</span>, <span
class="propinst-position">'position'</span> and <span
class="propinst-float">'float'</span> may not appear.
</em>
</div>

<h3>Column and cell selectors</h3>

<p>Table cell selectors -- unlike other selectors in CSS -- may belong
to two contexts: rows and columns.  An author may write a CSS rule
that applies to either of the two contexts, but not to both (i.e.,
the contexts do not interact).

<P>Thus, to specify the color of all the cells in a particular
row, one would write:</P>

<pre class="example">
   TR.row1 TD { color: red }   /* HTML row and data cell */
</pre>

<P>To specify the color of all the cells in a particular
column, one would write:</P>

<pre class="example">
   COL.col3 TD { color: blue }   /* HTML column and data cell */
</pre>

<P>The following rule <em>does not</em> specify the color
of a single cell at the intersection of a particular row
and column:</p>

<pre class="example">
   TR.row1 COL.col3 TD { color: green }   /* This doesn't work!*/
</pre>

<P>Though syntactically correct, this rule neglects the fact
that row and column contexts do not mix. To specify properties
for a cell in a particular row and column authors may use
an "id" selector, as in:</p>

<pre class="example">
   TD.one-cell { color: green }   /* HTML row and data cell */
</pre>

<!-- I added row to this note. -IJ -->
<div class="note"><P>
<em><strong>Note.</strong>
If a cell spans more than one row or column, all
row or column parents apply in the selector.
</em>
</div>

<h3>Row pseudo-classes</h3>

<!-- Need intro -IJ -->

<p class="note">[The implementation cost of this feature is probably
even higher than the one in the previous section. Not only does it
require two passes, it also precludes the use of hash tables for quick
access to rules.]</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>:row[n], :row[%n], :row[%n+m]</strong>
<dd>This pseudo-class allows
the author to specify "the third row" (":row[3]"), "every third row"
(":row[%3]"), or "every third row, starting with the second row"
(":row[%3 + 1") (rows are zero-indexed).

<dt><strong>:row-even</strong>
<dd>This is a shortcut for a pseudo-class of
":row[%2]".

<dt><strong>:row-odd</strong>
<dd>This is a shortcut for a pseudo-class of
":row[%2+1.
</dl>

<!-- Need example  -IJ -->

<h3>Column pseudo-classes</h3>

<!-- Need intro -IJ -->

<dl>
<dt><strong>:column[n], :column[%n], :column[%n+m]</strong>
<dd>This pseudo-class
allows the author to specify (for example) "the third column"
(":column[3]"), "every third column" (":column[%3]"), or "every third
column, starting with the second column" (":column[%3 + 1") (columns
are zero-indexed).

<dt><strong>:column-even</strong>
<dd>This is a shortcut for a pseudo-class of
":column[%2]".

<dt><strong>:column-odd</strong>
<dd>This is a shortcut for a pseudo-class of
":column[%2+1]".
</dl>

<!-- Need example  -IJ -->

<h2>Tables in the visual rendering model</h2>

<P>In terms of the <a href="visuren.html">visual rendering model</a>,
a table may behave like a <a
href="visuren.html#block-level">block-level</a> or replaced <a
href="visuren.html#inline">inline</a> element.

<P>In both cases, the table element generates an <a
href="visuren.html#anonymous">anonymous box</a> that contains the
table box itself and the caption's box (if present). The table and
caption boxes retain their own content, padding, margin, and border
areas, and the dimensions of the rectangular anonymous box are the
smallest required to contain both.  Margins collapse where the table
box and caption box touch.

<h3>Caption position and alignment</h3>

<!-- #include src=properties/caption-side.srb -->

<P>This property specifies the position of the caption box with
respect to the table box. Values have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>top</strong>
<dd>Positions the caption box above the table box.
<dt><strong>bottom</strong>
<dd>Positions the caption box below the table box.
<dt><strong>left</strong>
<dd>Positions the caption box to the left of the
table box.
<dt><strong>right</strong>
<dd>Positions the caption box to the right of the
table box.
</dl>

<P>To align caption content horizontally
within the caption box, use the <span
class="propinst-text-align">'text-align'</span>
property. For vertical alignment, use the <span
class="propinst-vertical-align">'vertical-align'</span>
property.

<div class="example"><P>
<P>In this example, the <span
class="propinst-caption-side">'caption-side'</span>
property places captions below tables.
The caption will be as wide as the table,
and caption text will be left-justified horizontally
and centered vertically.

<PRE>
  CAPTION { caption-side: bottom; 
            width: auto;
            text-align: left;     
            vertical-align: middle;
          }
</PRE>
</div>

<h2>Visual layout of table contents</h2>

<P>Like other elements of the <a
href="conform.html#doclanguage">document language</a>, table elements
generate rectangular <a href="visuren.html#box-dimensions">boxes</a>
with content, padding, border, and margin areas.

<p>The visual layout of these boxes is governed by a rectangular grid
of rows and columns.  Each box occupies a whole number of grid cells,
determined according to the following rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each row box occupies one row of grid cells. Together, the row
boxes fill the table from top to bottom in the order they occur in the
source document (i.e., the table occupies exactly as
many grid rows as there are row elements).

<li>A row group occupies the same grid cells as the rows it contains.

<li>Columns are placed next to each other in the order they occur. Each
one occupies the number of grid columns given by its <span
class="propinst-column-span">'column-span'</span> property. A column
group occupies the same columns as the columns it contains. The
first column may be either on the left or on the right, depending on
the value of the <span class="propinst-direction">'direction'</span>
property of the table.

<li>Structurally speaking, each cell belongs to one row and column;
this row and column determine the coordinates of the cell.
Visually, each cell occupies a
rectangle of <span class="propinst-column-span">'column-span'</span>
grid cells wide and <span class="propinst-row-span">'row-span'</span>
grid cells high. The top row of this rectangle of grid cells must be
the row specified by the cell's parent. The rectangle must be as far
to the left as possible, but may not overlap with any other cell, and
must be to the right of all cells in the same row that are earlier in
the source document. (If the <span
class="propinst-direction">'direction'</span> of the table is
'right-to-left', interchange "left" and "right" in the previous
sentence.)

<li>Cells are <span class="propinst-row-span">'row-span'</span> high
only if there are enough rows: a cell cannot extend below the last row
box; it is made shorter until it fits.
</ol>

<p>Unlike other CSS boxes, however, margins of table boxes collapse
both vertically <em>and</em> horizontally. Thus, within a given row,
horizontal margins between adjacent cells will collapse. Similarly,
vertical margins between adjacent rows collapse, as to the margins
between a row and a row group boundary.  This collapsing uses the same
algorithm as <a href="visudet.html#collapsing-margins">vertical
collapsing</a> on regular <a
href="visuren.html#block-level">block-level</a> elements. This is
designed to allow easy duplication of the HTML "cell spacing" effect,
i.e., to easily design evenly spaced table cells in a table.</p>

<p><em>[Can this work? Maybe it is better to say that table elements
(other than 'table' and 'inline-table') have no margins at all, and
instead use a single 'cell-spacing' property for the whole table, or a
single horizontal and a single vertical spacing (see below)]</em></p>

<p>Only four properties apply to column and column group elements:
<span class="propinst-border">'border'</span>, <span
class="propinst-background">'background'</span>, <span
class="propinst-width">'width'</span>, and <span
class="propinst-column-span">'column-span'</span>. The first two are
actually shorthand properties, so all the border properties and all
the background properties apply.</p>

<p>Only <span class="propinst-border">'border'</span> and <span
class="propinst-background">'background'</span> apply to a row or row
group element. But note that authors may set inherited properties on
rows and row groups, and they will be inherited by the cells.</p>

<h3><a name="spanning-props">Row and column spans:</a> <span
class="propinst-column-span">'column-span'</span>, and 
<span class="propinst-row-span">'row-span'</span></h3>

<!-- #include src=properties/row-span.srb -->

<p>This property specifies the <span class="index-inst"
title="&lt;integer&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-integer">&lt;integer&gt;</span></span> number of
rows spanned by a cell.

<!-- #include src=properties/column-span.srb -->

<p>This property specifies the <span class="index-inst"
title="&lt;integer&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-integer">&lt;integer&gt;</span></span> number of grid
columns spanned by a cell, column, or column group.</p>

<!-- Need example/See previous example -IJ -->

<h3>Table layers and transparency</h3>

<p>The different table elements may be thought of as six superposed
layers for purposes of visual precedence. Except for transparent
parts, each layer hides lower layers from view, as shown in
Figure&nbsp;1.</p>

<!-- Are you sure you want to use OBJECT? -IJ -->
<object data="images/tbl-layers.gif">
<P>Figure 1. Schema of table layers.
<p><img src="images/tbl-layers.gif" alt="schema of table layers"></p>
</object>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The lowest layer is a single plane, representing the table box
itself. Like all boxes, it may be transparent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next layer contains the column groups. The columns groups are
as tall as the table, but they need not cover the whole table
horizontally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On top of the column groups are the areas representing the column
boxes. Like column groups, columns are as tall as the table, but need
not cover the whole table horizontally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next is the layer containing the row groups. Each row group is as
wide as the table. Together, the row groups completely cover the table
from top to bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last but one layer contains the rows. The rows also cover the
whole table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The topmost layer contains the cells themselves, and the borders in
between them. As the figure shows, although all rows contain
the same number of cells, not every cell may have specified content
These "empty" cells are transparent, letting lower layers shine through.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="html-example"><P>
In the following example, the rows contain four cells, but the first
cell of the second row has no content (it is "empty"), and thus
the table background shines through. The following HTML code
and style sheet rules:</p>

<PRE>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;STYLE type="text/css"&gt;
  TABLE {background: #ff0}
  TD {background: red; border: double black}
&lt;/STYLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;TABLE&gt;
  &lt;TR&gt;
    &lt;TD&gt; 1 
    &lt;TD rowspan="2"&gt; 2
    &lt;TD&gt; 3 
    &lt;TD&gt; 4 
  &lt;/TR&gt;
  &lt;TR&gt;
    &lt;TD&gt;
    &lt;TD colspan="2"&gt; 5
  &lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt; 
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Might be rendered as follows:</p>

<p><img src="images/tbl-empty.gif" alt="Table with an empty cell in lower left corner"></p>
</div>

<h3><a name="layout-algos">Table layout algorithms:</a>
the <span class="propinst-table-layout">'table-layout'</span>
property</h3>

<p>CSS does not define an "optimal" layout for tables since, in many
cases, what is optimal is a matter of taste. CSS does define
constraints that user agents must respect when laying out a
table. User agents may use any algorithm they wish to do so, and are
free to prefer rendering speed over precision.

<!-- Implementation notes? -->

<!-- #include src=properties/table-layout.srb -->

<p>The <span class="propinst-table-layout">'table-layout'</span>
property controls the algorithm used to lay out the table cells, rows,
and columns. Values have the following meaning:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>fixed</strong>
<dd>Use the fixed table layout algorithm
<dt><strong>auto</strong>
<dd>Use the automatic table layout algorithm
</dl>

<P>The two algorithms are described below.

<h4>Fixed table layout</h4>

<P>With this (fast) algorithm in which the
horizontal layout of the table does not depend on the
contents of every cell; it only depends on the table's width, the width
of the cells in the first row. 

<P>The table's width is determined by the <span
class="propinst-width">'width'</span> property.  If the value is
'auto', the table is as wide as the available horizontal space.

<P>Each first-row cell's width is determined as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A value other than 'auto' for the <span
class="propinst-width">'width'</span> property of the cell.
<li>Otherwise, a value other than 'auto' for the <span
class="propinst-width">'width'</span> property of the cell's column.
<li>Otherwise, all cells that
have a 'width' of 'auto' in the row are collected by the layout
engine, and when the end of the row is reached, all remaining
available space is evenly distributed among them.
</ol>

<p>In this manner, the user agent lays out the first row of the table
immediately upon receiving the content. All subsequent rows have the
same widths of columns of cells; nothing in subsequent rows can
affect the widths of the columns.  Any cell that has content that
overflows its dimensions uses the <span
class="propinst-overflow">'overflow'</span> property to determine how
to handle the overflow content. However, a value of 
'visible' will <em>not</em> increase the cell box dimensions; cell
content will flow into the adjacent cell. 

<P>With this algorithm, the height of a row of cells may either
be computed dynamically 
(the 'auto' value), or may be set explicitly, in which case overflow
is handled in the same manner as with the width dimension.

<h4><a name="auto-table-layout">Automatic table layout</a></h4>

<P>This is a multiple-pass algorithm in which a table width is given
by the width of its columns (and intervening <a
href="#borders">borders</a>). This algorithm reflects
the behavior of several popular HTML user agents at the writing of
this specification.

<P>In this algorithm, the width of each column is based on the largest
unbreakable element in a cell in that column.  This algorithm may be
inefficient since it may demand multiple passes and requires the user
agent to have access to all the content in the table before
determining the final layout.

<p>For this algorithm, a value of 'auto' for the <span
class="propinst-width">'width'</span> property for the table element
means that the final table width is computed dynamically: is the sum
of the column widths and the borders between them.

<p>Column widths are determined as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The width is given by the <span
class="propinst-width">'width'</span> property for the column
element.
<li>However, if there is no column element, or its <span
class="propinst-width">'width'</span> is 'auto', the
width is given by the width requirements of the cells in the
column.
<li>If the value of <span class="propinst-width">'width'</span> for the
first cell in the column is 'auto', the UA finds the "optimal" width
of the column, based on some heuristics.
</ol>

<p>The width computation is complicated by cells that span columns and
by widths that are specified as percentages. The problem of finding
the widths can be regarded as a constraint resolution system, that may
be over- or under-constrained. </p>

<p>A percentage is relative to the table width. If the table's width
is 'auto', a percentage represents a constraint on the column's width,
which a UA should try to satisfy. (Obviously, this is not always
possible: if the column's width is '110%', the constraint cannot be
satisfied inside a table whose <span
class="propinst-width">'width'</span> is 'auto'.)</p>

<p>A cell that spans columns provides a constraint on the sum of the
widths of the columns it spans.</p>

<p>If a cell's content doesn't "fit" the width of the column, the
<span class="propinst-overflow">'overflow'</span> property
determines what happens to it. Similarly, if the <span
class="propinst-width">'width'</span> of the table is not 'auto',
and the sum of the columns is not equal to the table's width, the
<span class="propinst-overflow">'overflow'</span> property of the
table determines what happens.</p>

<div class="note"><P>
<em><strong>Note.</strong>
During this algorithm, rows (and row
groups) and columns (and column groups) both constrain and are
constrained by the dimensions of the cells they contain. 
However, in the CSS table formatting model,
rows and columns do not interact with each other directly. While
column widths may change the width of a cell (due to word-breaking
occurring with different constraints), and this may affect the height
of the cell (and hence the row), the columns do not directly affect
the row height (or vice versa).

</div>

<h3><a name="alignment">Alignment of cell boxes</a></h3>

<P>Cells may be aligned vertically (within a row) and
horizontally (within a column).

<h4><a name="vertical-align">Vertical alignment in a row</a></h4>

<P>The height of a cell's box is constrained by the rows that contain
it.  A cell may be smaller than a row, in which case its vertical
alignment is governed by the <span
class="propinst-vertical-align">'vertical-align'</span> property (much
as an inline box is aligned within a <a
href="visuren.html#line-box">line box</a>).

<P>Each cell's content has a baseline, a top, a middle, and a bottom,
and so does the row itself. The value of the <span
class="propinst-vertical-align">'vertical-align'</span> property of
the cells determines on which of these lines they are aligned.  In the
context of tables, values have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>baseline</strong></dt>
<dd>The baseline of the cell is put at the same height as the baseline
of the row (see below for the definition of baselines of cells and
rows)
<dt><strong>top</strong></dt>
<dd>The top of the cell box is aligned with the top of the row
<dt><strong>bottom</strong></dt>
<dd>The bottom of the cell box is aligned with the bottom of the row
<dt><strong>middle</strong></dt>
<dd>The center of the cell is aligned with the center of the row
<dt><strong>sub, super, text-top, text-bottom</strong></dt>
<dd>These values do not apply to cells; the cell is aligned at the
baseline instead
</dl>

<p>The baseline of a cell is the baseline of the first line of text in
the cell. If there is no text, the baseline is the baseline of
whatever object is displayed in the cell, or, if it has none, the
bottom of the cell box. The maximum distance between the top of the
cell box and the baseline over all cells that have
'vertical-align:baseline' is used to set the baseline of the row. Here
is an example:</p>

<p><img src="images/cell-align.gif" alt="Example of vertically
aligning the cells"></p>

<p>Cell boxes 1 and 2 are aligned at their baselines. Cell box 2 has the
largest height above the baseline, so that determines the baseline of
the row.  Note that if there is no cell box aligned at its baseline, the
row will not have (i.e., need) a baseline.</p>

<p>To avoid ambiguous situations, the alignment of cells proceeds in a
certain order. First the cells that are aligned on their baseline are
positioned. This will establish the baseline of the row. Next the
cells with alignment 'top' are positioned.</p>

<p>The row now has a top, possibly a baseline, and a provisional
height, which is the distance from the top to the lowest bottom of the
cells positioned so far. (See conditions on the cell padding
below.)</p>

<p>If any of the remaining cells, those aligned at the bottom or the
middle, have a height that is larger than the current height of the
row, the height of the row will be increased to the maximum of those
cells, by lowering the bottom.</p>

<p>Finally the remaining cells are positioned.</p>

<p>The <a href="visuren.html#box-padding-area">padding area</a> at the top
and bottom of each cell box after positioning must be at least as
large as the <span class="propinst-padding">'padding'</span> property
specifies. The height of the row must be as small as possible without
violating this rule.</p>

<!-- Add example -IJ -->

<h4><a name="column-alignment">Horizontal alignment in a column</a></h4>

<p>The horizontal alignment of a cell's contents within a cell box is
specified with the <span
class="propinst-text-align">'text-align'</span> property.

<P>Cell boxes in the same column may also be aligned horizontally
along a common axis, specified by the <span
class="propinst-column-align">'column-align'</span> property.

<!-- #include src=properties/column-align.srb -->

<P>Specifies how cell boxes in the same column will align
horizontally. Values have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="index-inst" title="&lt;string&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-string"><strong>&lt;string&gt;</strong></span></span>

<dd>Align cell content along the beginning of the specified string
(the beginning depends on the <span
class="propinst-direction">'direction'</span> property). 
If the string occurs more than once in the cell's content, the
cell is aligned on the first occurrence.
If the string doesn't occur, the cell is aligned at the end of the
content.

<p>Aligning text in this way is only useful if the text only spans one
line. The result is undefined if the text spans more than one line.
</dd>

<dt><strong>none</strong>
<dd>No column alignment.
</dl>

<!-- Add example -IJ -->

<h3><a name="dynamic-effects">Dynamic row and column effects</a></h3>

<p>The <span class="propinst-visibility">'visibility'</span> property
takes the value 'collapse' for row, row group, column, and column
group elements. This value causes the entire row or column to be
removed from the display, and the space normally taken up by the row
or column to be made available for other content. The suppression of
the row or column, however, does not otherwise affect the layout of
the table. This allows dynamic effects to remove table rows or columns
without forcing a re-layout of the table in order to account for the
potential change in column constraints.

<!-- Example? -IJ -->

<h2><a name="borders">Borders</a></h2>

<p>There are two distinct models for setting borders on table cells in
CSS. One is most suitable for so-called <span class="index-inst"
title="2½D borders">"2½D" borders</span> around individual cells, the
other is suitable for borders that are continuous from one end of the
table to the other. Many border styles can be achieved with either
model, so it is often a matter of taste which model is used.

<!-- #include src=properties/cell-spacing.srb -->
<!-- maybe-include src=properties/border-collapse.srb -->

<P>This property <span
class="propinst-cell-spacing">'cell-spacing'</span> selects a table's
border model. Values have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>none</strong>
<dd>Use the 2½D border model.
<dt><span class="index-inst" title="&lt;length&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-length"><strong>&lt;length&gt;</strong></span></span>
<span class="index-inst" title="&lt;length&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-length"><strong>&lt;length&gt;?</strong></span></span>
<dd>Use the collapsing border model. In this case, the
lengths specify the distance that separate adjacent cell borders.
If one length is specified, gives both the horizontal and vertical
spacing. If two are specified, the first gives the horizontal
spacing and the second the vertical spacing. Lengths may
not be negative.
</dl>

<P>The models are described below.

<h3><a name="2D">The 2½D border model</a></h3>

<p>In this model, each cell has a single rectangular border.  The
<span class="propinst-cell-spacing">'cell-spacing'</span> property
specifies the distance between the borders of adjacent cells.  This
space is filled with the background of the table element.  Rows,
columns, row groups, and column groups cannot have borders (i.e., user
agents must <span class="index-inst" title="skip"><a
href="syndata.html#skip">skip</a></span> the border properties for
those elements.

<div class="example">
<p>The table in Figure 3 could be the result of a style sheet like
this:

<pre>
TABLE      {border: outset 10pt; cell-spacing: 15pt}
TD         {border: inset 5pt}
TD.special {border: inset 10pt}  /* The top-left cell */
</pre>

<div class=figure>
<p><img src="images/tbl-spacing.gif" alt="A table with cell-spacing"></p>
<p class=caption>Figure 3. A table with <span
class="propinst-cell-spacing">'cell-spacing'</span> set to a length
value. Note that each cell has its own border, and the table has a
separate border as well.
</div>
</div>

<P>When this border model is used, the overall width of the table is
the sum of the cells plus the cell-spacing between all borders. See
the section on <a href="#auto-table-layout">automatic table layout</a>
for more information about table dimension calculations.

<h3><a name="collapsing-borders">The collapsing border model</a></h3>

<p>In the (more complex) collapsing border model, it is possible to
specify borders that surround all or part of a cell, row, row group,
column, and column group. Authors may specify internal rules with
this model.

<p>Borders are centered on the grid lines between the cells. User
agents must find a consistent rule for rounding off in the case of an
odd number of discrete units (screen pixels, printer dots).</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how the width of the table, the widths of
the borders, the padding, and the cell width interact. Their relation
is given by the following equation, which holds for every row of the
table:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><var>table-width</var> = <var>border-width</var><sub>0</sub> +
<var>padding-left</var><sub>1</sub> + <var>width</var><sub>1</sub> +
<var>padding-right</var><sub>1</sub> +
<var>border-width</var><sub>1</sub> +
<var>padding-left</var><sub>2</sub> +...+
<var>padding-right</var><sub><var>n</var></sub> +
<var>border-width</var><sub><var>n</var></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here <var>n</var> is the number of cells in the row, and
<var>border-width</var><sub><var>i</var></sub> refers to the border
between cells <var>i</var> and <var>i</var> + 1.</p>

<p><img src="images/tbl-width.gif" alt="Schema showing the widths of cells and borders and the padding of cells"></p>

<p>Note that in this model, the width of the table includes half the
table border. Also, in this model, a table doesn't have padding but
does have margins.

<h4><a name="border-conflict-resolution">Border conflict resolution</a></h4>

<p>In the collapsing border model, borders in the same location may
be generated by a variety of elements (cells, rows, row groups,
columns, column groups, and the table itself), and these borders
may vary in width, style, and color. The following rules determine
which border "wins" in case of a conflict:</p>

<ol>
<li>Borders with the <span
class="propinst-border-style">'border-style'</span> of 'hidden'
take precedence over all other conflicting borders. Any border
with this value suppresses all borders at this location.
</li>

<li>Borders on 'table' and 'table-inline' elements take 
precedence over borders on any other table elements.</li>


<!-- I changed this. Shouldn't cells take precedence over
rows? You want to be able to specify the border around a
particular cell, and have it stand out from the surrounding row.
Maybe I'm wrong! -IJ -->
<li>Borders on 'table-cell' elements take precedence
over those for row, row group, column, and column group elements.</li>

<li>Borders on 'row-group' elements take precedence over borders on
'rows', and likewise, borders on 'column-group' elements
take precedence over borders on 'columns'.</li>

<li>If the conflicting borders come from the same element type, the
wider of the two borders is used (the <span
class="propinst-border-width">'border-width'</span> property).
"Wider" takes into account the border-style of 'none', so a "1px
solid" border will take precedence over a "20px none" border.</li>

<li>Otherwise, if two or more borders have the same largest width but different
styles (the <span class="propinst-border-style">'border-style'</span>
property), the one with a style nearest the start of the following
list establishes the final style and color: 'hidden', 'double',
'solid', 'dashed', 'dotted', 'ridge', 'groove', 'none'. If the style
is 'outset', it will be drawn as 'ridge' instead, and 'inset' will be
drawn as 'groove'.

<li>Otherwise, if two or more borders differ only in color (the <span
class="propinst-border-color">'border-color'</span> property), a color
different from the <span class="propinst-color">'color'</span>
property of the two cells on either side will be preferred over a
color that only differs from one of the cells, which in turn will be
chosen over a border that doesn't differ in color from the cells.  If
none of these rules determine the color of the border, the user agent
may choose any one of the colors.
</ol>

<!-- Another possible rule, that tries to make sure thinner
borders never interrupt thicker ones: if <em>any</em> of the
coincident border is 'hidden', use that; otherwise, if <em>all</em> of
the coincident borders are 'none', use that; otherwise take the widest
border among the non-'none' styles; if there is more than one, prefer
'double' over 'solid' over 'dashed' over 'dotted ' over 'inset' over
'outset' over 'ridge over 'groove'. If there is still a conflict
(which must be in the color), the result is undefined.
-->

<p>The chosen border is drawn using its normal width, style and
color. Other coincident border edges are <b>not</b> drawn underneath,
in the case of partially transparent border styles (e.g. 'double'
borders, which have a transparent gap). </p>

<div class="example">
<P>The following example illustrates the application
of these precedence rules. This style sheet:</p>

<pre>
TABLE          { border: 5px solid yellow; }
*#col1         { border: 1px solid black; }
TD             { border: 5px solid red; }
TD.solid-blue  { border: 11px solid blue; }
TD.solid-green { border: 7px solid green; }
}

<h2>Audio rendering of tables</h2>
<p>When a table is spoken by a speech generator, the relation between
the data cells and the header cells must be expressed in a different
way than by horizontal and vertical alignment. Some speech browsers
may allow a user to move around in the 2-dimensional space, thus
giving them the opportunity to map out the spatially represented
relations. When that is not possible, the style sheet must specify at
which points the headers are spoken.</p>

<h3><a name="speak-headers">Speaking headers:</a> the <span
class="propinst-speak-header">'speak-header'</span> property</h3>


<!-- #include src=properties/speak-header.srb -->

<P>This property specifies whether table headers
are spoken before every
cell, or only before a cell when that cell is associated with a
different header than the previous cell. Values have
the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>once</strong>
<dd>The header is spoken one time, before a series of
cells.
<dt><strong>always</strong>
<dd>The header is before every pertinent cell.
</dl>

<!-- 
<p>[Add speak:header-cell|data-cell, and some way to mirror the
axis/headers attributes? -BB]

[Perhaps rename 'speak-cell'? -IJ]

</p>

<!-- I propose this instead of requiring the mechanism
to be that of HTML 4.0 -IJ -->
<p>Each document language may have different mechanisms that allow
authors to specify headers. For example, in <a rel="biblioentry"
href="./refs.html#ref-HTML40">[HTML40]</a>, it is possible
to specify header information with three
different attributes ("headers", "scope", and "axis"), and
the specification gives an algorithm for determining header
information when these attributes have not been specified.</p>

<p>By providing the data model in this way, authors make it
possible for speech enabled-browsers to explore the table in
rich ways, e.g. each cell could be spoken as a list, repeating the
applicable headers before each data cell:</p>

<pre>
  San Jose, 25-Aug-97, Meals:  37.74
  San Jose, 25-Aug-97, Hotels:  112.00
  San Jose, 25-Aug-97, Transport:  45.00
 ...
</pre>

<p>The browser could also speak the headers only when they change:</p>

<pre>
San Jose, 25-Aug-97, Meals: 37.74
    Hotels: 112.00
    Transport: 45.00
  26-Aug-97, Meals: 27.28
    Hotels: 112.00
...
</pre>
