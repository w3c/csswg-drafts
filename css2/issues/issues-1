CSS2.1 Last Call: Disposition of Comments
=======================================================================

This issues list covers issues in the Last Call Working Draft
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/

==> There are open issues. Search for *WG*.

Search for lines starting with one of the following to find issues
that need work:

   *Bert*     -- Task for Bert to do (3 remaining)
   *Ian*      -- Task for Ian to do (1 remaining)

"Further communication is required" means we have yet to send an
e-mail reply. "Document to be updated" means we still need to make
changes to the spec based on decisions the group has made. "NOTE:" is
a note by Ian based on what was noticed during issue checking.

When discussing issues, please refer to them by issue number. The
numbers used here are the numbers we will use in the final disposition
of comments (assuming I'm the one who writes that, which would seem
sensible).

When replying to or following up on e-mails mentioned below, please cc
either www-style or w3c-css-wg, and include [CSS21] in the subject
line and the issue number somewhere clearly labelled either in the
subject line or the body. This will significantly aid my ability to
keep track of what issues have been dealt with and which still require
a formal reply from the working group.

========================================================================
Issue 1. "For 'top' and 'bottom', if the height of the containing
block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content
height), the percentage value is interpreted like 'auto'." in the
definition of <percentage> for top/right/bottom/left is probably
wrong.
Resolution: MacIE, WinIE, Safari, and Mozilla do this proposal. so,
strike the sentence: "For 'top' and 'bottom', if the height of the
containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on
content height), the percentage value is interpreted like 'auto'." in
section 9.3.2 near the end under <percentage>.

Issue 2. "If the height of the containing block is not specified
explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), and this element is
not absolutely positioned, the value is interpreted like 'auto'." in
the definition of <percentage> for height is probably wrong.
Resolution: Issue retracted.

Issue 6. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2003JulSep/0371.html
(e-mail from Tantek, see note near bottom)
Resolution: Change the titles as follows:
 10.6.3 Block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow when
        'overflow' computes to 'visible'
 10.6.6 Block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow when
        'overflow' does not compute to 'visible'; 'inline-block',
        non-replaced elements; and floating, non-replaced elements.

Issue 7. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2003JulSep/0372.html
[margin collapsing / clear issue]
Resolution: Add this text after the "An element's own margins"
paragraph in 8.3.1:
"When an element's own margins collapse, and that element has had
clearance applied to it, its top margin collapses with the adjoining
margins of subsequent siblings but that resulting margin does not
collapse with the bottom margin of the parent block".
Testcase: http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/images/016.html
Safari and MacIE do this as proposed.
WinIE behaviour is inexplicable.

Issue 8. "'float', 'height' (if 'float' is not 'none'), 'width' (if
'float' is not 'none')" are missing from the list of properties that
apply to ':first-letter

Issue 9. http://www.w3.org/mid/3F87E607.9030501@escape.com
background-position: The following should be dropped: "The computed
value of background-position for the purpose of inheritance is
undefined, since the allowed values on this property may have
different effects in a child element due to differences in size and
position of their respective boxes." (it's defined now)

Issue 15b. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2003Sep/0106.html
Text of CR exit criteria.
[for the last one, propose we say "If we make such changes, we will go
back to last call for a quick review period, then skip CR (since we
will be able to show interoperability straight away)" - ian]
This is due to section 7.4.3 of the process document:
<dbaron> http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/tr.html#cfi
<dbaron> "In the Call for Implementations, the Working Group MAY
identify specific features of the technical report as being "features
at risk." General statements such as "We plan to remove any
unimplemented feature" are not acceptable; the Working Group MUST
precisely identify any features at risk. Thus, in response to a Call
for Implementations, reviewers can indicate whether they would
formally object to the removal of the identified features."
Resolution: Change part 4 of the CREC to read:
4. Features that were not in CSS1 will be dropped (thus reducing the
   list of "all" features mentioned above) if two or more
   interoperable implementations of those features are not found by
   the end of the CR period.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 18a. 'fixed' in section 10.1 (visudet/containing block) is defined as:
# If the element has 'position: fixed', the containing block is
# established by the viewport.
...but in section 9.3.1 (visuren/position) is defined as:
# In the case of the print media type, the box is fixed with respect
# to the page, even if that page is seen through a viewport (in the
# case of a print-preview, for example).
...(without saying that it occurs on every page) and in section 9.6.1
(visuren/fixed positioning) as:
# For paged media, boxes with fixed positions are repeated on every
# page.
These three definitions need to be made consistent.
Resolution: Change 10.1 item 3 to read: "If the element has 'position:
fixed', the containing block is established by the viewport <ins>in
the case of continuous media or the page box in the case of paged
media.</ins>".
Document updated.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 18b. Also, it needs to be clear whether position:fixed elements
appear on "earlier" pages or not too. (I (ian) think they should. It's
the only logical way of looking at it IMHO. Especially given what we
said about position: absolute.)
Resolution: Retracted.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 19. We have no way of positioning something relative to the page
and only render it on one page. Is that a problem? Should we
explicitly say we don't support that?
Resolution: Move to CSS3.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 20. If you can relatively position table cells / columns /
column groups / rows / row groups (or give them 'opacity', it doesn't
matter -- anything that either moves them, or makes them generate a
stacking context), then, er, good lord. Can we disallow that? If we
don't, we need to define the stacking context algorithm for that.
Resolution: Add "The effect of a 'position: relative' declaration on
table-row-group, table-header-group, table-footer-group, table-row,
table-column-group, table-column, table-cell, and table-caption
elements is undefined." to 9.3.1 Choosing a positioning scheme:
'position' property.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 21. The diagram at the bottom of 9.5 (before 9.5.1) is wrong now.
Resolution: Assumed agreement.
Document updated.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 22. I think we should explicitly say in the paragraph in 9.5.1
reading "If the element's top border edge has not passed the relevant
floats, then its clearance is set to the amount necessary to place the
border edge of the block even with the bottom outer edge of the lowest
float that must be cleared." that "The collapsing of earlier margins
is affected by this, and indeed the float could move as a result."
See, e.g., http://www.damowmow.com/playground/bugs/204831/001.html
       vs. http://www.damowmow.com/playground/bugs/204831/002.html
The float in the first should be lower than in the second.
Note: The proposed text needs a tweak actually. We need to say
that it is the final position of the float that decides where
everything should go. IMHO. - ian
Resolution: Don't change it at all.
Issue closed.

Issue 23. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2003Sep/0134.html
| Section 1.4.2, "Applies To" paragraph
| This should probably say "elements with display:table" instead of "table
| elements" (since the latter typically means "elements with a tag name of
| 'table'").
Resolution: We don't think it's ambiguous because single quotes mean
CSS keywords by convention. No change.

Issue 24. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2003Sep/0134.html
| Section 1.4.5
| "after" may be better than "to the right".  For example, in aural rendering,
| this would be the case....
| I can't check how this actually renders in various UAs because a quick look at
| the section of the specification with the most images (Chapter 9) doesn't show
| any images provided with a long description link as described... (and none have
| a "longdesc" attribute).
Resolution: Assumed agreement.

| http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/visuren.html#q15
| The new first paragraph in block formatting context is good and makes
| me think i understand the questions i had on floats earlier. However,
| i think an example or two would be helpful to more clearly show for
| instance how an element that generates a new block formatting context
| affects its containing blocks size when the containing block also
| generates a new block formatting context (is this described somewhere
| else? I failed to find it if so). I also think some kind of more
| explicit pointer to this effect should be supplied in the calculating
| widths/heights sections (or is the effect seen more as an implicit
| min-width/min-height?).
Resolution: We don't think an example would necessarily be useful.
This would be more useful in a tutorial than a spec.

| http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/visuren.html#floats
| The new paragraph on how the margin box of a block that generates a
| new block formatting context interacts with floats in the same block
| context is helpful, but i think perhaps the effect of a float nested
| inside an element wich generates a new block formatting context along
| with more examples would help even further (eg a float in a table
| cell). The way things in the draft are currently written the example
| under the paragraph probably belongs to the previous paragraph, which
| could be a bit confusing.
Resolution: See the upcoming test suite for some examples.

| http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/visuren.html#floats
| The paragraph is a little vague on how to handle the conflict between
| a float and another block that generates a new block formatting
| context when they are in the same block formatting context. Why not
| require that the box is cleared? When is it desirable to position it
| adjacent, creating a kind of a "pseudo-float"?
Resolution: Because thats what UAs interoperably do, and the adjacent
position is desirable if there is enough room.

| Section 4.1.1
| <http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/syndata.html#tokenization>
| Is it intended that '_' be a valid "ident" production?  At the moment it is.  So is
| '-_', for that matter.  Perhaps the "ident" production should be defined as:
|   ident    [-_]?{nmstart}{nmchar}
| and the "nmstart" definition retained as it was in CSS2
| ([a-zA-Z]|{nonascii}|{escape}) ?  No strong feelings either way here, it's just
| that the current proposal seems a bit odd.
Resolution: It's odd but it works and we're happy with it, so, let's keep it.

| <http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/syndata.html#tokenization>
| Is there a reason that CDO and CDC are allowed at all places in the stylesheet

| that CDO/CDC be allowed in linked stylesheets?  They would seem very out of
| place there....  Perhaps I am misunderstanding what this is actually saying; if
| so, perhaps an informative note is in order to clarify the situation?
Resolution: It's odd but it works and we're happy with it, so, let's keep it.

|    double quotes (") appearing in a URI must be escaped with a
|    backslash: '\(', '\)', '\,'.
| is misleading, since they in fact do not have to be escaped if the URI string
| is in quotes.  Also, it is not immediately clear to me why commas are included
| in the list.  Is there a reason.
Resolution: Add "unquoted" before "URI" in that quoted text. Commas
are escaped for future expansion.

Issue 42. http://www.w3.org/mid/200309281922.h8SJMG9O014121@nerd-xing.mit.edu
| Section 4.3.4
| <http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/syndata.html#uri>
| What happens if the URI string is not a syntactically valid URI?  For example:
|   url(http:/www.example.com/)
| or something along those lines?  Does this affect the parsing or style
| computation phase, or is this handled only when the resource actually needs to
| be loaded, thus falling under the "User agents may vary" clause at the end of
| the section?

(Original resolution: Computed <uri>s are the given specified URI,
except if it is a relative URI in which case the computed URI is the
absolute URI. Add to the end of the second paragraph of 6.1.2, "The
computed value for a valid relative URI is its absolute equivalent;
for other URIs, the computed value is as specified.". Invalid URIs are
not CSS syntax errors. We will also add "invalid URIs or" between
"handle" and "URIs" in the "user agents may vary" clause in 4.3.4.)

Resolution: Add "invalid URIs or" between "handle" and "URIs" in the
"user agents may vary" clause in 4.3.4.

Resolution changed due to issue resolution conflict. See:

| The language
|   Double quotes cannot occur inside double quotes, unless escaped (as '\"' or
|   as '\22').
| is somewhat misleading, since there are other ways that a quote could be
| escaped (eg using \000022).  Perhaps an "e.g.," at the beginning of the
| parenthetical remark is in order?  Same for single quotes.

| Section 4.4
| < http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/syndata.html#q23>
| What about stylesheets that have a BOM but no @charset rule?  Should the
| presence of a BOM imply that the sheet is encoded as, eg UTF-8 or UTF-16LE (if
| the appropriate BOM is present), as it does for XML?
Original resolution: We should allow UAs to either ignore BOMs, or
handle BOMs in the absence of other encoding information.
Resolution: Accept the proposed changes but make sure the six (title,
two in 4.4, three in 4.4.1) occurances of "document" that mean "style
sheet" are changed to say "style sheet". Also replace "("big-endian"
or "little-endian")" with "(e.g. "big-endian" or "little-endian")".

| Another point is that it's trivial to have a stylesheet for which steps 1, 2, 3
| will give no useful charset value.  In fact, the vast majority of stylesheets
| currently on the web fall into this category.  Is the behavior UA-dependent in
| that case?  If so, this should be explicitly stated, I think.  Personally, I
| think it would be worthwhile to specify behavior in that eventuality.
Resolution: It's UA dependent.

| <http://www.w3.org/Style/css2-updates/WD-CSS21-20030915-diff/selector.html#first-child>
| This needs to define what a "first child" is.  From what I can tell, the intent
| is to match elements that would match both the "* > *" and "* + *" selectors.
| In particular, the <span> in both examples below would match :first-child:
|    <p>This is a <span>test.</span></p>
|    <p><!-- Of the emergency --> broadcast system</p>
| Perhaps something like, "The :first-child pseudo-class matches an element node

| If an element is hovered, are its ancestors considered hovered?  Is this

| The example used is somewhat unfortunate because it encourages using selectors
| like "a:hover" which don't do quite what page authors expect based on this

Daniel says: Similarly, how about columns.
Resolution: Leaving this undefined for CSS21:

| Section 5.12.2 (The :first-letter pseudo-element)
| The last paragraph of the example with the floated 'T' says:
|   Note that the :first-letter pseudo-element tags abut the content (i.e., the
|   initial character), while the :first-line pseudo-element start tag is
|   inserted right after the start tag of the element to which it is attached.
| I'm not sure what this means, in light of the example for :first-line, in which
| we get the fictional tag sequence: <div><p><div:first-line><p:first-line> ...
| This section should also make it clear that given markup like:
|    <div>
|    <p>
|    Some text
|    more text
|    </p>
|    </div>
| with the linebreak occurring where I show it, the fictional tag sequence is:
|    <div><p>
|      <div:first-line><p:first-line>
|        <div:first-letter><p:first-letter>S</p:first-letter></div:first-letter>omeText
|      </div:first-line></p:first-line>
|      more text
|    </p></div>
| because right now, it only makes clear the interaction of first-letter and
| first-line when both are set on the same element, and does not specify the
| ordering of p:first-line and div:first-letter in the above example.

| In the CSS2.1 Default HTML Style sheet:
|    http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/sample.html
| It still says that CSS2.1 cannot fully express the presentation
| of elements like img and frame. Yet CSS3 can, like so:
|    img, object, applet, embed, iframe, frame, frameset {
|      display:inline-block;
|    }
|    -- http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-css3-ui-20030703/#qA
| With the introduction of inline-block to CSS2.1, it can in fact

Reply: http://www.w3.org/mid/20030929175350.GA4936@darby.dbaron.org

| The example list of overflow cases includes:

| Even though this list is not meant to be comprehensive, I suggest we

|   - A descendent box is relatively positioned, causing it to be positioned
|   partly outside the box.
| And change:
|   "An element's height exceeds"
| to
|   "An element's height (or line-height) exceeds"
| I think it's also possible that vertical-align of an absolute length

Internal Reply: http://www.w3.org/mid/20031001001902.GA3745@darby.dbaron.org
| I'd prefer not to mention line-height here, since I don't think the
| logical box considered by line-height should be considered to be
| overflow.  I think only the box generated by the font edge, padding,
| border (and margin?) should be considered overflow.  That doesn't mean
| that the line-height couldn't cause overflow by increasing the height of
| a block, but the existing text accounts for that.  If that's what you
| meant by the addition of the parenthetical comment, I'd rather not say
| that because I think it could be misinterpreted.
|
| Perhaps we should define what counts as overflow a little more clearly.
| For example, we could say whether it's the border-box, the margin-box,
| or the union of the two that defines the part of a box considered when
| computing overflow.  Mozilla does border-box, and it would be rather
| difficult to change.  Saying that it's only the margin-box would
| probably be a bad idea because of negative margins.  The existing text
| isn't clear at all, and could be interpreted as undefined, as
| content-box, or perhaps as margin-box.

| This reminds me of a question I had about relative positioning and

| (once offset) constitutes overflow, and if overflow is set to auto, are
| you supposed to show scrollbars in order to scroll to the object?
|
| If you do show scrollbars, then you have just affected the layout of
| the object that follows you, despite the fact that the spec says you
| should not.  Right now, when deciding whether or not to show
| scrollbars, Safari actually looks at the untranslated position and so
| Safari will not provide the ability to scroll to see the relative
| positioned content, but I suspect this might be different from other
| browsers.

| Section 8.1 (Box Dimensions)
| <http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/box.html#box-dimensions>
| The description of "content edge or inner edge" makes it sound like this edge
| always surrounds the "rendered content"; the latter term is sort of vaguely
| defined.  The overall impression given is that given the markup:
|    <div style="height: 1px">
|    line<br>
|    line2
|    </div>
| the "content edge or inner edge" will surround both lines (which is of course
| not the case).
| I hesitate to suggest a better wording offhand, though...  Perhaps "content
| area" instead of "rendered content", with a link to a few paragraphs below
| where it says "The dimensions of the content area of a box ..."?
Resolution: Not a problem since 8.1 is rather vague anyway.

Proposal: A simple proposal to fix this issue is to change:

  The content edge surrounds the element's rendered content.

to:

  The content edge surrounds the rectangle given by the width and height
  of the box, which often depend on the element's rendered content.

(Note that "width" and "height" are not links to properties, since that
would be inappropriate for some types of boxes, but they could be links
to sections 10.3 and 10.6.)

Section 8.1 (Box Dimensions)
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/box.html#box-dimensions>

The definition of "box width" given in this section gives me some pause.  The
only mentions of the term "box width" in chapters 8-18 of the specification
(other than this definition) are:

A)  A statement immediately preceding that says that box widths are explained
    in a later chapter.
B)  Discussion of percent values for left/right (section 9.3.1 Choosing a
    positioning scheme: 'position' property).  The prose there says these
    are percentages of the "containing block's box width"; is it really intended
    that he containing block's margin's affect the offset from the padding edge in
    this case, per the definition of "box width"?
C)  Discussion of min-width/max-width (10.4 Minimum and maximum widths:
    'min-width' and 'max-width').  The prose here says that these properties
    constrain "box widths".... except that's not true according to the Section
    8.1 definition of "box width".  They constrain content widths.
D)  A reference to "page box width" in chapter 13.  This also seems to want the
    content width.

In short, there is no usage of this term in this specification that is
consistent with the definition.  I suggest striking the definition and changing
the two uses to refer to content widths, since that seems to be the desired
effect.

The "box height" seems similarly useless.

Resolution: Remove definition of box width and box height (A),
Document updated.

Resolution: change occurrences B (remove "box")
Document updated.

Resolution: and C (use "content width" instead of "box width").

Resolution: D is referring to the {{page box} width} not the {page
{box width}}.

"The height of each LI box is given by its content height, plus top and bottom
padding, borders, and margins."  What does that mean, exactly?  That is, what
does "the height of each LI box" in real terms?  The exampls does not really
say what this quantity (which is not even well-defined in the presence of
margin collapsing) is used for.

Resolution: Only an example.

Section 8.3.1 (Collapsing margins)
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/box.html>
  "Collapsing is based on the computed value of 'padding', 'margin', and
  'border'."
The computed value of margin properties is "the percentage as specified or the
absolute length".  What exactly does it mean for collapsing be based on the
computed value if that can be "the percentage as specified"?  Especially if the
collapsing margins belong to boxes with different containing blocks (and hence
different meanings of percentage values)?
Resolution: Changed "computed" to "used".

What you're saying here is that a "rule" is also a "set of rules".

# A declaration-block (also called a {}-block in the following text)
# starts with a left curly brace ({) and ends with the matching right

Is there a particular reason why "declaration-blocks" are not defined in
terms of "blocks" (as defined in the previous section)?

And don't call it a {}-block. @media rules have braces-delimited blocks,
too. Just call it a declaration block. It's a nice, unambiguous term;
there's nothing wrong with it.

# CSS also allows the SGML comment delimiters ("<!--" and "-->") in

# See the HTML 4.0 specification ([HTML40]) for more information.

It says SGML comment delimiters are allowed "in certain places". Very
mysterious-like, especially considering the amount of detail about
HTML. Why not say where exactly?
And why is the definitive CSS document referring to the HTML 4.0 spec
for details about CSS syntax? Or is the "more information" more
information about hiding from pre-HTML 3.2 user agents, not "more
information" about, like, where the comment delimiters may be placed?

| CSS does not fully describe the result if the tallest (in full

| I think the best would be to treat the largest element (in full

then (vertically) shrink wrap the line box around that and stack it in
with the other line boxes. -- Hixie)

This is false. The selector will be used for all cases, not just the
default case. If a declaration from this rule conflicts with one from
a more specific rule, then it will be overridden--but the declaration
still applies.

Class Selectors
S5.8.3 <http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/selector.html#class-html>:
# Working with HTML, authors may use the period (.) notation as an
# alternative to the ~= notation when representing the class
# attribute. Thus, for HTML, div.value and div[class~=value] have the
# same meaning. The attribute value must immediately follow the
# "period" (.). UAs may apply selectors using the period (.) notation
# in XML documents if the UA has namespace specific knowledge that
# allows it to determine which attribute is the "class" attribute for
# the respective namespace. One such example of namespace specific
# knowledge is the prose in the specification for a particular
# namespace (e.g. SVG 1.0 [SVG10] describes the SVG "class" attribute
# and how a UA should interpret it, and similarly MathML 2.0 [MATH20]
# describes the MathML "class" attribute.)
The poor quality of the prose here aside (which I'll have to address
later), I think this paragraph would benefit from a brief discussion
of what a class /is/ conceptually, not just syntactically.

Class Selectors
S5.8.3 <http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/selector.html#class-html>:
Also, you need to make clear that an XML namespace may choose as its
class attribute an attribute with a name other than "class".
# Note. CSS gives so much power to the "class" attribute, that authors
# could conceivably design their own "document language" based on
# elements with almost no associated presentation (such as DIV and
# SPAN in HTML) and assigning style information through the "class"
# attribute. Authors should avoid this practice since the structural
# elements of a document language often have recognized and accepted
# meanings and author-defined classes may not.
You tell authors here what not to do with classes. One reads this
warning, but then what? There's no advice on what *to* do! Tantek's
post "A Touch of Class" [1] explains classes particularly well; adding
a few key points from that would turn this block into a more useful

# Document languages may contain attributes that are declared to be of

# such attributes can have the same value; whatever the document
# language, an ID attribute can be used to uniquely identify its

Since CSS could conceivably be used for a non-SGML-based document
language, I suggest defining IDs as "unique identifiers" first and
relating them to type ID later. Another advantage is that you start
the definition with generic English rather than specific code.

Resolution: Not a problem currently. Will fix it in Selectors when it
is a problem.

Link Pseudo-Classes
S5.11.2 <http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/selector.html#link-pseudo-classes>
# Note. It is possible for stylesheet authors to abuse the :link and
# :visited pseudo-classes to determine which sites a user has visited
# without the user's consent. UAs may therefore treat all links as
# unvisited links, or implement other measures to preserve the user's
# privacy while rendering visited and unvisited links differently. See
# [P3P] for more information about handling privacy.
If you want to let UAs treat all links as unvisited, then put that in
the normative prose, not an informative note. As for privacy concerns
over :visited and :link, putting that kind of a note in here seems
like overkill to me.

Resolution: split note at "UAs may", second paragraph being normative.
Further communication is required.

:first-line
This entire section takes the "fictional tag sequence" idea
a bit too literally. For example,
# the user agent could generate the appropriate start and
# end tags for SPAN when inserting the fictional tag
# sequence for :first-line.
No. You can't make the tags real, because then you wind up
with an obscure box model. Suppose, for example, I specify
span { border: 1px solid}. The border shouldn't indicate a
split in the span element at the end of the first line.

Resolution: Change "generate the appropriate" ("user agent could
generate the appropriate start and end tags") to "simulate" or other
wording at editor's discretion.

What do you mean, the "smallest enclosing block-level
element"?
If you're trying to say something about nesting (I'm
guessing based on the example), then *say* something
about nesting. E.g.
    :first-line pseudo-elements are nested in the
    same order as the elements themselves.

Issue 94. Name of initial value of 'content'.
Comment: http://www.w3.org/mid/3F879150.9020504@escape.com
| I propose changing the 'normal' value to 'auto':
Comment: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2003Mar/0013.html
| It should also be renamed to 'auto', as 'auto' means "self"--
| which is a connotation you'll want in CSS3. It also means
| "automatic"; the content and behavior associated with the
| element is "automatic" instead of manually specified in the
| style rule. In contrast, 'normal' here means little more
| than 'default', and it implies that any other value is
| "abnormal". ;)
|
| If the WG still feels 'normal' is more appropriate than 'auto',
| I would *really* like to know why. *formally requests a reply*

Resolution: Tantek prefers "normal" and none of the rest of us really
care either way.

|

|    not apply. In this case, the element generates no box.
|
| 2. Otherwise, if 'position' has the value 'absolute' or 'fixed', the
|    box is absolutely positioned, the computed value of 'float' is
|    'none', and display is set according to the table below. The
|    position of the box will be determined by the 'top', 'right',
|    'bottom' and 'left' properties and the box's containing block.
|
| 3. Otherwise, if 'float' has a value other than 'none', the box is
|    floated and 'display' is set according to the table below.
|
| 4. Otherwise, if the element is the root element, 'display' is set
|    according to the table below.

| More generally, I find the character numbering a little confusing. It
| is in fact self-consistent, but it is not obvious to the reader
| without some checking and if you don't recognize the values.
|
| If you take into account:
|
| -In 4.1.1 Tokenization it is mentioned that Octal codes refer to ISO 10646.
| (This is specific to Lex expressions but that is not immediately obvious. I
| realize saying octal refers to 10646 doesn't mean that the reverse is true,
| 10646 codes will be in octal. But it doesn't mean it isn't true either.)
|
| -The character codes at the end of 4.1.1 are decimal. Although one code (space)
| is identified as a Unicode value.
|
| -All of the escapes are of course hex.
|
| Then, when you read in section 4.1.3 that ISO 10646 characters 161 and higher
| are allowed in identifiers, it is not immediately obvious if 161 is octal,
| decimal or hex.
|
| It would perhaps be more clear to use the Unicode notation for character codes:
| U+hhhh, as the hex notation is more common now and the U+ is distinctive and
| indicative of the notation. The hex values are more recognizable as well, for
| characters like ideographic space, etc.
| and fit in better with the escape notation.

Can we reference IRIs? I thought that hadn't reached last call yet. We
can't reference something that is still a draft.

Resolution: A CR can't reference anything before a last call, and IRIs
i8
aren't last call.

Issue 120. http://www.w3.org/mid/3F8DBE91.7A3671E@i18nguy.com
| The section 4.3.7 on strings introduces \A for newline and points to
| an example, so I assume there isn't a section describing other
| backslash codes (e.g. \t etc.). However, the section doesn't define
| what the user should do if they actually want a linefeed.
|
| Is \0A (not \A) supposed to generate a linefeed or a newline? In other
| words, is that string "\A" a special string, or is the character code
| U+000A mapped to linefeed in css? The parenthetical remark seems to
| indicate that CSS redefines the Unicode character.
|
| (Which seems like a very odd and dangerous thing to do.)

Resolution: Make :lang() undefined in 2.1 (we'll define in CSS3+) In
addition, specify that :lang()'s argument must be an identifier as it
says in the grammar. This also needs changing the grammar to allow
function-like pseudo-classes with null arguments.

|
| For example the letter i uses different conversion values in Turkey,

| I guess if the AND is intentional, you are saying that it is better to

Unlike class selectors, the id selectors are defined to depend on the

reasonably be expected not to process the external DTD subset.
Therefore, id selectors when used with XHTML would fail in most if not
all Web browsers. I suggest allowing the UA to have hard-coded

14.3 Gamma correction

" Mac using QuickDraw

I think assuming a particular gamma based on platform is harmful. The
display gamma is configurable on the Mac. When the user agent and
doesn't really know the display gamma, I think it would be better not
to try to "correct" it.  Applying "corrections" based on guesses has
been harmful in connection to the PNG format.
See http://iki.fi/hsivonen/png-gamma.html

"(ColorSync-savvy applications may simply pass the sRGB ICC profile to
ColorSync to perform correct color correction)"

The ICC rendering intent is not specified. If a PNG image where is
marked to be in the sRGB color space, which rendering intent should be
specified in order to match CSS colors in a User Agent that does color
matching based on ICC profiles?

15.2 Font matching algorithm

I think the specification is too detailed here. When the page isn't
displayed with the font the author primarily wanted, do this specifics
of the font matching really matter? For example, on Mac OS X ATSUI
already implements a font matching algorithm which could be considered
good enough. Having to implement another matching algorithm on the
application level is a performance problem. Consideration
implementation difficulty, performance and the user experience, I think
passing the list of font alternatives to the system Unicode imaging
service and letting the system apply its fallback algorithm would be
quite sufficient when the system offers font list-based fallback
functionality. Also, considering user experience, allowing (but not
requiring) the user agent to make decisions based on the content of the
entire page is likely to be better than doing per character font

S6.2: Inheritance

# When inheritance occurs, elements inherit computed values. The
# computed value from the parent element becomes both the specified
# value and the computed value on the child.
...
# Each property may also have a specified value of 'inherit', which
# means that, for a given element, the property takes the same
# computed value as the property for the element's parent.

There's a dichotomy in how the "specified value" for inherited values
works, depending on whether it's explicit or implied. It would be best
if the initial behavior of 'color' and "color: inherit" meant exactly
the same thing. And this way the meaning of "color: inherit" on the
root element would follow from the inheritance logic without having to
be handled as another exception.

is clearly presentational. Trying to deny this is silly. What you
/want/ to do is to restrict the special handling of presentational

# Relative and absolute positioning may be used to implement change
# bars, as shown in the following example.
# ... the change bars seem to "float" to the left of the current line.

Wouldn't it make more sense to use a float?

(It's basically saying the same thing in two different ways: the
widths are determined from the root element down to the inner most
elements, via the containing block hierarchy.)

# margin-top, margin-bottom
# Applies to: all elements but inline, non-replaced elements and
#             internal table elements

Any reason why it doesn't need to apply to inline, non-replaced
elements? Borders and padding do; they just don't have an effect
on line-height calculation. Since that seems to be the rationale
for excluding it, I'd just combine the definitions for all margins
and leave the no-effect part to the inline model explanation.

Resolution: Assumed disagreement by Ian, David, Bert. Vertical margins
don't apply to non-replaced inlines because they have absolutely no
effect, and it is easier to explain this by saying "they don't apply"
than "well they apply, they just don't do anything".

I think it is indeed an oversight that nothing is said about

Issue 202. http://www.w3.org/mid/B2901A91-05A3-11D8-A7F5-000A958E6110@apple.com
Does first-line apply to list-items and table-cells as well as blocks?

(Original resolution: Yes, :first-line DOES apply to list-items and
table-cells as well as blocks. The effect of :first-line on list item
markers is undefined in CSS2.1. See
http://tantek.com/w3c/css/litdfirstline.html for tests and results.)

Hyatt says: Does first-letter apply only to block flows like
list-items, table cells, and blocks? I'd prefer it if it did, i.e., if
it was applicable only to the same set of elements that first-line is
applicable to. It doesn't make sense to me to apply it to inlines,
since an inline element could be right in the middle of a word. The
term "first-letter" sort of loses its meaning if it could be applied
to inlines.

Tantek says: I think first-letter can make sense in many inline
contexts, like the start of a sentence. I have seen the first-letter
of some inline spans (like words) boldened in a few instances in some
publications. In CSS3 Selectors we made the deliberate choice to allow
first-letter to apply to *all elements* for this reason. However, for
CSS2.1 I am fine with saying that :first-letter, like :first-line, can
only be attached to a block-level element. See
http://tantek.com/w3c/css/inlinefirstletter.html for tests and
results.

Ian says: I think we should make apply only to blocks in 2.1 too.

Bert says: No opinion.

Resolution: Doesn't apply to inlines in 2.1

Issue 204. http://www.w3.org/mid/B2901A91-05A3-11D8-A7F5-000A958E6110@apple.com

Hyatt says: Do first-line and first-letter cross from blocks into
inline blocks? For the former, I'd say "No", since that doesn't make
much sense, and so i'd like to say "No" for first-letter as well in
order to be consistent.

<div><span style="display:inline-block">Hello</span></div>

In the above, I'd like a first-letter/line style on the div not to
apply to "Hello" at all.

Tantek says: Proposed resolution: Accept. I agree that descendant
inline-blocks (and floats and positioned elements and tables and table
cells etc.) should *not* get first-line(letter) styling from a block
parent whose first-line(letter) was selected. See
http://tantek.com/w3c/css/firstlinefloatinlineblock.html for tests of
first-line in particular and results.

Resolution: Agreed. :first-line doesn't _apply_ to the inline-block
(you stop propagating the "pseudo-elementness" when you hit a line
box, basically, so :first-line only applies to one line). (Note,
however, that we don't define if styles set on the :first-line should
/inherit/ into inline-blocks on the first line. That's undefined in
2.1 because we don't know what is best yet.)

-- Section 9.2.1 (Anonymous block boxes)
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030915/visuren.html#anonymous-block-level>

The example talks about having a "anonymous block box for BODY".  I'm not sure
what this means.  Since the BODY is an inline inside a block (HTML), and the
boxes of BODY end up with a block sibling (the P), I would expect an anonymous
block _around_ the BODY boxes.  But the boxes of BODY should be inline.

This example should probably be clarified.

Resolution: "anonymous block box for BODY" should be "anonymous block
box around the BODY".

Issue 206. http://www.w3.org/mid/200310270540.h9R5ehJv016652@nerd-xing.mit.edu
The part about being turned into anonymous block boxes that follows
the example is also confusing.... What does it mean for the border of
the BODY to apply in this case? The spec sounds like it should draw
two block-like borders -- one around the anonymous block containing
C1, one around the anonymous block containing C2.

David, Bert: This is editorial.

Tantek: It seems to me that the inline border from BODY may also be
drawn around the P (in addition to C1 and C2), due to wrapping of the
P with an anonymous inline. See
http://tantek.com/w3c/css/CSS21_921_eg2_bodyinline.html for online
version of the example in question with border declared on body.

Tantek and Ian propose to replace the last paragraph of 9.2.1 with:
|
| Properties set on elements that cause anonymous block boxes to be
| generated still apply to the boxes and content of that element. For
| example, if a border had been set on the BODY element in the above
| example, the border would be drawn around C1 (open at the end of the
| line) and C2 (open at the start of the line).
|
| Some user agents have implemented borders on inlines containing
| blocks in other ways, e.g. by wrapping such nested blocks inside
| "anonymous line boxes" and thus drawing inline borders around such
| boxes. As CSS1 and CSS2 did not define this behavior, CSS1-only and
| CSS2-only user agents may implement this alternative model and still
| claim conformance to this part of CSS2.1. This does not apply to UAs
| developed after this specification was released.

Resolution: Text above accepted.

Issue 219. "block level elements" is sometimes used to mean
block+table and sometimes to mean block + table-cell

Tantek says:

Yes this could be a problem.

Essentially the distinction is outer-block-level-ness and
inner-block-level-ness, e.g.

 display      block-level-ness (if any)
 -------------------------------------
 block        inner and outer
 list-item    inner and outer
 table        outer
 table-cell   inner
 inline-block inner

I believe "block level elements" is used nearly always to mean "outer
block level" but there are probably some instances where it really
means "inner block level". Not sure how to resolve this.

Perhaps we should simply leave this as is and address specific
instances as we find them (e.g. if "block level element" is used in a
context where table vs. table-cell makes a difference, we can point
that out).

Notes from meeting: How to resolve this for table-cells and
   inline-blocks and table-captions: Imagine the same situation with
   an anonymous block box immediately inside the table cell containing
   all its children -- the rendering should be the same.

Resolution: Solve individual cases (see below) and rely on editors to
find further cases.

Resolution 1:
   For line-height, change "If the property is set on a block-level
   element whose content" to "If the property is set on a block-level,
   table-cell, table-caption or inline-block element whose content".

Resolution 2:
   For vertical-align, change "or to the strut of a parent block-level
   element." to "or to the strut of a parent block-level, table-cell,
   table-caption or inline-block element."

Resolution 3:
   :first-line pseudo-element should apply to block-level, table-cell,
   table-caption or inline-block.

Resolution 4:
   Definition of bidi-override, second sentence, reword to: For
   block-level, table-cell, table-caption, or inline-block elements
   this creates an override for inline-level descendents not within
   another block-level, table-cell, table-caption, or inline-block
   element.

Resolution 5:
   Editors to check their chapters for occurances of the term "block
   level" to ensure the above criteria are met.

Issue 225. Where does a float between two blocks go? The current text
contradicts itself (defines it as being at the bottom of the last line
box or the top of the (common) containing block, then says it is
undefined and should be positioned at a place between collapsed
margins). We could change rule 5 in section 9.5 to read:

5. The outer top of a floating box may not be higher than the outer
   top of any block or floated box generated by an element earlier in
   the source document<ins>, and may not be higher than the bottom padding
   edge of any earlier block-level sibling</ins>.

...or add a new rule after rule 5 to mention that, or we could move
the text after the rules to be before the rules, or be the first rule,
and change the text to read:

0. When the float occurs between two collapsing margins, the float is
   positioned as if it had an otherwise empty anonymous block parent
   taking part in the flow. The position of such a parent is defined
   by the rules in the section on margin collapsing. This block then
   becomes the containing block for the float in the rules below.

Note: This is technically editorial (We already agreed to the change,
we just got the wording too wooly. Our sheep would be proud.)

Resolution: Take the paragraph after the rules in section 9.5 Floats
("When the rules above do not result in an exact vertical position, as
may be the case when the float occurs between two collapsing margins,
the float is positioned as if it had an otherwise empty anonymous
block parent taking part in the flow. The position of such a parent is
defined by the rules in the section on margin collapsing.") and move
it to the end of rule 4, then edit the first bit of this text (up to
the second comma) to read "When the float occurs between two

Issue 226. Line boxes shrink to make room for floats... do we want to
say they make room for the outer edge of a float? If not, earlier
content can have to move out of the way of later floats, which is a
circular dependency. We appear to have lost the note saying that
behaviour for negative margins on floats is undefined. (It doesn't
need to be, the most sensible, IMHO, behavour is to define things per
the outer edge as we have for the rules.)

Tantek suggests: "negative margins for floats may not necessarily
display earlier content"

Ian says: I'd rather just say it shouldn't (i.e. "use the margin
box"). It seems much more predictable, a LOT easier to implement, and
actually more useful for authors who want to have that kind of effect.
For example, Eric's book has examples where he puts negative margins
on floats that would get broken if we let UAs wrap around the border
edge instead.

Tantek later agreed with Ian.

David and Bert also agree.

Resolution: Change "However, line boxes created next to the float are
shortened to make room for the floated box" to "However, line boxes
created next to the float are shortened to make room for the margin
box of the float". (adds "for the margin box of" remove trailing "ed
box".)

  certainly be reasonable for CSS3. "
Except that I *do* feel more strongly about not having these

Issue 233. http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227004
What is 'column width'; does it include cell padding, borders, border
spacing?

Tantek:
| Proposed resolution:
|   include cell padding: YES
|   include cell borders: NO
|   include border spacing: NO
|
| This is according to:
|
| http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#auto-table-layout
|
| "column width" appears to include cell padding, but NOT cell border nor
| border spacing.

Issue 234. http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45631

text-indent: % is relative to the containing block and not the width?!

    <div class="very narrow and text-indent set to 50%">

Issue 235.
Section 6.1.2, Computed values, needs to be slightly rewritten now
that we've changed the meaning of computed. I suggest replacing the
first two paragraphs with:

| Specified values are resolved to computed values during the cascade;
| for example valid relative URIs are made absolute and 'em' and 'ex'
| units are computed to pixel or absolute lengths. Computing a value
| never requires the user agent to render the document.
|
| The computed value of invalid and absolute URIs is the specified
| value.

Actual values (6.1.3, the next section) should be changed as well. In
fact we might want to add mention of Used values. I propose replacing
6.1.3 Actual values with:

| 6.1.3 Used values
|
| Computed values can be relative to each other; for example a width
| could be set as a percentage, which is dependent on the containing
| block's width. The <dfn id="usedValue">used value</dfn> is the
| result of taking the computed value and resolving these dependencies
| into a final absolute value used for the actual layout.
|
| 6.1.4 Actual values
|
| A used value is in principle the value used for rendering, but a
| user agent may not be able to make use of the value in a given
| environment. For example, a user agent may only be able to render
| borders with integer pixel widths and may therefore have to
| approximate the computed width, or the user agent may be forced to
| use only black and white shades instead of full colour. The actual
| value is the used value after any approximations have been applied.

Then in section 10.3 Calculating widths and margins replace the <dfn>
markup for the mention of "used value" with <a
href="cascade.html#usedValue">.

(Original resolution: Agreed with slightly different text. (assumed
editorial by Bert, David, Ian, Tantek))

Resolution: Make changes described above.

Resolution changed due to issue resolution conflict. See:

Issue 236.
emeyer writes:
| In CSS2.1, section 17.2.1 talks about inserting anonymous objects in

Currently the spec says margins of the root element collapse with its
children. Should it?
Opera pre-release builds say yes.
Previous Opera builds say no.
Mozilla and Safari pre-release builds say no.
WinIE6.1 preview release build says no.

Doing this breaks livejournal.com quite visibly.

Could be easily fixed (if we think "no") by adding another bullet
point to 8.3.1:

* Margins of the root element's box do not collapse.

| | 10.6.6 Block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow when

Issue 244. What does "generic notion of newline" mean wrt bidi?

Specifically, <br> is supposed to be equivalent to U+2028 LINE
SEPARATOR (HTML4 9.3.2.1), which is bidi class WS (whitespace
neutral), while U+000A is class B (paragraph separator).

But we say line breaks occur "where necessary" for automatic line
wrapping and "at occurances of \A" and "newlines in the source". We
also say that "\A is the generic concept of a newline" in CSS.

So how do you, in a pure CSS UA, implement the <br> element in CSS?

Are \A-style-newlines in generated content bidi class B? Presumably the
"needed" newlines are class WS?

Ref: http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Bidirectional_Character_Types

Tantek:
| I am not a bidi expert so I'm not sure how to evaluate this issue.
| How do bidi UAs implement <br> in terms of CSS?

Ian:
| Badly. IIRC, WinIE does it per CSS, Mozilla does it per HTML, and
| Opera does something stupid (treats it as a line break and LRO or
| something).

Second, change 5.9 "ID selectors" from "A CSS ID selector contains a
"#" immediately followed by the ID value." to "A CSS ID selector
contains a "#" immediately followed by the ID value, which must be an
identifier."

Third, change the following sentence in Appendix G:

Add a sentence to Appendix G prohibiting null bytes and \0 - \000000.  The

here, the computed values of the relevant 'margin-top' and
'margin-bottom' properties are set to '0'." but it should say "used
values" not "computed. (editorial)

Resolution: Agreed.

Proposed Issues

These are not CSS2.1 issues, they are issues pending WG approval.
Unless the WG actively agrees to address these, they aren't issues.
========================================================================
Issue 267. http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225811#c14

CSS2.1 says "A descendent box is positioned absolutely, partly outside
the box. Such boxes are not clipped by the overflow property on their
ancestors." (section 11.1) but also says " It affects the clipping of
all of the element's content except any descendant elements (and their
respective content and descendants) whose containing block is the
viewport or an ancestor of the element." (section 11.1.1)

I believe the first quote above should have the second sentence
changed to "Such boxes are not always clipped by the overflow property
on their ancestors." (addition of "always"), leaving the later section
to define it properly.

Resolution: Agreed.

Issue closed.

Issue 268. http://www.w3.org/mid/410-2200312014154837156@mindspring.com
Section 17.5, Visual layout of table contents: Typos at the end of the
XHTML example's 2nd and 3rd lines (invalid markup).

Resolution: Editorial agreed.

Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue P3. http://www.w3.org/mid/3FF6FF3C.3050004@mit.edu
There is a number of places in the spec where terms are used without
linking to the term definition.  For example the "Applies To" part of
hte "max-width" property says "all elements except non-replaced inline
elements and table elements".  None of this is linkified; the user is
left to guess what "table elements" are in this context.  These are
actually defined at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#internal but
that's not made clear anywhere in the spec apart from the Index.  I've
seen at least one WG member be confused as to the meaning of "table
element" in the CSS2.1 spec as a result....

It would be good to make both "table elements" and "non-replaced inline
elements" links in that text and in all similar texts in the spec.

Rejected.
Editors can fix if they see it.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue P4. fantasai has been quite vocal against our saying
'background-attachment: scroll' should't scroll when used with
'overflow: scroll'.
e.g.:
   http://www.w3.org/mid/3FF8C0E6.5050107@escape.com
...and related posts.

Rejected.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 271. http://www.w3.org/mid/40155B52.8040806@gmx.de

Can 'empty-cells' affect the width of an empty cell? e.g. if it has
borders when shown, are those borders taken into account when empty?

The spec is a little vague on this.

Testcase: http://people.freenet.de/bernd_mozilla/empty_w3c.html

Resolution: Spec is clear enough. No effect on layout.
Issue closed.

Issue 273. 5.11.3 The dynamic pseudo-classes: :hover, :active,
and :focus
| CSS 2.1 doesn't define if the parent of an element that is ':active'
| or ':hover is also in that state.
Missing quote after "':hover".
Resolution: Editor to fix.
Document updated.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 274. Fallout from computed/used issue in 4.3.2 Lengths

| Child elements do not inherit the relative values specified for
| their parent; they (generally) inherit the computed values.

Strike "(generally)".

| In cases where the computed length cannot be supported, user agents
| must approximate it in the actual value.

Change "computed" to "used" and linkify.

Resolution: Accepted.

Issue 276. 10.3.5 Floating, non-replaced elements
# Thirdly, find the available width: in this case, this is the width
# of the containing block minus 'margin-left' and 'margin-right'.

That should be "minus the used values of 'margin-left',
'border-left-width', 'padding-left', 'padding-right',
'border-right-width', 'margin-right', and the widths of any relevant
scroll bars".

Resolution: agreed.

Issue 277. 10.4 Minimum and maximum widths: 'min-width' and 'max-width'

If you have a 300x375 image, with 'height' and 'width' both set to
'auto', and:

   min-width: 75
   max-width: 150
   min-height: 0
   max-height: 75

...the current rules in section 10.4 end up saying that the dimensions
should be 150x75, which is much more skewed than it should be. The
better answer would be 75x75.

dbaron says:
|
| I propose the following two changes be made to both sections 10.3.2
| and 10.6.2, no matter what we decide for section 10.4, to clarify things
| that I noticed I had to implement that were defined poorly or not at
| all:
|
|   1. In sections 10.3.2 (PROP=width, OTHER=height) and 10.6.2
|      (PROP=height, OTHER=width), change the text:
|
|        If 'PROP' has a computed value of 'auto' and 'OTHER' also has a
|        computed value of 'auto', the element's intrinsic PROP is the
|        used value of 'PROP'.
|
|      to:
|
|        If 'PROP' has a computed value of 'auto' and 'OTHER' also has a
|        computed value of 'auto', the used value of 'PROP' is determined
|        by the <a href="the rules in section 10.4">as described in the
|        section on min-width</a>.
|
|   2. To the end of sections 10.3.2 and 10.6.2, add:
|
|      Note: The used OTHER is influenced by the computed values of
|      'min-OTHER' and 'max-OTHER'.
|
| Proposal (1) resolves a contradiction between 10.3.2/10.6.2 and 10.4
| (where we clearly want 10.4 to win), and proposal (2) clarifies the case
| where one is 'auto' and the other is not.

fantasai proposed the following table to replace the current list in
section 10.4:
   http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/specs/css2.1/min-max-replaced

dbaron implemented this and it passed the relevant tests.

Issue 282. need to update text at top of section 6.1.
It reads:

| The final value of a property is the result of a three-step
| calculation: the value is determined through specification (the
| "specified value"), then resolved into an absolute value if
| necessary (the "computed value"), and finally transformed according
| to the limitations of the local environment (the "actual value").

It should read:

| The final value of a property is the result of a four-step
| calculation: the value is determined through specification (the
| "specified value"), then resolved into a value that is used for
| inheritance (the computed value), then converted into an absolute
| value if necessary (the "used value"), and finally transformed
| according to the limitations of the local environment (the "actual

Issue 283. http://www.w3.org/mid/200402162226.i1GMQ0n01266@djwhome.demon.co.uk
C.2.18 says that aural style sheets have been moved to an
informative appendix.  I interpreted this to mean that they
had been deferred pending interoperable implementations,
so didn't look at Appendix A in detail.

However, A.1 says:
 1) that they are deprecated, which is much stronger than
    simply being deferred;
 2) says they are *defined* by the appendix, which seems very
    normative to me (this is an internal conflict in Appendix
    A as well as between Appendix A and Appendix C.

Resolution: Change appendix C to say appendix A is deprecated.
Issue closed.

Issue P18 [284]. http://www.w3.org/mid/16428.57705.189337.320274@lanalana.inria.fr

We decided that Fantasai was right and the example in 9.8.3, showing
'clear' on an inline element, was wrong. But we didn't remove the
example:

    Resolution: The example is indeed inaccurate, but we're going to
    leave it for now.

I'm not too happy with that. Can't we remove 9.8, or add some text to
it, that says the example is wrong?

Issue rejected.
Issue closed.
