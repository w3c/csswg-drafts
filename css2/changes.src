<P><em>This appendix is informative, not normative.</em></P>

<P>Below are the changes relative to the second revision of CSS2
(CSS&nbsp;2.2 [[CSS22]]). The changes between the first and the second
revisions are listed in the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/changes.html" >Changes section of
CSS 2.2</a> The changes between the original CSS2 specification (see
[[CSS2]]) and CSS&nbsp;2.1 (see [[CSS21]]) can be found in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/changes.html" >Changes section of
CSS&nbsp;2.1.</a>

<p>This chapter is not a complete list of changes. Minor editorial
changes and most changes to examples are not listed here.

<ul>

      <li id=s.10.8.1 class=change>
        <p>In <a href="visudet.html#leading" >“10.8.1 Leading and
	    half-leading”</a>, replace the last paragraph as follows:

	<blockquote>
	  <p><del>The baseline of an 'inline-block' is the baseline of
	      its last line box in the normal flow, unless it has
	      either no in-flow line boxes or if its 'overflow'
	      property has a computed value other than 'visible', in
	      which case the baseline is the bottom margin edge.</del>

	  <p><ins>The baseline of an 'inline-block’ whose ‘overflow’
	      property has a computed value of ‘visible’ is the
	      baseline of its last line box in the normal flow, unless
	      it has no in-flow line boxes, in which case the baseline
	      is the bottom margin edge. The baseline of an
	      inline-block whose ‘overflow’ property has a computed
	      value not equal to ‘visible’ is the higher of either its
	      bottom margin edge or the baseline of its last line box
	      in the normal flow, unless it has no in-flow line boxes,
	      in which case its baseline is the baseline is the bottom
	      border edge.</ins>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This avoids an undesirable visual difference between
	  'overflow: visible' and 'overflow: auto', in particular in
	  the case when there is no visible scrolling mechanism,
	  beause the height is sufficient.
