<h1 align="center">
<a name="generated-text">Generated</a> <span class="index-def"
title="generated content">content</span> and automatic <span
class="index-def" title="automatic numbering">numbering</span></h1>

<p>In some cases, authors may want user agents to render content
that does not come from the <a href="conform.html#doctree">document
tree</a>. One familiar example of this is a numbered list; the author
does not want to list the numbers explicitly, he or she wants the
user agent to generate them automatically. Similarly, authors
may want the user agent to insert the word
"Figure" before the caption of a figure, or "Chapter 7" before the
seventh chapter title. For audio or braille in particular, user agents
should be able to insert these strings.

<p>In CSS2, content may be generated by several mechanisms:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <span class="propinst-content">'content'</span>
property, in conjunction with the :before and :after pseudo-elements.
<li>The <span class="propinst-cue-before">'cue-before'</span>,
<span class="propinst-cue-after">'cue-after'</span>,
<span class="propinst-pause-before">'pause-before'</span>,
and <span class="propinst-pause-after">'pause-after'</span>
aural properties. When the aural properties
are specified as well as the the <span
class="propinst-content">'content'</span> property, content
is rendered in the following order: :before, <span
class="propinst-cue-before">'cue-before'</span>, <span
class="propinst-pause-before">'pause-before'</span>, the element's
content, <span class="propinst-pause-after">'pause-after'</span>,
<span class="propinst-cue-after">'cue-after'</span>, and :after.
<li>Elements with a value of 'list-item'
for the <span class="propinst-display">'display'</span> property.
<!--<li>The <span class="propinst-marks">'marks'</span> property.-->
</ul>

<P>Below we describe the mechanisms associated with the <span
class="propinst-content">'content'</span> property.

<h2><a name="before-after-content">The</a> <span class="index-def"
title=":before|pseudo-elements:::before|before">:before</span> and <span
class="index-def" title=":after|pseudo-elements:::after|after">:after</span>
pseudo-elements</h2>

<p>Authors specify the style and location of generated content with
the :before and :after pseudo-elements. The <span
class="propinst-content">'content'</span> property, in conjunction
with these pseudo-elements, specifies what is inserted. The :before
and :after pseudo-elements <a
href="cascade.html#inheritance">inherit</a> any inheritable properties
from the element to which they are attached.</p>

<p>As their names indicate, the :before and :after pseudo-elements
specify content, and the style of that content, before and after an
element's <a href="conform.html#doctree">document tree</a> content.

<P>The :before and :after pseudo-elements elements allow 
values of the <span class="propinst-display">'display'</span>
property as follows:

<ul>
<li>If the <a href="selector.html#subject">subject</a> of the 
selector is a block-level element, allowed values are
'none', 'inline', 'block', and 'marker'. 
If the value of the <span class="propinst-display">'display'</span>
has any other value, the pseudo-element will behave as if the value
was 'block'.
<li>If the <a href="selector.html#subject">subject</a> of the 
selector is an inline-level element, allowed values are
'none' and 'inline'.
If the value of the <span class="propinst-display">'display'</span>
has any other value, the pseudo-element will behave as if the value
was 'inline'.
</ul>

<div class="note"><P>
<em><strong>Note.</strong> Other values may be permitted in
future levels of CSS.</em>
</div>


<!-- Proposed -IJ --> 

<P>User agents must ignore the following properties with :before and
:after pseudo-elements: <span
class="propinst-position">'position'</span>, <span
class="propinst-float">'float'</span>, list properties, and table
properties.

<P>The (inline or block) box created for the generated content
precedes (or follows for :after) any box generated by the element's
content. For block-level elements, the containing block established by
the element expands to include any :before or :after content.

<div class=example>
<p>For example, the following rule inserts a double quote mark 
before and after every Q element. The color of the quote will be red, but the
font will be the same as the font of the rest of the Q element:</p>

<pre>
Q:before, Q:after {
    content: "\"";
    color: red
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>In a :before or :after pseudo-element declaration, non-inherited
properties take their <a href="cascade.html#initial-value">initial
value</a>.</p>

<div class=example>
<p>Because the initial value of the <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> property is 'inline', the
quote in the previous example is inserted as an inline box (i.e.,
on the same line as the element's initial text content).
The next example explicitly sets the 
<span class="propinst-display">'display'</span> property to
'block', so that the inserted text becomes a block:</p>

<pre>
BODY:after {
    content: "The End";
    display: block;
    margin-top: 2em;
    text-align: center;
}
</pre>

<P>Note that an audio user agent would speak the words "The End" after
rendering the rest of the BODY content.
</div>

<!-- Where is the list bullet on LI:before? It will be before the
generated text, even if that is a block, because the :before is a
child of the elt. Give example showing that border on elt goes around
generated content as well.

<h2><a name="content">The</a> <span
class="propinst-content">'content'</span> property</h2>

<!-- #include src=properties/content.srb -->

<p>The value of the <span class="propinst-content">'content'</span>
property is a sequence of strings, URIs, and counters. The <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> property controls whether
the content is placed in an inline or block box.

<P>The values have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="index-inst" title="&lt;string&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-string"><strong>&lt;string&gt;</strong></span></span>
<dd>Text content. 

<dt><span class="index-inst" title="&lt;uri&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-uri"><strong>&lt;uri&gt;</strong></span></span>
<dd>The value is a URI that designates an external resource.
If a user agent cannot support the resource because of the
media types it supports, it must ignore the resource.
<strong>Note.</strong> CSS2 offers no
mechanism to change the size of the embedded object, or to provide a
textual description, like the "alt" or "longdesc" attributes do for
images in HTML. This may change in future levels of CSS.

<dt><span class="index-inst" title="&lt;counter&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-counter"><strong>&lt;counter&gt;</strong></span></span>
<dd><a href="syndata.html#counter">Counters</a> have the form
'counter(<var>name</var>)' or 'counter(<var>name</var>,
<var>style</var>)'. The generated text is the value of the named
counter at this point in the rendering structure, in the indicated
style ('decimal' by default).

<dt><span class="index-inst" title="open-quote"><span
class="value-inst-open-quote"><strong>open-quote</strong></span></span> and 
<span class="index-inst" title="close-quote"><span
class="value-inst-close-quote">'close-quote'</span></span>

<dd>Both of these values are replaced by the appropriate string
from the <span class="propinst-quotes"><strong>'quotes'</strong></span> property.

<dt><span class="index-inst" title="no-open-quote"><span
class="value-inst-no-open-quote"><strong>no-open-quote</strong></span></span>

<dd>Inserts nothing (the empty string), but increments the level of
nesting for quotes.

<dt><span class="index-inst" title="no-close-quote"><span
class="value-inst-no-close-quote"><strong>no-close-quote</strong></span></span>

<dd>Inserts nothing (the empty string), but decrements the level of
nesting for quotes.

<dt><span class="index-def" title="attr()">attr(X)</span>
<dd>It is also possible to insert the value of an 
attribute by using the
'attr()' function, which returns the value of attribute X. If
the current element doesn't have an attribute X, an empty string is
returned. 

<P>If two or more attributes named 'X' appear in a selector,
the value of the rightmost attribute is the one inserted
by 'attr(X)'.

<p>The case-sensitivity of attribute names depends on the
document language.

<p class="note">[Should the name of the attribute be quoted? BB]

<!--
<p>Note that the string is parsed according to the rules of the
document language, not CSS, which means that numerical escapes like
"&amp;#32;" and "&amp;#65;" are interpreted (they are replaced by a
space and an "A", resp.), but that backslashes are not special ("\20"
is <em>not</em> replaced by a space).
-->
</dl>

<div class="example">
<p>This rule inserts the text of the HTML "alt" attribute before the
image. If the image is not displayed, the reader will still see the
"alt" text.

<pre>
IMG:before {content: attr(alt)}
</pre>
</div>

<P>Authors should put <span class="propinst-content">'content'</span>
declarations in <span class="index-inst" title="@media"><a
href="media.html@at-media-rule">@media</a></span> rules when
the content requires media consideration. For instance, literal
text may be used for any media group, but images only
apply to the visual, bitmap media groups, and sound files only
apply to the aural media group.

<div class=note>
<p><em><strong>Note.</strong> In future levels of CSS, the <span
class="propinst-content">'content'</span> property may accept
additional values, allowing it to vary the style of pieces 
of the generated
content, but in CSS2, the content of the :before or :after
pseudo-element all has the same style.
</em></p>
</div>

<p>Authors may include newlines in the generated content by writing
the "\A" escape sequence in one of the strings after the <span
class="propinst-content">'content'</span> property. This inserts a
forced line break, similar to the BR element in HTML. See <a
href="syndata.html#strings">"Strings"</a> and <a
href="syndata.html#escaped-characters">"Characters and case"</a> for
more information on the "\A" escape sequence.

<div class="example"><P>
Example:

<PRE>
H1:before {
    display: block;
    text-align: center;
    content: "chapter\A hoofdstuk\A chapitre"
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="note"><P>
<em><strong>Note.</strong>
Generated content does not alter the document tree.  In particular, it
is not fed back to the document language processor (e.g., for
reparsing).

</div>

<h2><a name="compact-run-in-gen">Interaction</a> of :before and :after
with <span class="index-inst" title="compact"><span
class="value-inst-compact">'compact'</span></span> and <span
class="index-inst" title="run-in"><span
class="value-inst-run-in">'run-in'</span></span> elements</h2>

<p>The following cases can occur:

<ol>
<li><strong>A 'run-in' or 'compact' element has a :before
pseudo-element of type 'inline':</strong> the pseudo-element is taken
into account when the size of the element is computed (for 'compact')
and is rendered inside the same block box as the element.

<li><strong>A 'run-in' or 'compact' element has an :after
pseudo-element of type 'inline':</strong> ditto.

<li><strong>A 'run-in' or 'compact' element has a :before
pseudo-element of type 'block':</strong> the pseudo-element is
rendered as a block above the element, and does not take part in the
computation of the element's size (for 'compact').

<li><strong>A 'run-in' or 'compact' element has an :after
pseudo-element of type 'block':</strong> both the element and its
:after pseudo-element are rendered as block boxes. The element
is <em>not</em> rendered as an inline box in its own :after
pseudo-element. [?? This could also be defined the other way round,
but this seems easier to understand.]

<!-- Make sure to handle ?? above -IJ -->

<li><strong>The element following a 'run-in' or 'compact' element has
a :before of type 'block':</strong> the decision how to render the
'run-in'/'compact' element is made with respect to the block box
resulting from the :before pseudo-element.

<li><strong>The element following a 'run-in' or 'compact' element has
an :before of type 'inline':</strong> the decision how to render the
'run-in'/'compact' element depends on the type of the element to which
the :before is attached.

</ol>

<div class="example">
<p>Here is an example of a 'run-in' header with an :after 
pseudo-element, followed by a paragraph with a :before pseudo-element. All
pseudo-elements are inline (the default) in this example. When the
style sheet:</p>

<pre>
H3 {display: run-in}
H3:after {content: ": "}
P:before {content: "... "}
</pre>

<p>is applied to this source document:</p>

<pre class="html-example">
&lt;H3&gt;Centaurs&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;have hoofs
&lt;P&gt;have a tail
</pre>

<p>The visual rendering will resemble:</p>

<pre class="none">
Centaurs: ... have hoofs
... have a tail
</pre>
</div>

<h2><a name="quotes">Quotation marks</a></h2>

<!-- #include src=properties/quotes.srb -->

<P>So that user agents may handle nested quotation marks in a
language-dependent way, CSS provides the <span
class="propinst-quotes">'quotes'</span> property. Values have
the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>none</strong>
<dd>The 'open-quote' and 'close-quote' values of the
<span class="propinst-content">'content'</span> property
produce no quotations marks.
<dt>[<span class="index-inst" title="&lt;string&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-string"><strong>&lt;string&gt;</strong></span></span>
&nbsp;<span class="index-inst" title="&lt;string&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-string"><strong>&lt;string&gt;</strong></span></span>]+
<dd>Values for the 'open-quote' and 'close-quote' values of the
<span class="propinst-content">'content'</span> property are taken
from this list of pairs of quotation marks (opening and
closing). The first (leftmost) pair represents the outermost level of
quotation, the second pair the first level of embedding, etc. The user
agent must apply the appropriate pair of quotation marks according to
the level of embedding.
</dl>

<P>Applying the following style sheet:</p>

<PRE class="example">
  [LANG|="en"] { quoting: ´"´ ´"´ "´" "´" ´"´ ´"´ }
  [LANG|="fr"] { quoting: "« " " »" ´"´ ´"´ "´" "´"  }
  [LANG|="no"] { quoting: "«" "»" "'" "'" "\"" "\""  }
<!--  [LANG|="se"] { quoting: "»" "«"  ´"´ ´"´ "´" "´"  }-->
</PRE>

<P>to the following HTML fragment:</p>

<PRE class="html-example">
&lt;BODY lang="en"&gt;
   &lt;P&gt;&lt;Q&gt;Quote me!&lt;/Q&gt;
   &lt;P LANG="no"&gt;&lt;Q&gt;Siter &lt;Q&gt;meg&lt;/Q&gt;!&lt;/Q&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
</PRE>

<P>would allow a user agent to render:</p>

<PRE>
  "Quote me!"

  «Siter 'meg'!»
</PRE>

<p>Authors may insert quotation marks in generated text with the <span
class="index-def" title="open-quote"><a class="value-def"
name="value-def-open-quote">'open-quote'</a></span> and <span
class="index-def" title="close-quote"><a class="value-def"
name="value-def-close-quote">'close-quote'</a></span> values of the
<span class="propinst-content">'content'</span> property. Each
occurrence of 'open-quote' or 'close-quote' is replaced by one of the
strings from the value of <span
class="propinst-quotes">'quotes'</span>, based on the depth of
nesting.

<p>'Open-quote' refers to the first of a pair of quotes, 'close-quote'
refers to the second. Which pair of quotes is used depend on the
nesting level of quotes: the number of occurrences of 'open-quote' in
all generated text before the current occurrence, minus the number of
occurrences of 'close-quote'. If the depth is 0, the first pair is
used, if the depth is 1, the second pair is used, etc. If the depth is
greater than the number of pairs, the last pair is repeated.

<p>Note that this quoting depth is independent of the nesting
of the source document or the rendering structure.

<p>Some typographic styles require open quotation marks to be repeated
before every paragraph of a quote spanning several paragraphs, but
only the last paragraph ends with a closing quotation mark. In CSS,
this can be achieved by inserting "phantom" closing quotes. The
keyword <span class="index-def" title="no-close-quote"><a
class="value-def"
name="value-def-no-close-quote">'no-close-quote'</a></span> decrements
the quoting level, but does not insert a quotation mark.

<div class="example">
<p>The following style sheet puts opening quotation marks on every
paragraph in a BLOCKQUOTE, and inserts a single closing quote at the
end:

<pre>
BLOCKQUOTE P:before {content: open-quote}
BLOCKQUOTE P:after {content: no-close-quote}
BLOCKQUOTE P.last:after {content: close-quote}
</pre>

<p>This relies on the last paragraph being marked with a class "last",
since there are no selectors that can match the last child of an
element.
</div>

<p>For symmetry, there is also a <span class="index-def"
title="no-open-quote"><a class="value-def"
name="value-def-no-open-quote">'no-open-quote'</a></span> keyword,
which inserts nothing, but increments the quotation depth by one.


<h2>Automatic <span class="index-def" title="counters"><a name="counters">counters</a></span>
and numbering</h2>

<p>Automatic numbering in CSS2 is controlled with two properties,
<span class="propinst-counter-increment">'counter-increment'</span>
and <span class="propinst-counter-reset">'counter-reset'</span>. The
counters defined by these properties can be used to generate text for
the <span class="propinst-content">'content'</span> property (see
above).

<!-- #include src=properties/counter-reset.srb -->
<!-- #include src=properties/counter-increment.srb -->

<p>The <span
class="propinst-counter-increment">'counter-increment'</span> property
accepts one or more names of counters (identifiers), each one
optionally followed by a number. The number indicates by how much the
counter is incremented for every occurrence of the element. The
default increment is 1. Zero and negative numbers are allowed.

<p>The <span class="propinst-counter-reset">'counter-reset'</span>
property also contains a list of one or more names of counters, each
one optionally followed by a number. The number gives the value that
the counter is set to on each occurrence of the element. The default
is 0.

<p>If <span
class="propinst-counter-increment">'counter-increment'</span> refers
to a counter that is not in the <a href="#scope">scope</a> of any
<span class="propinst-counter-reset">'counter-reset'</span>, the
counter is assumed to have been reset to 0 by the root element.

<div class="example">
<p>This example shows a way to number chapters and sections with
"Chapter 1", "1.1", "1.2", etc.

<pre>
H1:before {
    content: "Chapter " counter(chapter) ". "
    counter-increment: chapter;  /* Add 1 to chapter */
    counter-reset: section;      /* Set section to 0 */
}
H2:before {
    content: counter(chapter) "." counter(section) " "
    counter-increment: section
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>If an element increments/resets a counter and also uses it (in the
'content' property of its :before or :after pseudo-element), the
counter is used <em>after</em> being incremented/reset.

<p>If an element both resets and increments a counter, the counter is
reset first and then incremented.

<P>The <span class="propinst-counter-reset">'counter-reset'</span>
property follows the cascading rules. Thus, due to cascading, the
following stylesheet:</p>

<pre class="example">
H1 {counter-reset: section -1}
H1 {counter-reset: imagenum 99}
</pre>

<p>will only reset 'imagenum'. To reset both counters, they have to be
specified together: 'counter-reset: section -1 imagenum 99'.</P>

<h3><a name="scope">Nested counters and scope</a></h3>

<p>Counters are "self-nesting", in the sense that re-using a counter
in a child element automatically creates a new instance of the
counter. This is important for situations like lists in HTML, where
elements can be nested inside themselves to arbitrary depth. It would
be impossible to define uniquely named counters for each level.

<div class="example">
<p>Thus the following suffices to number nested list items. The
result is very similar to that of setting 'display:list-item' and
'list-style: inside' on LI:

<pre>
OL {counter-reset: item}
LI {display: block}
LI:before {content: counter(item) ". "; counter-increment: item}
</pre>
</div>

<p>The self-nesting is based on the principle that every element that
has a 'counter-reset' for a counter X, creates a fresh counter X, the
<span class="index-def" title="scope"><dfn>scope</dfn></span> of which
is the element, its younger siblings, and all the descendants of the
element and its younger siblings.

<p>In the example above, an OL will create a counter, and all children
of the OL will refer to that counter.

<div class="html-example"> <p>If we denote by item[n] the
n<sup>th</sup> counter, and by "(" and ")" the beginning and end of a
scope, then the following HTML fragment will use the indicated
counters. (We assume the style sheet as given in the example above).

<pre>
&lt;OL&gt;               &lt;!-- (set item[0] to 0          --&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;item         &lt;!--  increment item[0] (= 1)   --&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;item         &lt;!--  increment item[0] (= 2)   --&gt;
    &lt;OL&gt;           &lt;!--  (set item[1] to 0         --&gt;
      &lt;LI&gt;item     &lt;!--   increment item[1] (= 1)  --&gt;
      &lt;LI&gt;item     &lt;!--   increment item[1] (= 2)  --&gt;
      &lt;LI&gt;item     &lt;!--   increment item[1] (= 3)  --&gt;
        &lt;OL&gt;       &lt;!--   (set item[2] to 0        --&gt;
          &lt;LI&gt;item &lt;!--    increment item[2] (= 1) --&gt;
        &lt;/OL&gt;      &lt;!--   )
        &lt;OL&gt;       &lt;!--   (set item[3] to 0        --&gt;
          &lt;LI&gt;     &lt;!--    increment item[3] (= 1) --&gt;
        &lt;/OL&gt;      &lt;!--   )                        --&gt;
      &lt;LI&gt;item     &lt;!--   increment item[1] (= 4)  --&gt;
    &lt;/OL&gt;          &lt;!--  )                         --&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;item         &lt;!--  increment item[0] (= 3)   --&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;item         &lt;!--  increment item[0] (= 4)   --&gt;
&lt;/OL&gt;              &lt;!-- )                          --&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;               &lt;!-- (reset item[4] to 0        --&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;item         &lt;!--  increment item[4] (= 1)   --&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;item         &lt;!--  increment item[4] (= 2)   --&gt;
&lt;/OL&gt;              &lt;!-- )                          --&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>To create numbers like "1", "1.1", "1.1.1", etc., the notation
<span class="index-def" title="counters">'counters</span>(X,
&lt;string&gt;)', or 'counters(X, &lt;string&gt;,
&lt;list-item-style&gt;)' can be used. This results in a string with
all counters separated by the given string. Example: 'counters(item,
".")'


<h3>Counter styles</h3>

<p>By default, counters are rendered with decimal numbers, but all the
styles available for <span
class="propinst-list-style-type">'list-style-type'</span> are also
available for counters. The notation is

<pre>
counter(<var>counter</var>)
</pre>
<p>for the default, decimal style, or

<pre>
counter(<var>counter</var>, <span class="propinst-list-style-type">'list-style-type'</span>)
</pre>

<p>All the styles are allowed, including 'disc', 'circle', 'square'
and 'none'.

<div class="example">
<p>Examples:

<pre>
H1:before { content: counter(chno, upper-latin) ". " }
H2:before { content: counter(section, upper-roman) " - " }
BLOCKQUOTE:after { content: " [" counter(bq, hebrew) "]" }
DIV.note:before { content: counter(notecntr, disc) " " }
P:before { content: counter(p, none) }
</pre>
</div>


<h3>Counters in elements with 'display: none'</h3>

<p>An element that is not displayed (<span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> set to 'none') cannot
increment or reset a counter.

<div class="example">
<p>For example, with the following style sheet,
H2s with class "secret" do not increment 'count2'.

<pre>
H2.secret {counter-increment: count2; display: none}
</pre>
</div>

<p>Elements with <span class="propinst-visibility">'visibility'</span>
set to 'hidden', on the other hand, <em>do</em> increment counters.

<h2><a name="markers">Markers</a></h2>

<P>There are very few situations in CSS2 where an element causes the
generation of more than one box. The most common case occurs for
elements with 'display: list-item' (see the section on <a
href="lists.html">lists</a>). The two generated boxes are the
principal box (the list item content) and the list item marker (to the
side of the principal box). Authors have very limited control of the
style or position of the list item marker through the <a
href="lists.html#list-props">list style properties.</a> 

<P>Markers are used in conjunction with the :before and :after
pseudo-elements to offer similar functionality, but give authors more
control over the position of the generated content.  Markers may be
used in conjunction with automatic counters to create a wider variety
of list styles than available with the list properties. They may also
be used to create numbered margin notes, etc.</p>

<P>An element may generate two marker boxes: one for :before content
and one for :after content, in addition to one principal box (that of
the element itself).  Marker boxes must only contain one line of
content (i.e., one <a href="visuren.html#line-box">line box</a>), so
they are not as flexible as <a href="visuren.html">floats</a>, which
may be used to align entire blocks horizontally.

<P>Marker boxes have padding and borders, but no margins.

<P>To create a marker box for :before or :after content, the <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> property must be given the
value 'marker'. The marker box is only created if the <span
class="propinst-content">'content'</span> property for the
pseudo-element actually generates content. The content will be
formatted as a single line. 

<P>For the :before pseudo-element, the baseline of text in the marker
box will be vertically aligned with the baseline of text in the first
line of content in the principal box. If the principal box contains no
text, the top outer edge of the marker box will be aligned with the
top outer edge of the principal box. For the :after pseudo-element,
the baseline of text in the marker box will be vertically aligned with
the baseline of text in the last line of content in the principal box.
If the principal box contains no text, the bottom outer edge of the
marker box will be aligned with the bottom outer edge of the
principal box.

<P>The vertical alignment of content within the marker box may be
specified with the <span
class="propinst-vertical-align">'vertical-align'</span> property.

<p>By default, the height of the :before marker and of the first line
box of the principal box is computed as if they were a single line
box. Analogously for the :after marker and the last line box. However,
the <span class="propinst-height">'height'</span> property may be
specified for a marker box.

<P>The width of a marker box defaults to the natural width of its
content, but may be specified with the <span
class="propinst-width">'width'</span> property. If the width of a
marker box's content is greater than the specified width, the <span
class="propinst-overflow">'overflow'</span> property specifies
overflow behavior. Marker boxes may overlap principal boxes.

<p>If the <span class="propinst-width">'width'</span> is not 'auto',
and is larger than the natural width, the <span
class="propinst-text-align">'text-align'</span> property determines
the alignment of the text in the marker box.

<P>The <span class="propinst-marker-offset">'marker-offset'</span>
property specifies the horizontal offset between a marker box and the
associated principal box. The distance is measured between their <a
href="visuren.html#border-edge">border edges</a>.

<p class="note">[Is this offset kept constant, even if
'overflow:visible'? I would say it gets smaller. BB]

<P>When the <span class="propinst-display">'display'</span> property
has the value 'marker' for content generated by an element with
'display: list-item', a marker box generated for ':before' replaces
the normal list item marker.
