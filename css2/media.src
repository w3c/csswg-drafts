<BODY>
<H1 align="center">Media types</H1>

The following sections describe the various media that may be the
target of presentation through CSS2.


<!-- What is the definitive list of media types? -->
<H2>Media Dependent Style Sheets</H2>

<P>Different output media can often take advantage of the same
properties. For example, the <span
class="propinst-font-size">'font-size'</span> property is useful both
for SCREEN and PRINT media. However, the two media types are different
enough to require different values on the common property; a document
will typically need a larger font on a computer screen than on paper.
For this reason, it's necessary to express that a style sheet -- or a
section of a style sheet -- applies to certain media types.

<P>There are two ways to do this:

<UL>

<LI>Specify the target medium from a style sheet with the <span
	    class="index-def" title="@media">@media</span> at-rule.

<div class="example"><P>
<PRE>
  @media print {
    /* style sheet "foo" goes here */
  }
</PRE>
</div>

<LI>Specify the target medium within the object language. For example,
in <a rel="biblioentry" href="./refs.html#ref-HTML40">[HTML40]</a>,
the "media" attribute on the LINK element specifies the target medium
of an external style sheet.

<div class="example"><P>

<PRE>
  &lt;LINK rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" 
           media="print" href="foo.css"&gt;
</PRE>
</div>

<P>Please consult the <a rel="biblioentry"
	  href="./refs.html#ref-HTML40">[HTML40]</a> specification for
	information about specifying alternate style sheets according
	to different media types.
</UL>

<P>Due to the same media type value, the two examples above are semantically
equivalent.

<p>The <span class="index-inst" title="@media">@media</span>construct
also allows style sheet rules for various media in the same style
sheet:

<pre>
  @media print {
    BODY { font-size: 10pt }
  }
  @media screen {
    BODY { font-size: 12pt }
  }
  @media screen, print {
    BODY { line-height: 1.2 }
  }
</pre>

<p>Any valid MEDIA attribute value is valid on @media.


<H2><a name="the-canvas">The canvas</a></H2>

<!-- Hakon: introduce notion of "viewport"? -->
<P> The <span class="index-def" title="canvas"><em>canvas</em></span>
is the part of the UA's drawing surface onto which
documents are rendered. No structural element of a document
corresponds to the canvas, and this raises two issues when formatting
a document:

<UL>
<LI> from where should the dimensions of the canvas be set?
<LI> when the document doesn't cover the whole canvas, how should this
     area be rendered?
</UL>

<P> A reasonable answer to the first question is that the initial size
of the canvas is based on the window size, but CSS2 leaves this issue
for the UA to decide. It is also reasonable to expect the UA to change
the canvas size when the window is resized, but this is also outside
the scope of CSS2.

<H3>The HTML canvas</H3>
<P> HTML extensions have set a precedent for the second question:
attributes on the BODY element set the background of the whole
canvas. To support designers' expectations, CSS2 introduces a special
rule to find the canvas background:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    If the <span class="propinst-background">'background'</span> value of the
    HTML element is different from 'transparent' then use it, else use
    the <span class="propinst-background">'background'</span> value of the BODY
    element. If the resulting value is 'transparent', the rendering is
    undefined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> This rule allows the following, for example:

<div class="example"><P>
<PRE>
  &lt;HTML style="background: url(http://style.com/marble.png)"&gt;
  &lt;BODY style="background: red"&gt;
</PRE>

<P> In the example above, the canvas will be covered with
"marble". The background of the BODY element (which may or may not
fully cover the canvas) will be red.
</div>


<P> Until other means of addressing the canvas become available, it is
recommended that canvas properties are set on the BODY element.

<H2><a name="the-page">The page: printing with CSS</a></H2>

CSS2 introduces a set of mechanisms for improved support of printing
from the Web. These extensions let style sheets express page breaks,
page boxes, and media dependencies. 

<H3>Background to printing</H3>

<P>No one has yet invented a cheaper, more reliable, more portable,
more convenient, or more universally acceptable &quot;reader&quot; of
information than the printed page. Modern printers are getting much
cheaper while overall quality is rising dramatically, especially in
desktop color printers.

<P>The screen is a very different type of output medium from paper.
It is unreasonable to expect information formatted for one medium to
look optimal on the other medium. Screens are smaller, more dynamic,
and more difficult to read. They may be multimedia and even
interactive. Paper is more dense, slower, and completely static. Print
resolution is usually much higher than screen resolution. As just one
example, it has been shown that sans serif fonts are easier to read on
screen, while fonts with serifs are easier to read on paper. 

<P>One aspect of the Web involves competition and it is very
important for Web publishers to not only attract a readers attention,
but to keep them interested and get them to return. Web pages must not
only be functional, but interesting, esthetically appealing, and eye
catching. Consequently, the best Web pages are very active, involving
many forms of multimedia. 

<P>On the other hand, printed pages are completely static by nature.
While they may contain both text, graphics, and images, they may not
contain video, animation, or sound. 

<P>The best web pages for screen display make the worst web pages for
print<i>. Therefore, the most active web pages must be converted to
static pages prior to printing.</i> If this is not done just right,
the intent of the author may be distorted and critical information may
be lost. If the information is not too significant, then perhaps this
can be done automatically by the user agent. 

<P>Where the best output for both media is a necessity, the author
must provide two versions of the content: an active version for screen
display and a separate static version for printing. While this is
definitely more work, many publishers on the Web are willing to go to
whatever lengths are necessary to attract and keep customers. Perhaps
future authoring tools will allow for the simultaneous production of
both pages. In any case, a simple and convenient method for the user
to find the print version is mandatory. 

<P>Printing by itself and multimedia by itself are two difficult and
highly developed disciplines already. The intersection of these two
features does not lend itself to a single, universal solution. Rather
a range of solutions is required to meet the various needs of many
types of Web publishers. 

<H3>The page model</H3>

<P>In the previous section, we defined the term <span
class="index-inst" title="canvas">"canvas"</span> as a surface with a
fixed width but infinitely long. In order to cope with printing, we
introduce the notion of the <span class="index-def"
title="page"><em>page</em></span>, which is a rectangular surface
(i.e., fixed width and fixed height. The following sections describe
mechanisms that authors may use to tell user agents how to alter the
<a href="./flowobj.html">visual flow model</a> so that elements are
correctly positioned on individual pages.

<P>Note that a "page" is an abstract rectangle that may or may not
correspond to the size of a physical "sheet" of paper. Once a page has
been formatted, it is the user agent's responsibility to transfer
pages to paper. The transfer may vary in complexity. Some transfer
possibilities include:

<ul>
<li>One page to one sheet of paper.
<li>Two pages to one sheet of paper (double-sided printing).
<li>N (small) pages to one sheet of paper.
<li>One (large) page to N sheets of paper (called <span
	    class="index-def" title="n-up"><em>n-up</em></span>
	  printing). 
<li>Signatures (a group of pages
printed on a sheet, which when folded and trimmed will appear in their
proper sequence).
<li>Printing to alternate paper trays.
<li>Printing to a file.
</ul>

<P>The transfer mechanism from page to sheet lies beyond the scope of
this specification. However, the user agent does need to target
a certain size and orientation when printing, and this is known as the
<span class="index-def" title="print target"><EM>print
target</EM></span>. The user will typically set set the target size
and orientation in the <EM>Print</EM> dialogue box of the UA. There
will often, but not always, be a correlation between the target size
and the sheet size. 

<H3>Page breaks</H3>

<P>Two new properties indicate where the UA should break pages, and on
what page (left or right) the subsequent content should resume.  These
new properties have been designed to support the <span
class="index-def" title="print medium|medium, print">PRINT</span>
medium, but can also be applied to other paged media, for example
<span class="index-def" title="projector medium|medium,
projector">PROJECTOR</span> medium.

<P>Page breaks may only occur between lines as formatted on 
<a href="#the-canvas">the canvas</a>.

<P>The <span
class="propinst-page-break-before">'page-break-before'</span> and
<span class="propinst-page-break-after">'page-break-after'</span>
properties cause page breaks to occur. A mechanism to suppress page
breaks is under discussion, but the syntax is not yet defined.


<DIV class="propdef">
<H4 class=propname>
    <a name="propdef-page-break-before">
       <span class="index-def" title="'page-break-before', definition of">
       'page-break-before'</span></a></H4>
<TABLE class="propinfo"><TR><TH align="right">Property name:<TD>page-break-before</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Value:<TD>auto | always | left | right</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Initial:<TD>auto</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Applies to:<TD>block level and inline elements
	      except those within tables</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Inherited:<TD>no</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Percentage values:<TD>N/A</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>


<P>The values mean the following:

<dl>
<dt>auto</dt>
<dd>do a page break before the element only if necessary <SPAN CLASS=change>(e.g. if
there is no remaining space on the current page)</SPAN></dd>
<dt>always</dt>
<dd>always do a page break before the element </dd>
<dt>left</dt>
<dd>do one or two page breaks before the element until a blank left page is reached </dd>
<dt>right</dt>
<dd>do one or two page breaks before the element until a blank right page is reached </dd>
</dl>

<p>If there are conflicts between this property and the <span
class="propinst-page-break-after">'page-break-after'</span> value on
the next element (as formatted on the canvas), the value that results
in the largest number of page breaks will be used.

<div class="example"><P>
<p>For example, a page break may be inserted in the document before
all H1 elements:

<pre>
  &lt;STYLE&gt;
    H1 { page-break-before: always }
  &lt;/STYLE&gt;
  ...
  &lt;H1 CLASS=chapter&gt;
  ...
</pre>
</div>


<DIV class="propdef">
<H4 class=propname>
    <a name="propdef-page-break-after">
       <span class="index-def" title="'page-break-after', definition of">
       'page-break-after'</span></a></H4>
<TABLE class="propinfo"><TR><TH align="right">Property name:<TD>page-break-after</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Value:<TD>auto | always | left | right</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Initial:<TD>auto</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Applies to:<TD>block level and inline elements
	      except those within tables</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Inherited:<TD>no</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Percentage values:<TD>N/A</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>The values mean the following:

<dl>
<dt>auto</dt>
<dd>do a page break after the element only if necessary <SPAN CLASS=change>(e.g. if
there is no remaining space on the current page)</SPAN></dd>
<dt>always</dt>
<dd>always do a page break after the element </dd>
<dt>left</dt>
<dd>do one or two page breaks after the element until a blank left page is reached </dd>
<dt>right</dt>
<dd>do one or two page breaks after the element until a blank right page is reached </dd>
</dl>


<p>If there are conflicts between this property and the <span
class="propinst-page-break-before">'page-break-before'</span> value on
the previous element (as formatted on the canvas), the value that
results in the largest number of page breaks will be used.

<div class="example"><P>
For example, in HTML, a hard page break may be inserted in the document with
the BR element as follows:

<pre>
  &lt;STYLE&gt;
    BR.page { page-break-after: always }
  &lt;/STYLE&gt;
  ...
  &lt;BR CLASS=page&gt;
  ...
</pre>
</div>

<H3>Page boxes</H3>

<p>Normally, CSS declarations are attached to elements. For example,
to set the font size of a paragraph, a <span
class="propinst-font-size">'font-size'</span> declaration can be
attached to a P element. To accommodate object languages that have no
element that corresponds to the page (e.g., HTML), CSS allows authors
to assign page information through the <span class="index-def"
title="@page">@page</span> rule.

<div class="example"><P>
For example, the following @page rule sets the margins of the page to 2cm.

<pre>
   @page { margin: 2cm }
</pre>
</div>

<p>Declarations inside the curly braces of the @page rule apply to the
pages of a document. These declarations are said to be in the <span
class="index-def" title="page-context"><em>page context</em></span>,
and they describe a page into which the elements of the document are
flowed according to the <a href="./flowobj.html">visual flow
model</a>. This is known as the <span class="index-def" title="page
box"><em>page box</em></span> Indeed, the page is a box similar to the
boxes that surround each element and some of the same properties that
affect boxes (see the section on the <a
href="flowobj.html#box-model">box model</a>) apply to pages, namely:

<ul>
<li><span class="propinst-margin-top">'margin-top'</span>
<li><span class="propinst-margin-right">'margin-right'</span>
<li><span class="propinst-margin-bottom">'margin-bottom'</span>
<li><span class="propinst-margin-left">'margin-left'</span>
<li><span class="propinst-margin">'margin'</span>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the page context allows the <span
class="propinst-size">'size'</span> property to set the size of the
page box and the <span class="propinst-marks">'marks'</span> property
to set crop and cross marks. 

<P>The diagram below shows the relationships between the sheet, page
box and margin properties.

<PRE>

  |  |    ______________    |&lt;-+-- page box

  |  |   |              |&lt;--+--+-- page box minus margins
  |  |   |              |   |  |
  |  |   |              |   |  |
  |  |   |              |   |  |
  |  |   |______________|   |  |   A: margin-top
  |  |    C                 |  |   B: margin-right
  |  |______________________|  |   C: margin-bottom
  |                            |   D: margin-left
  |____________________________|

</PRE>

<p>Note that while the margins are <EM>outside</EM> the boxes
surrounding <SPAN CLASS=change>elements</SPAN>, they are
<EM>inside</EM> the page boxes. 

<div class="note"><P> 
<em>In the future, the <a
href="./flowobj.html#border-properties">border properties</a> and <a
href="./flowobj.html#padding-properties">padding properties</a> may
also be supported.
</em>
</div>

<P>The CSS2 rules for collapsing vertical margins apply to page
margins as well (see the section on <a
href="flowobj2.html#collapsing-margin">collapsing margins for more
information). For example, the margin of the upper element on a page
will be collapsed with the page margin.

<p>The page context has no notion of fonts, so 'em' and 'ex' units are
not allowed. Percentage values on the margin properties are relative
to the page box.  All other units associated with the respective CSS2
properties are allowed.

<P>Due to negative margin values (either on the page box or on
elements) or <a href="flowobj.html#absolute-positioning">absolute
positioning</a> content may end up outside the page box, but this
content may be cut -- by the UA, by the printer or ultimately by the
paper cutter.

<DIV class="propdef">
<H4 class=propname>
    <a name="propdef-size">
       <span class="index-def" title="'size', definition of">
       'size'</span></a></H4>
<TABLE class="propinfo"><TR><TH align="right">Property name:<TD>size</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Value:<TD><span class="index-inst"
		title="&lt;length&gt;"><span
		  class="value-inst-length">&lt;length&gt;</span></span> | auto | portrait | landscape</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Initial:<TD>auto</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Applies to:<TD>page context</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Inherited:<TD>N/A</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Percentage values:<TD>N/A</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>This property describes the size and orientation of a page box.
Page boxes can be either absolute or relative. Typically, relative
page boxes are used for scalable presentations that make optimal use
of the target size, while absolute page boxes are used only when it is
important to achieve very accurate formatting.

<P>For most printouts, document scalability (i.e., fitting available
sheet sizes) is more important than achieving exact dimensions and
<span class="index-def" title="relative page box|page box, relative"><em>relative page
boxes</em></span> allow style sheet designers to easily achieve this.

<P>Three keyword values describe relative page boxes:

<DL>
<DT>auto

<DD>the page box will be set to the target's size and orientatation.
This is the initial value of the property.

<div class="example"><P>
<pre>
  @page {
    size: auto;
    margin: 10%;
  }
</pre>

<p>In the above example, the outer edges of the page box will align
with the target. (Since 'auto' is the initial value on <span
class="propinst-size">'size'</span>, it is normally not necessary to
set this value.) The percentage value on the <span
class="propinst-margin">'margin'</span> property is relative to the
target size so if the target is 21.0cm x 29.7cm (a.k.a. A4), the
margins are 2.10cm and 2.97cm.
</div>


<DT>landscape

<DD>the page box will have the same size as the target, and the normal
direction of print occurs across the largest dimension of the target.
Thus, the target orientation will be ignored.

<DT>portrait

<DD>the page box will have the same size as the target, and the normal
direction of print occurs across the shortest dimension of the target.
Thus, the target orientation will be ignored.

</DL>

<P><span class="index-def" title="absolute page box|page box, absolute"><EM>Absolute
page boxes</em></span> are described with one or two length
		values. 

<div class="example"><P>
For example:

<PRE>
  @page {
    size: 8.5in 11in;  /* width height */
  }
</PRE>

<P>The above example set the width of the page box to be 8.5in and the
height to be 11in. If only one length value is specified, it sets both
the width and height of the page box. Since the page box has no
"parent" percentage values are not allowed on the 'size' property.

<P>The page box in the above example will need a target size of
8.5&quot;x11&quot; or bigger to be printed. 
</div>


<P>If the page box does not fit the target, the UA may choose to:

<UL>
<LI>rotate the page box 90° if this will make the page box fit the target
<LI>scale the page to fit the target
</UL>

<P>The UA should consult the user before performing these operations.

<P>When the page box is smaller than the target size, the UA is free
to place the page box anywhere on the sheet. However, it is
recommended that the page box is centered on the sheet since this will
align double-sided pages and avoid accidental loss of information that
is printed near the edge of the sheet.

<div class="note"><P>
<em><strong>Note.</strong>
Typically, 8.5&quot;x11&quot; sheet size will be available in North
America, while printers in other parts of the world are more likely to
have the A4 sheet size available. 
</em>
</div>

<DIV class="propdef">
<H4 class=propname>
    <a name="propdef-marks">
       <span class="index-def" title="'marks', definition of">
       'marks'</span></a></H4>
<TABLE class="propinfo"><TR><TH align="right">Property name:<TD>marks</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Value:<TD>crop || cross | none</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Initial:<TD>none</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Applies to:<TD>page context</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Inherited:<TD>N/A</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Percentage values:<TD>N/A</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<p>In high-quality printing, various marks are often added outside the
page box. <span class="index-def" title="crop marks"><EM>Crop
marks</EM></span> indicate where the page should be cut and <span
class="index-def" title="cross marks"><EM>cross marks</em></span>
(also known as register marks or registration marks) are used to align
sheets. This property describes what marks should be printed on the
page outside the outer edges of the page box.

<P>Marks are only visible on absolute page boxes. In relative page
boxes the page box will be aligned with the target and the marks
will be outside the printable area.

<P>The size, style and position of cross marks is UA dependent.

<h3>Pseudo-class page boxes</H3>

<P>When printing double-sided documents, the page boxes on left and
right pages should be different. This can be expressed through the
pseudo-class mechanism. 

<P>All pages are automatically classified into either the
<span class="index-def" title=":left|pseudo class, :left">:left</span>
or <span class="index-def" title=":right|pseudo class, :right">:right</span>
pseudo-class. 

<div class="example"><P>
<PRE>
  @page :left {
    margin-left: 4cm;
    margin-right: 3cm;
  }

  @page :right {
    margin-left: 3cm;
    margin-right: 4cm;
  }
</PRE>
</div>

<P>Adding declarations to the :left or :right pseudo-class does not
influence whether the document comes out of the printer double- or
single-sided (which is outside the scope of this specification). If
different declarations have been given for left and right pages, these
declarations will be honored even if the printer only prints
single-sided. Subsequently, for example, the intended design can be
achieved by copying the single-sided sheets onto double-side sheets.

<P>Whether the first page of a document is :left or :right 
depends on the major writing direction of the document and is
outside the scope of this document. However, to force a :left or :right
	first page, authors may insert a page break before the element
	at the top of the document tree (e.g., the HTML element in HTML).

<div class="note"><P>
<em><strong>Note.</strong>
More named paged (e.g., :first) may be added to future versions of CSS.
</em>
</div>

<h3>Cascading in the page context</H3>

<P>Declarations in the page context cascade just like normal CSS2
declarations.

<div class="example"><P>
Consider the following example:

<PRE>
  @page {
    margin-left: 3cm;
  }

  @page :left {
    margin-left: 4cm;
  }
</PRE>

<P>Due to the higher specificity of the pseudo-class selector (see the
section on <a href="cascase.html#cascading-order">cascading order</a>
for details), the left margin on left pages will be '4cm' and all
other pages (i.e., the right pages) will have a left margin of '3cm'.
</div>

<H2><a name="aural">ACSS: Aural cascading style sheets</a></H2>

<p>Those of us who are sighted are accustomed to visual presentation
of documents, frequently on a bitmapped display.  This is not the only
possible presentation method, however.  Aural presentation, using a
combination of speech synthesis and 'audio icons', provides an
alternative presentation.  This form of presentation is already in
current use by the blind and print-impaired communities.

<p>Often such aural presentation occurs by converting the document to
plain text and feeding this to a 'screen reader' -- software or
hardware that simply reads all the characters on the screen.  This
results in less effective presentation than would be the case if the
<em>document structure</em> were retained. A benefit of separating the
content (e.g., the HTML) and the visual presentation (the stylesheet)
is that other types of presentation can also be offered as options
(other stylesheets). Stylesheet properties for aural presentation can
be used together with visual properties (mixed media) or as an aural
alternative to visual presentation.

<p>Besides the obvious accessibility issues for the blind, there are
other large markets for aural presentation:

<dl>
<dt>in-car use 

<dd><i>keep your eyes on the road ahead, Jack, and search the web for
recommended hotels in the next town up ahead</i>

<dt>industrial and medical documentation systems (intranets)

<dd><i>my hands and eyes are otherwise occupied with your triple bypass
but I would still like your medication records</i>

<dt>home entertainment

<dd><i>images, headlines, movies are fine on the widescreen TV but I
don't want to read body text off the screen from the couch; speak it
to me (perhaps throuh the 5 speaker home theater set-up)</i>

<dt>the illiterate

<dd><i>I understand everything you say, but I don't read very well</i>

</dl>

<p>Hence, aural or mixed aural/visual presentation is likely to increase
in importance over the next few years. Realizing that the aural
rendering is essentially independent of the visual rendering:
 
<ul>

</DIV>

<P>The legal range of percentage values is 0% to 100%. Note that '0%'
<strong>does not mean the same as "silent"</strong>. 0% represents the
<em>minimum audible</em> volume level and 100% corresponds to the
<em>maximum comfortable</em> level. 

<P>There is a fixed mapping between keyword values and percentages:

<UL>
<li>'silent' = no sound at all, the element is spoken silently
<LI>'x-soft' = '0%'
<LI>'soft' = '25%'
<LI>'medium' = '50%'
<LI>'loud' = '75%'
<LI>'x-loud' = '100%'
</UL>

<P><span class="index-def" title="volume">Volume</span>refers to the
median volume of the waveform. In other words, a highly inflected
voice at a volume of 50 might peak well above that. The overall values
are likely to be human adjustable for comfort, for example with a
physical volume control (which would increase both the 0% and 100%
values proportionately); what this property does is adjust the dynamic
range.

<p>The UA should allow the values corresponding to 0% and
100% to be set by the listener. No one setting is universally
applicable; suitable values depend on the equipment in use (speakers,
headphones), the environment (in car, home theater, library) and
personal preferences. Some examples:

<ul>
<li>A browser for in-car use has a setting for when there is lots
of background noise. 0% would map to a fairly high level and 100% to a
quite high level. The speech is easily audible over the road noise but
the overall dynamic range is compressed. Plusher cars with better
insulation allow a wider dynamic range.


<li>Another speech browser is being used in the home, late at night,
(don't annoy the neighbors) or in a shared study room. 0% is set to
a very quiet level and 100% to a fairly quiet level, too. As with the first
example, there is a low slope; the dynamic range is reduced. The
actual volumes are low here, wheras they were high in the first
example.

<li>In a quiet and isolated house, an expensive hi-fi home theatre
setup. 0% is set fairly low and 100% to quite high; there is wide
dynamic range.
</ul>

<p>The same authors stylesheet could be used in all cases, simply by
mapping the 0 and 100 points suitably at the client side.

<p>If an element has a volume of silent, it is spoken silently. It
takes up the same time as if it had been spoken, including any pause
before and after the element, but no sound is generated. This may be
used in language teaching applications, for example. A pause is
generated for the pupil to speak the element themselves. Note that since
the value of this property is inherited, child elements will also
be silent.  Child elements may however set the volume to a non-silent
value and will then be spoken.

<p>To inhibit the speaking of an element and all it's children so that
it takes no time at all (for example, to get the effect of collapsing
and expanding lists) set the <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> property to 'none'.  When
using the rule <tt>display: none</tt> the element takes up <em>no
time</em>; it is not represented as a pause the length of the spoken
text.

<P>This property specifies the pause before an element is spoken. It
may be given in an absolute units (seconds, milliseconds) or as a
relative value, in which case it is relative to the reciprocal of the
<span class="propinst-speech-rate">'speech-rate'</span> property. If
speech-rate is 120 words per minute (i.e., a word takes half a second,
500 milliseconds) then a <span
class="propinst-pause-before">'pause-before'</span> of 100% means a
pause of 500 ms and a <span
class="propinst-pause-before">'pause-before'</span> of 20% means
100ms.

<p>Using relative units gives more robust stylesheets in the face of
large changes in speech-rate and is recommended practice.

<p>Similar to the <span
class="propinst-cue-before">'cue-before'</span> and <span
class="propinst-cue-after">'cue-after'</span> properties, this
indicates sound to be played during an element as a background (i.e., the
sound is mixed in with the speech).

<p>The optional 'mix' keyword means the sound inherited from the parent
element's play-during property continues to play and the current
element sound (pointed to by the URL) is mixed with it. If 'mix' is not
specified, the sound replaces the sound of the parent element. 

<p>The optional 'repeat' keyword means the sound will repeat if it is
too short to fill the entire duration of the element. Without this
keyword, the sound plays once and then stops. Thuis is similar to the
background repeat properties in CSS2. If the sound is too long for the
element, it is clipped once the element is spoken.

<p>'Auto' means that the sound of the parent element continues to play
(it is not restarted, which would have been the case if this property
inherited)and none means that there is silence - the sound of the
parent element (if any) is silent for the current element and
continues after the current element.

<div class="examples"><P>
Examples:
<PRE>
  BLOCKQUOTE.sad {play-during: url(violins.aiff) }
  BLOCKQUOTE Q {play-during: url(harp.wav) mix}
  SPAN.quiet {play-during: none }
</pre>
</div>

<P>If a stereo icon is dereferenced the central point of the stereo
pair should be placed at the azimuth for that element and the left and
right channels should be placed to either side of this position.

<H3>Spatial properties</H3>

<p>Spatial audio is an important stylistic property for aural
presentation. It provides a natural way to tell several voices apart,
the same way we use in real life (people rarely all stand in the same
spot in a room). Stereo speakers produce a lateral
soundstage. Binaural headphones or the increasingly popular 5-speaker
home theatre setups can generate full surround sound, and
multi-speaker setups can create a true three-dimensional
soundstage. VRML 2.0 also includes spatial audio (and uses the same
azimuth and elevation terms, which originate in astronomy), which
implies that in time consumer-priced spatial audio hardware will
become more widely available.

<DIV class="propdef">
<H4 class=propname>

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>The value is given in the range -360deg &lt;= x &lt; 360deg where
0deg is interpreted as directly ahead in the center of the sound
stage.  90deg is to the right, 180deg behind and 270deg (or,
equivalently and more conveniently, -90deg) to the left. It may also
be specified using absolute keywords:


<P><div align=center><table border="1"><tr><th>keyword<th>value<th>value with 'behind'
<tr><td>left-side <td>270deg <td>270deg
<tr><td>far-left <td>300deg <td>240deg
<tr><td>left <td>320deg <td>220deg
<tr><td>center-left <td>340deg <td>200deg
<tr><td>center <td>0deg <td>180deg
<tr><td>center-right <td>20deg <td>160deg
<tr><td>right <td>40deg <td>140deg
<tr><td>far-right <td>60deg <td>120deg
<tr><td>right-side <td>90deg <td>90deg</tr>
</table></div>

<p>or relative keywords. The value <tt>leftwards</tt> moves the sound
more to the left (subtracts 20 degrees) while the value
<tt>rightwards</tt> moves the sound more to the right (adds 20
degrees). Arithmetic is carried out modulo 360 degrees.

<p>This property is most likely to be implemented by mixing the same
signal into different channels at differing volumes.  It might also
use phase shifting, digital delay, and other such techniques to
provide the illusion of a soundstage.  The precise means used to
acheive this effect and the number of speakers used to do so are
browser dependent - this property merely identifies the desired end
result.

<div class="example"><P>
Examples:
<PRE>
  H1   { azimuth: 30deg }          
  TD.a { azimuth: far-right }          /*  60deg */
  #12  { azimuth: behind far-right }   /* 120deg */
  P.comment { azimith: behind }        /* 180deg */
</PRE>
</div>


<p>UAs should attempt to honor this request if they have resources to
do so. If spatial-azimuth is specified and the output device cannot
produce sounds <em>behind</em> the listening position, values in the
rearwards hemisphere should be converted into forwards hemisphere
values.  One method is as follows:

<ul>
    <li>if 90deg &lt; x &lt;= 180deg then x := 180deg - x
    <li>if 180deg &lt; x &lt;= 270deg then x := 540deg - x

<P>The value is given in degrees in the range -90deg to 90deg. 0deg is
interpreted as on the forward horizon, which loosely means level with
the listener.  90deg is directly overhead and -90 is directly
underneath.  The precise means used to acheive this effect and the

more strongly inflected.  It is in a sense dual to the <span
class="propinst-pitch-range">'pitch-range'</span> property and is
provided to allow developers to exploit higher-end auditory displays.

braces, and so on are to be spoken literally. The default value of
'none' means that punctuation is not spoken but instead is rendered
naturally as various pauses.

<p>This is a request about how any dates should be
spoken. month-day-year is common in the USA, while day-month-year is
common in Europe and year-month-day is also used.

<div class="example"><P>
This would be useful, for example, when combined with a new
HTML tag used to identify dates, such as:

<pre>
   &lt;p&gt;The campaign started on &lt;date value="1874-oct-21"&gt;
   the twenty-first of that month&lt;/date&gt; and finished 
   &lt;date value="1874-oct-28"&gt;a week later&lt;/date&gt;
