      <h1>Long description for illustration of margin/border
behavior on split inline box</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates the behavior of margins, borders, and
padding at the split points of an inline box.

<P>The illustration shows the rendering of the HTML example preceding
the image in the main document, the paragraph "Several emphasized
words appear here." The inline box containing the words "emphasized
text" is split between the words. At the split point, padding, borders
(dashed to emphasize them), and margins are not rendered.
