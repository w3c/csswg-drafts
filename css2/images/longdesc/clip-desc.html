      <h1>Long description for example clipping region</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates two block boxes, one above the other, with
rectangular clipping regions of different dimensions.

<P>The block boxes (generated for a P element) are identical and
depicted with a thick black border and a gray background.  A
coordinate system has its origin at the upper left corner of each
block box. The x-axis increases along the top edge of the P box, the
y-axis down the left edge. Both axes depict increments of 5px.

<P>The clipping region of the first P box lies entirely within it,
offset 5px from the top and left edges of the P box, and 10px from the
right and bottom edges. The clipping region has a thick dashed border
and a white background and is labeled "clip region".

<P>The clipping region of the second P box resembles that of the first
in style and position, except that the right edge is 5px to the right
of the P box's right edge. Thus, the clipping region lies partially
outside the P box.
