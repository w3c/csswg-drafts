      <h1>Long description of example illustrating the collapsing
borders model</h1>

<P>This diagram shows the effect of the 'collapse' value of the
'border-collapse' property.

<P>The diagram shows three cells in the same row and the grid lines
that separate them. The left and right content, padding, border, and
margin areas of each cell are labeled by rotated text above each of
the areas. Each (red, dotted) grid line bisects the border between two
cells.

<P>The table width is indicated below the cells as encompassing all
the left and right content, padding, border, and margin areas of the
cells, except for the cells that touch the sides of the table. In this
case, only half the exterior border widths are counted in the table's
width.
