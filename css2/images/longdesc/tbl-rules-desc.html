      <h1>Long description of example illustrating rows separated
by a border</h1>

<P>This diagram shows how the precedence rules may be used
to achieve the effect of rows being separated by a border. There
is no border above or below the table and there are no vertical
borders at all.

<P>The table shows a table of three columns and three rows. Each
cell contains an integer that labels it. The top row is separated
from the second by a solid black border. The second row is separated
from the third by a solid black border as well.
