      <h1>Long description for example showing caption to the left of a table</h1>

<P>This diagram shows the relationship between a table and a
caption to its left and how they behave in the visual formatting
model.

<P>The diagram shows a table with 3 columns, one row of headers, and
six rows of data cells. The table is centered within its containing
block, whose left and right edges are depicted by vertical lines and
labeled "current margins". A paragraph of text precedes the table.

<P>To the left of the left containing block edge, a right-justified
paragraph of five lines is aligned with the bottom of the table.
Thus, this left caption lies in the left margin of the body.
