      <h1>Long description for example with clipped overflow</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates how content may be clipped.

<P>One box, with a red border, is shown. In the lower right hand
quadrant of this (DIV) box, part of the text contents of the
BLOCKQUOTE element, with a dashed top and left border, are shown.  The
rest of the text is not visible since it is clipped by the DIV box,
whose 'overflow' property has the value 'hidden'.
