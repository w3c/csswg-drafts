      <h1>Long description of example of cell background calculation</h1>

<P>This diagram shows the six superimposed "layers" of the CSS
table model. This diagram illustrates the algorithm for 
calculating a cell's final background.

<P>The six layers are depicted as prioritized rectangles floating one
above the other in a three-dimensional space (i.e., layers are drawn
as rhombuses to give the impression of space).  The rectangles
represent, from top to bottom: cells, rows, row groups, columns,
column groups, and the table itself.

<P>The diagram shows how, looking down on the six rectangles, one may
compute the background color of each cell. On the top layer, each cell
that specifies a background is shown as a gray box with a black
border.  A cell without a background color in the top layer is
depicted as a "window" onto the lower layers, which give its final
background color. The same visual metaphor is used at each layer, so a
row without a background acts as a window onto the row group layer,
etc.
