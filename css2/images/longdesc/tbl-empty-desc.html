      <h1>Long description of example illustrating background calculation</h1>

<P>This diagram shows a small table with three transparent cells
and illustrates how their final background is determined.

<P>The table consists of two rows. Four (labeled) cells lie in the
first row, but the second cell spans the first and second row.  The
first, third, and fourth cells of the second row are "empty".

<P>Each non-empty cell has a red background and a double black
border. Each empty cell has the table's background color (specified as
#ff0) as its own.
