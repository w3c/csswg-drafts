      <h1>Long description of example illustrating the separated
      borders model</h1>

<P>This diagram shows the effect of the 'separate' value of the
'border-collapse' property.

<P>The diagram shows a three column, two row table whose cells are
subject to the separated borders model. The cells themselves
have a grey background color and an 'inset' border style, which
makes them appear to sink into the page. The cells are separated
from each other on all sides by 15pt worth of grey space.

<P>The table itself has a 10pt 'outset' border that gives one
the impression the table is rising out of the page.

<P>The full effect of the table is that of a bay window with
three panes in two rows.
