<p>The normative version of the Recommendation is in English. However,
we encourage translations of the document.  If you are in a position
to help with this, please write to <a
href="mailto:css2-editors@w3.org">css2-editors@w3.org</a>.  We expect
you to give us permission to republish the translated version and to
allow readers to make copies without restrictions.
