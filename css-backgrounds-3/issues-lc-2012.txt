Closed:   Accepted (solution C)

Summary:  Unclear what border style is used on table cells, when
	  'border-image-source' doesn't apply

Comment:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0109.html

Edit: 	  Added “(or doesn't apply)” after “cannot be displayed”; and added
	  “otherwise the element's borders are invisible and
	  the border image is drawn as described in the sections below.”

Issue:    22
Summary:  Clarify how border-image applies to table elements with
	  collapsing borders (relation to border conflict resolution)
From:     Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu
Comment:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0109.html
Response: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0602.html
Edit: 	  Added “otherwise the element's borders are
	  invisible and the border image is drawn”.
Edit:	  Proposal for the rest has two options:
	  (A) draw the table borders with invisible
	  ink and then draw the image on top of it; or (B) an image border
	  overrides any other border in the conflict resolution. (The
	  difference is the calculation of the width of each cell.)
Edit: 	  WG decision:
	  Make interaction of border-image with collapsed tables
	  undefined, recommend not applying it to such tables in L3,
	  expect it to be defined in L4.
Edit:	  Edited as per the WG decision. (Added section 6.8.)
Closed:	  Accepted

Issue 23
Summary:  Ambiguous phrasing about 'inset' and tables

Comment:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0106.html
Closed:   Accepted
Edit: 	  Edited (copied wording from CSS 2.1: “In the collapsing
	  border model, drawn the same as 'ridge'.”)

Issue 24
Summary:  Line thickness in 4.3 uses ambiguous words “may not”
	  (“may not be negative”). Should say: “are not allowed.”
From:     Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu

Edit: 	  Edited

Issue 25
Summary:  Allow colors (esp. semi-transparent ones) on all background layers.
Edit:	  Tab says (1st response) it's no longer needed, because you
	  can soon use 'image(red)' anywhere a URL is allowed, and (2nd
	  response) that it would throw off the layer counting for the
	  'background-color' property.
