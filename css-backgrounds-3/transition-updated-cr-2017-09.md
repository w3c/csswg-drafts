## Requirements satisfied

There is no specific requirements document for this specification. The work 
is within the scope defined in the CSS WG's charter,

## Dependencies met (or not)

The following normative references are not yet at CR:

* CSS Color Module Level 4     (FPWD)
* CSS Display Module Level 3   (WD)
* CSS Overflow Module Level 3   (WD)
* CSS Level 2 Revision 2 (CSS 2.2) Specification  (FPWD)

These are primarily to link to the latest definitions of each term. 

## Wide Review

The document went through a (2005 process) first Last Call WD in  February 2012 and then transitioned 
to a first CR in April 2012, followed by a second CR 24 July 2012.
It was returned to Last Call WD in February 2014 to process further comments due to implementation experience
(per 2005 process rules), and transitioned back to CR in September 2014. Much of that CR has been implemented.



There has now been additional implementation feedback from multiple browsers. 
All current feedback has been addressed and collected in the latest Disposition 
of Comments, so we would like to publish a new CR.
