Introduction {#intro}
=====================

	<em>This section is not normative.</em>

	Web developers, design tools and design system developers
	often use color functions to assist in scaling the design
	of their component color relations.
	With the increasing usage of design systems that support multiple platforms
	and multiple user preferences, like the increased capability of Dark Mode in UI,
	this becomes even more useful to not need to manually set color,
	and to instead have a single source from which schemes are calculated.

	Currently Sass, calc() on HSL values, or PostCSS is used to do this.
	Preprocessors are unable to work on dynamically adjusted colors,
	all current solutions are restricted to the sRGB gamut
	and to the perceptual limitations of HSL
	(colors are bunched up in the color wheel,
	and two colors with visually different lightness,
	like yellow and blue, can have the same HSL lightness).

	This module adds three functions:
	''color-mix'',
	''color-contrast'',
	and [[#colormodify|a way to modify colors]].

	The perceptually uniform ``lch()`` colorspace
	is used for mixing by default,
	as this has no gamut restrictions
	and colors are evenly distributed.
	However, other colorspaces can be specified,
	including ``hsl()`` or ``srgb`` if desired.

Mixing colors: the ''color-mix'' function {#colormix}
=====================================================

	This function takes two <<color>> specifications
	and returns the result of mixing them,
	in a given [=colorspace=],
	by a specified amount.

	Unless otherwise specified,
	the mixing is done in the ''lch()'' colorspace.

	Multiple color functions can be specified.


<pre class='prod'>
	<dfn>color-mix()</dfn> = color-mix( <<color>>  <<color>> [ <<number>> | <<percentage>> |
		[ <<color-function>> <<colorspace>>? ]?] )
</pre>

Issue(4747): <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4747">color-function used but not defined</a>

When a plain number or percentage is specified,
it applies to all color channels.

If the plain number or percentage is omitted,
it defaults to 50% (an equal mix of the two colors).

<div class="example">
	This example produces a mixture of 40% <span class="swatch" style="--color: peru"></span> peru
	and 60% <span class="swatch" style="--color: lightgoldenrod"></span> lightgoldenrod.

	<pre class="lang-css">color-mix(peru lightgoldenrod 40%)</pre>

	The mixing is done in ''lch()'' colorspace.
	Here is a top-down view, looking along the neutral L axis:

	<figure>
		<img src="images/CH-mixing.svg" style="width: 50vmin">
		<figcaption>Mixtures of peru and lightgoldenrod.
			Peru has a hue angle, measured from the positive a axis,
			of 63.677 degrees
			while lightgoldenrod has a hue angle of 98.821 degrees.
			Peru has a chroma, or distance from the central neutral axis, of 54.011
			while lightgoldenrod has a chroma of 31.415.
			Mixtures lie along the curve. A 40%/60% mixture is shown.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	The calculation is as follows:
	  * <span class="swatch" style="--color: peru"></span> peru is lch(62.253% 54.011 63.677)
	  * <span class="swatch" style="--color: lightgoldenrod"></span> lightgoldenrod is lch(91.374% 31.415 98.821)
	  * the mixed lightness is 62.253 * 40/100 + 91.374 * (100-40)/100 = 79.7256
	  * the mixed chroma is 54.011 * 40/100 + 31.415 * (100-40)/100 = 40.4534
	  * the mixed hue is 63.677 * 40/100 + 98.821 * (100-40)/100 = 84.7634
	  * the mixed result is <span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(87.41% 76.03% 47.64%)"></span> lch(79.7256% 40.4534 84.7634)
</div>

<div class="example">
	This example produces the mixture of red and yellow,
	in ''lch'' colorspace (the default),
	with each lch channel being 65% of the value for red
	and 35% of the value for yellow.

	Note: interpolating on hue and chroma
	keeps the intermediate colors
	as saturated as the endpoint colors.

	<pre class="lang-css">color-mix(red yellow 65%);</pre>

	<figure>
		<img src="images/CH-mixing3.svg" style="width: 50vmin">
		<figcaption>Mixtures of red and yellow.

			while yellow has a chroma of 94.7077.
			Mixtures lie along the dashed curve. A 65%/35% mixture is shown.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	The calculation is as follows:
		* sRGB  <span class="swatch" style="--color: red"></span> red (#F00) is lch(54.2917% 106.8390 40.8526)
		* sRGB <span class="swatch" style="--color: yellow"></span>  yellow (#FF0) is lch(97.6071% 94.7077 99.5746)
		* mixed lightness is 54.2917 * 0.65 + 97.6071 * 0.35 = 69.4521

		* mixed hue is 40.8526 * 0.65 + 99.5746 * 0.35 = 61.4053
		* mixed result is lch(69.4521% 102.5872 61.4053)
		* which is a red-orange: <span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(75.3600% 65.6304% 16.9796%)"></span>  rgb(75.3600% 65.6304% 16.9796%)

</div>

Instead of mixing all channels equally, color functions can be used
to only mix certain channels. The unmixed channels in the result
are copied across from the first color.

<div class="example">
	This example produces the mixture of a deep green and a sky blue,
	in ''lch()'' colorspace (the default),
	with the lightness being 40% of the lightness of the green
	(and thus, 60% of the lightness of the blue).
	The chroma and hue of the green are used unchanged in the mixed result.

	  * mixed lightness is 40.083 * 0.4 + 70% * (1 - 0.4) = 58.0332

</div>

<div class="example">
	This example produces the mixture of a red and a sky blue,
	in ''lch()'' colorspace (the default),
	with the hue being 75.23% of that of the red
	(and thus, 24.77% of that of the blue).
	The chroma and lightness of the red are left unchanged.

	<pre class="lang-css">color-mix(lch(52% 58.1 22.7) lch(56% 49.1 257.1) hue(75.23%));</pre>

Selecting the most contrasting color: the ''color-contrast()'' function {#colorcontrast}
========================================================================================

	This function takes, firstly, a single color
	(typically a background, but not necessarily),
	and then second, a list of two or more colors;
	it selects from that list
	the color with highest <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum">luminance contrast</a> [[!WCAG21]]
	to the single color.

	<pre class='prod'>
		<dfn>color-contrast()</dfn> = color-contrast( <<color>>  <<color>>#  )
	</pre>

	Issue(#4749): <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4749">add target contrast ratio to color-contrast?</a>

	<div class="example">
		<pre class="lang-css">color-contrast(wheat tan, sienna, var(--myAccent), #d2691e)</pre>

		The calculation is as follows:
			* <span class="swatch" style="--color: wheat"></span> wheat (#f5deb3), the background, has relative luminance 0.749
			* <span class="swatch" style="--color: tan"></span> tan (#d2b48c) has relative luminance 0.482 and contrast ratio <strong>1.501</strong>
			* <span class="swatch" style="--color: sienna"></span> sienna (#a0522d) has relative luminance 0.137 and contrast ratio <strong>4.273</strong>

		Suppose myAccent has the value <span class="swatch" style="--color: #b22222"></span>  #b22222:
			* #b22222 has relative luminance 0.107 and contrast ratio <strong>5.081</strong>
			* <span class="swatch" style="--color: #d2691e"></span> #d2691e has relative luminance 0.305 and contrast ratio <strong>2.249</strong>
		The highest contrast ratio is <strong>5.081</strong> so var(--myAccent) wins

	</div>

	The colors in the list are tested sequentially,
	from left to right;
	a color is the temporary winner
	if it has  the highest contrast of all those tested so far,
	and once the end of the list is reached, the current temporary winner is the overall winner.
	Thus, if two colors in the list happen to have the same contrast,
	the earlier in the list wins
	because the later one has the same contrast, not higher.

	<div class="example">
		<pre class="lang-css">
			foo {
				--bg: hsl(200 50% 80%);
				--purple-in-hsl: hsl(300 100% 25%);
				color: color-contrast(var(--bg) hsl(200 83% 23%), purple, var(--purple-in-hsl));
			  }
		</pre>

		The calculation is as follows:

			* <span class="swatch" style="--color: hsl(200 50% 80%)"></span> --bg is rgb(179 213 230) which has relative luminance 0.628835
			* <span class="swatch" style="--color: hsl(200 83% 23%)"></span> hsl(200 83% 23%) is rgb(10 75 107) which has relative luminance 0.061575 and contrast ratio <strong>6.08409</strong>
			* <span class="swatch" style="--color: purple"></span> purple is rgb(128 0 128) which has relative luminance 0.061487 and contrast ratio <strong>6.08889</strong>
			* <span class="swatch" style="--color: hsl(300 100% 25%)"></span> --purple-in-hsl is also rgb(128 0 128) which has relative luminance 0.061487 and contrast ratio <strong>6.08889</strong>. This is not greater than the contrast for purple, so purple wins.

		The calculated values here are shown to six significant figures, to demonstrate that early rounding to a lower precision would have given the wrong result (0.061575 is very close to 0.061487;
		6.08409 is very close to 6.08889).

Modifying colors {#colormodify}
===============================

Note: There are currently two proposals for modifying colors:
''color-adjust'' and [[#relative-colors|Relative color syntax]].

Issue(3187): there are two proposals for color modification (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3187#issuecomment-499126198">proposal 1</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/una/edcfa0d3600e0b89b2ebf266bf549721">proposal 2</a>).
The CSS WG expects that the best aspects of each
will be chosen to produce a single eventual solution.

<!--
	From minutes of Toronto f2f
	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2019Jul/0008.html

Adjusting colors: the ''color-adjust'' function {#coloradjust}
--------------------------------------------------------------

	This function takes one <<color>> specification
	and returns the result of adjusting that color,
	in a given colorspace,
	by a specified transform function.

	Unless otherwise specified,
	the adjustment is done in the ''lch()'' colorspace.

	Multiple color functions can be specified.

	<pre class='prod'>
		<dfn>color-adjust()</dfn> = color-adjust( <<color>> [ color-function <<colorspace>>? ]?] )
	</pre>

	<div class="example">
		This example produces the adjustment of peru (#CD853F),
		in ''lch()'' colorspace (the default),
		with the lightness being reduced by 20%.
		The chroma and hue of red are left unchanged.

		<pre class="lang-css">color-adjust(peru lightness(-20%));</pre>

		The calculation is as follows:
		* <span class="swatch" style="--color: peru"></span> peru (#CD853F) is lch(62.2532% 54.0114 63.6769)

Relative color syntax {#relative-colors}
--------------------------------------------------------

Besides specifying absolute coordinates, all color functions can also be used with a *relative syntax* to produce colors in the function's target color space, based on an existing color (henceforth referred to as "origin color"). This syntax consists of the keyword ''from'', a <<color>> value, and optionally numerical coordinates specific to the color function. To allow calculations on the original color's coordinates, there are single-letter keywords for each coordinate and `alpha` that corresponds to the color's alpha. If no coordinates are specified, the function merely converts the origin color to the target function's color space.

The following sections outline the relative color syntax for each color function.

Issue: A future version of this specification may define a relative syntax for ''color()'' as well.

<h4 id="relative-RGB">Relative RGB colors</h4>

The grammar of the ''rgb()'' function is extended as follows:

<pre class='prod'>
<dfn>rgb()</dfn> = rgb([from <<color>>]? <<percentage>>{3} [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? ) |
		rgb([from <<color>>]? <<number>>{3} [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? )
<dfn>&lt;alpha-value></dfn> = <<number>> | <<percentage>>
</pre>

When an origin color is present, the following keywords can also be used in this function (provided the end result conforms to the expected type for the parameter) and correspond to:

- 'r' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's red channel after its conversion to sRGB
- 'g' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's green channel after its conversion to sRGB
- 'b' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's blue channel after its conversion to sRGB
- 'alpha' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's alpha transparency

<div class="example">
	To manipulate color channels in the sRGB colorspace:

	<pre>
		rgb(from <span class="swatch" style="--color: indianred"></span> indianred 255 g b)
	</pre>

	This takes the sRGB value of indianred (205 92 92) and replaces the red channel with 255 to give <span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(255 92 92)"></span>  rgb(255 92 92).
</div>

<h4 id="relative-HSL">Relative HSL colors</h4>

The grammar of the ''hsl()'' function is extended as follows:

<pre class='prod'>
<dfn>hsl()</dfn> = hsl([from <<color>>]? <<hue>> <<percentage>> <<percentage>> [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? )
<dfn>&lt;hue></dfn> = <<number>> | <<angle>>
</pre>

When an origin color is present, the following keywords can also be used in this function (provided the end result conforms to the expected type for the parameter) and correspond to:

- 'h' is a <<number>> that corresponds to the origin color's HSL hue after its conversion to sRGB, normalized to a [0, 360) range.
- 's' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's HSL saturation after its conversion to sRGB
- 'l' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's HSL lightness after its conversion to sRGB
- 'alpha' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's alpha transparency

<div class="example">
	This adds 180 degrees to the hue angle, giving a complementary color.
	<pre>
		--accent: <span class="swatch" style="--color: lightseagreen"></span> lightseagreen;
		--complement:  <span class="swatch" style="--color: hsl(357deg 70% 41%)"></span> hsl(from var(--accent) calc(h+180) s l);
	</pre>
	lightseagreen is hsl(177deg 70% 41%), so --complement is <span class="swatch" style="--color: hsl(357deg 70% 41%)"></span> hsl(357deg 70% 41%)
</div>

<h4 id="relative-HWB">Relative HWB colors</h4>

The grammar of the ''hwb()'' function is extended as follows:

<pre class='prod'>
	<dfn>hwb()</dfn> = hwb([from <<color>>]? <<hue>> <<percentage>> <<percentage>> [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? )
</pre>

When an origin color is present, the following keywords can also be used in this function (provided the end result conforms to the expected type for the parameter) and correspond to:

- 'h' is a <<number>> that corresponds to the origin color's HWB hue after its conversion to sRGB
- 'w' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's HWB whiteness after its conversion to sRGB
- 'b' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's HWB blackness after its conversion to sRGB
- 'alpha' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's alpha transparency

<h4 id="relative-Lab">Relative Lab colors</h4>

The grammar of the ''lab()'' function is extended as follows:

<pre class='prod'>
<dfn>lab()</dfn> = lab([from <<color>>]? <<percentage>> <<number>> <<number>> [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? )
</pre>

When an origin color is present, the following keywords can also be used in this function (provided the end result conforms to the expected type for the parameter) and correspond to:

- 'l' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's CIE Lightness
- 'a' is a <<number>> that corresponds to the origin color's CIELab a axis
- 'b' is a <<number>> that corresponds to the origin color's CIELab b axis
- 'alpha' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's alpha transparency

<div class="example">
	Multiple ways to adjust the transparency of a base color:

	* ''lab(from var(--mycolor) l a b / 100%)'' sets the alpha of ''var(--mycolor)'' to 100% regardless of what it originally was.
	* ''lab(from var(--mycolor) l a b / calc(alpha * 0.8))'' reduces the alpha of ''var(--mycolor)'' by 20% of its original value.
	* ''lab(from var(--mycolor) l a b / calc(alpha - 20%))'' reduces the alpha of ''var(--mycolor)'' by 20% of 100%.

	Note that all the adjustments are lossless in the sense that no gamut clipping occurs, since lab() encompasses all visible color.
	This is not true for the alpha adjustments in the sRGB based functions (such as'rgb()', 'hsl()', or 'hwb()'), which would also convert to sRGB in addition to adjusting the alpha transparency.
</div>

<div class="example">
	Fully desaturating a color to gray, keeping the exact same lightness:

	<pre>
	--mycolor: <span class="swatch" style="--color: orchid"></span> orchid;
	// orchid is lab(62.753% 52.460 -34.103)
	--mygray: <span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(59.515% 59.515% 59.515%)"></span> lab(from var(--mycolor) l 0 0)
	// mygray is lab(62.753% 0 0) which is rgb(59.515% 59.515% 59.515%)
	</pre>
</div>

<h4 id="relative-LCH">Relative LCH colors</h4>

The grammar of the ''lch()'' function is extended as follows:

<pre class='prod'>
<dfn>lch()</dfn> = lch([from <<color>>]? <<percentage>> <<number>> <<hue>> [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? )
</pre>

When an origin color is present, the following keywords can also be used in this function (provided the end result conforms to the expected type for the parameter) and correspond to:

- 'l' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's CIE Lightness
- 'c' is a <<number>> that corresponds to the origin color's LCH chroma
- 'h' is a <<number>> that corresponds to the origin color's LCH hue, normalized to a [0, 360) range.
- 'alpha' is a <<percentage>> that corresponds to the origin color's alpha transparency

<div class="example">
	''lch(from peru calc(l * 0.8) c h)'' produces a color that is 20% darker than <span class="swatch" style="--color: peru"></span> peru or lch(62.2532% 54.0114 63.6769), with its chroma and hue left unchanged.
	The result is <span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(57.58% 32.47% 3.82%)"> </span> lch(49.80256% 54.0114 63.6769)
</div>

<div class="example">
	This adds 180 degrees to the hue angle, giving the complementary color.
	<pre>
		--accent: <span class="swatch" style="--color: lightseagreen"></span> lightseagreen;
		--complement:  <span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(88.2814% 51.1047% 58.3039%"></span> LCH(from var(--accent) l c calc(h+180));
	</pre>
	lightseagreen is LCH(65.4937% 39.4484 190.1013), so --complement is <span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(88.2814% 51.1047% 58.3039%)"></span> LCH(65.4937% 39.4484 370.1013)
</div>

<div class="example">
	Fully desaturating a color to gray, keeping the exact same lightness:

	<pre>
	--mycolor: <span class="swatch" style="--color: orchid"></span> orchid;
	// orchid is lch(62.753% 62.571 326.973)
	--mygray: <span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(59.515% 59.515% 59.515%)"></span> lch(from var(--mycolor) l 0 h)
	// mygray is lch(62.753% 0 326.973) which is rgb(59.515% 59.515% 59.515%)
	</pre>

	But now (since the hue was preserved) <em>re-saturating</em> again

	<pre>
	--mymuted: <span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(72.710% 53.293% 71.224%)"></span> lch(from var(--mygray) l 30 h);
	// mymuted is lch(62.753% 30 326.973) which is rgb(72.710% 53.293% 71.224%)
