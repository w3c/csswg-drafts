Abstract: This module contains the features of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/">CSS</a> relating to the alignment of boxes within their containers in the various CSS box layout models: block layout, table layout, flex layout, and grid layout. (The alignment of text and inline-level content is defined in [[CSS-TEXT-3]] and [[CSS-INLINE-3]].)
Ignored Terms: table cell, stretch, scrollable overflow region
At Risk: ''[ first | last ]? baseline''
At Risk: the <<overflow-position>> keywords
At Risk: the scrollable-area safety trigger into ''safe'' mode when no <<overflow-position>> is specified
At Risk: the ''legacy'' keyword for 'justify-items'

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	<em>This section is not normative.</em>

	CSS Levels 1 and 2 allowed for the alignment of text via 'text-align'
	and the alignment of blocks by balancing ''margin/auto'' margins.
	However, except in table cells,
	vertical alignment was not possible.
	As CSS adds further capabilities,
	the ability to align boxes in various dimensions becomes more critical.
	This module attempts to create a cohesive and common box alignment model to share among all of CSS.

	Note: The alignment of text and inline-level content is defined in [[CSS-TEXT-3]] and [[CSS-INLINE-3]].

	Note: This specification is not intended to change any of the behavior
	defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/">CSS2.1</a>
	when the properties defined here are set to their initial values.
	If implementors or anyone else notices a discrepancy,
	please report this to the CSSWG as an error.

<h3 id="placement">
Module interactions</h3>

	This module adds some new alignment capabilities
	to the block layout model described in [[!CSS2]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html">chapters 9</a>
	and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html">10</a>
	and defines the interaction of these properties
	with the alignment of table cell content using 'vertical-align',
	as defined in [[!CSS2]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#height-layout">chapter 17</a>.

	The interaction of these properties with
	Grid Layout [[!CSS-GRID-1]]
	and Flexible Box Layout [[!CSS-FLEXBOX-1]]
	is defined in their respective modules.
	The property definitions here supersede those in [[!CSS-FLEXBOX-1]]
	(which have a smaller, earlier subset of permissible values).

	No properties in this module apply to the <code>::first-line</code>
	or <code>::first-letter</code> pseudo-elements.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	This specification follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]].
	Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values & Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification
	also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> keywords as their property value.
	For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial Implementations</h3>

	Since it is expected that support for the features in this module
	will be deployed in stages corresponding to the various layout models affected,
	it is hereby clarified that
	the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#partial">rules for partial implementations</a>
	that require treating as invalid any unsupported feature
	apply to any alignment keyword
	which is not supported across all layout modules to which it applies
	for layout models in which the implementation supports the property in general.

	For example,
	if an implementation supports 'align-self' in [[CSS-GRID-1]] and [[CSS-FLEXBOX-1]],
	then it must treat ''align-content/start'' as invalid
	unless it is supported in both grid and flex containers.
	However if that same implementation does not support 'align-self' for block-level elements at all,
	then a lack of implementation of ''align-self: start''
	does not trigger this requirement to treat it as invalid.

<h2 id="overview">
Overview of Alignment Properties</h2>

	The <dfn export>box alignment properties</dfn> in CSS are a set of 6 properties
	that control alignment of boxes within other boxes.
	They can be described along two axises:

	<ul>
		<li>which dimension they apply to ([=main axis|main=]/[=inline axis|inline=] vs. [=cross axis|cross=]/[=block axis|block=]), and
		<li>whether they control the position of the box within its parent, or the box's content within itself.
	</ul>

	Note: This specification uses the terms “justify” and “align” to distinguish
	between alignment in the main/inline and cross/block dimensions, respectively.
	The choice is somewhat arbitrary, but having the two terms allows for
	a consistent naming scheme that works across all of CSS's layout models
	(including [[css-flexbox-1#box-model]])

	The following table summarizes the <a>box alignment properties</a>
	and the display types they can apply to.

	<table class=data>
	<colgroup span=1></colgroup>
	<colgroup span=2></colgroup>
	<colgroup span=1></colgroup>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Common
			<th>Axis
			<th>Aligns
			<th>Applies to
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>'justify-content'
			<td>main/inline
			<td rowspan=2>
				<img src="images/content-example.svg" width=106 height=106 alt="">
				content within element
				<small>(effectively adjusts padding)</small>
			<td rowspan=2>[=block containers=], <a>flex containers</a>, and <a>grid containers</a>
		<tr>
			<th>'align-content'
			<td>cross/block
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>'justify-self'
			<td>inline
			<td rowspan=2>
				<img src="images/self-example.svg" width=106 height=106 alt="">
				element within parent
				<small>(effectively adjusts margins)</small>
			<td>block-level boxes, absolutely-positioned boxes, and <a>grid items</a>
		<tr>
			<th>'align-self'
			<td>cross/block
			<td>absolutely-positioned boxes, <a>flex items</a>, and <a>grid items</a>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>'justify-items'
			<td>inline
			<td rowspan=2>
				<img src="images/items-example.svg" width=106 height=106 alt="">
				items inside box
				<small>(controls child items&rsquo; ''align/justify-self: auto'')</small>
			<td>[=block containers=] and <a>grid containers</a>
		<tr>
			<th>'align-items'
			<td>cross/block
			<td><a>flex containers</a> and <a>grid containers</a>
	</table>

	Note: The '*-items' properties don't affect the element itself.
	When set on a container,
	they specify the interpretation of any ''*-self: auto'' used on children of the container element.

<h2 id='terms'>
Alignment Terminology</h2>

	Since this module defines alignment properties for all layout modes in CSS,
	some abstract terminology is introduced:

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn export>alignment subject</dfn>
		<dd>
			The <a>alignment subject</a> is the thing or things being aligned by the property.
			For 'justify-self' and 'align-self',
			the <a>alignment subject</a> is the margin box of the box the property is set on,
			and assumes the <a>writing mode</a> of that box.
			For 'justify-content' and 'align-content',
			the <a>alignment subject</a> is defined by the layout mode
			and refers to some aspect of its contents;
			it also assumes the <a>writing mode</a> of the box the property is set on.

		<dt><dfn export>alignment container</dfn>
		<dd>
			The <a>alignment container</a> is the rectangle that the <a>alignment subject</a> is aligned within.
			This is defined by the layout mode,
			but is usually the <a>alignment subject</a>’s containing block,
			and assumes the writing mode of the box establishing the containing block.

		<dt><dfn export>fallback alignment</dfn>
		<dd>
			Some alignments can only be fulfilled in certain situations
			or are limited in how much space they can consume;
			for example, ''space-between'' can only operate when there is more than one <a>alignment subject</a>,
			and baseline alignment, once fulfilled, might not be enough to absorb all the excess space.
			In these cases a fallback alignment takes effect
			(as defined below)
			to fully consume the excess space.
	</dl>

<h2 id='alignment-values'>
Alignment Keywords</h2>

	All of the alignment properties use a common set of keyword values,
	which are defined in this section.
	Keywords fall into three categories:

	<dl>
		<dt><a href="#positional-values">positional alignment</a>
		<dd>These keywords define alignment as an absolute position within the <a>alignment container</a>.

		<dt><a href="#baseline-values">baseline alignment</a>
		<dd>These keywords define alignment as a relationship
			among the baselines of multiple [=alignment subjects=] within an <a>alignment context</a>.

		<dt><a href="#distribution-values">distributed alignment</a>
		<dd>These keywords define alignment as a distribution of space among <a>alignment subjects</a>.
	</dl>

<h3 id='positional-values'>
Positional Alignment: the ''center'', ''start'', ''end'', ''self-start'', ''self-end'', ''flex-start'', ''flex-end'', ''left'', and ''right'' keywords</h3>

	The <dfn>positional alignment</dfn> keywords specify a position for an <a>alignment subject</a>
	with respect to its <a>alignment container</a>.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-type="value">
		<dt><dfn for="<self-position>, <content-position>">center</dfn> <small>([[#self-alignment|self]], [[#content-distribution|content]])</small>
		<dd>Centers the <a>alignment subject</a> within its <a>alignment container</a>.

		<dt><dfn for="<self-position>, <content-position>">start</dfn> <small>([[#self-alignment|self]], [[#content-distribution|content]])</small>
		<dd>Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the <a>alignment container</a>’s start edge in the appropriate axis.

		<dt><dfn for="<self-position>, <content-position>">end</dfn> <small>([[#self-alignment|self]], [[#content-distribution|content]])</small>
		<dd>Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the <a>alignment container</a>’s end edge in the appropriate axis.

		<dt><dfn for="<self-position>">self-start</dfn> <small>([[#self-alignment|self]])</small>
		<dd>Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the edge of the <a>alignment container</a>
			corresponding to the <a>alignment subject</a>’s start side in the appropriate axis.

		<dt><dfn for="<self-position>">self-end</dfn> <small>([[#self-alignment|self]])</small>
		<dd>Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the edge of the <a>alignment container</a>
			corresponding to the <a>alignment subject</a>’s end side in the appropriate axis.

		<dt><dfn for="<self-position>, <content-position>">flex-start</dfn> <small>([[#self-alignment|self]], [[#content-distribution|content]])</small>
		<dd><strong>Only used in flex layout.</strong> [[!CSS-FLEXBOX-1]]
			Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the edge of the <a>alignment container</a>
			corresponding to the <a>flex container</a>’s main-start or cross-start side, as appropriate.

			When used outside of a <a>flex formatting context</a>, this value behaves as ''start''.
			That is, on boxes that are not <a>flex items</a>
			(or pretending to be <a>flex items</a>,
			such as when determining the static position of an absolutely-positioned box
			that is a child of a <a>flex container</a>),
			this value behaves as ''start'' when used in the <a>self-alignment properties</a>,
			and on boxes that are not <a>flex containers</a>,
			this value behaves as ''start'' when used in the <a>content-distribution properties</a>.

		<dt><dfn for="<self-position>, <content-position>">flex-end</dfn> <small>([[#self-alignment|self]], [[#content-distribution|content]])</small>
		<dd><strong>Only used in flex layout.</strong>
			Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the edge of the <a>alignment container</a>
			corresponding to the <a>flex container</a>’s main-end or cross-end side, as appropriate.

			When used outside of a <a>flex formatting context</a>, this value behaves as ''end''.
			That is, on boxes that are not <a>flex items</a>
			(or pretending to be <a>flex items</a>,
			such as when determining the static position of an absolutely-positioned box
			that is a child of a <a>flex container</a>),
			this value behaves as ''end'' when used in the <a>self-alignment properties</a>,
			and on boxes that are not <a>flex containers</a>,
			this value behaves as ''end'' when used in the <a>content-distribution properties</a>.

		<dt><dfn for="<self-position>, <content-position>">left</dfn> <small>([[#self-alignment|self]], [[#content-distribution|content]])</small>
		<dd>Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with
			the <a>alignment container</a>’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#line-left">line-left</a>
			or <a>physical left</a> edge,
			whichever is in the appropriate axis.
			If the property's axis is not parallel with either left↔right axis,
			this value behaves as ''start''.

		<dt><dfn for="<self-position>, <content-position>">right</dfn> <small>([[#self-alignment|self]], [[#content-distribution|content]])</small>
		<dd>Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with
			the <a>alignment container</a>’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#line-right">line-right</a>
			or <a>physical right</a> edge,
			whichever is in the appropriate axis.
			If the property's axis is not parallel with either left↔right axis,
			this value behaves as ''start''.
	</dl>

	Two grammar terms are used to denote this collection of values:

	<dl>
		<dt><<self-position>>
		<dd>
			This set is used by 'justify-self' and 'align-self'
			to align the box within its <a>alignment container</a>,
			and also by 'justify-items' and 'align-items'
			(to specify default values for 'justify-self' and 'align-self').
			<pre class='prod'>
				<dfn>&lt;self-position></dfn> = center | start | end | self-start | self-end |
								flex-start | flex-end | left | right;
			</pre>
		<dt><<content-position>>
		<dd>
			This set is used by 'justify-content' and 'align-content'
			to align the box's contents within itself.

			<pre class='prod'>
				<dfn>&lt;content-position></dfn> = center | start | end | flex-start | flex-end |
								left | right;
			</pre>
	</dl>

	<aside class=example>
		The ''<self-position>/start'' and ''<self-position>/end'' keywords
		are <a>flow-relative</a>:
		they use the <a>writing mode</a> to determine which side to align to.

			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		The ''<self-position>/left'' and ''<self-position>/right'' keywords
		are absolute (not <a>flow-relative</a>).

		<figure>

			<figcaption>
				''<self-position>/left'' vs ''<self-position>/right''
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		The ''<self-position>/start'' and ''<self-position>/end'' keywords
		have meaning in both the <a lt="inline axis">inline</a> and <a lt="block axis">block</a> axes:
		''<self-position>/start'' always orients to the start of the text
		(top left for left-to-right/top-to-bottom languages like English)
		while ''<self-position>/end'' always orients to the end of the text.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/start-block-tb.svg"
			     style="background: white; padding: 8px; padding-bottom: calc(8px + 23px);"
			     title="block-axis 'start' alignment in various writing systems"

			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		The ''<self-position>/start'' and ''<self-position>/end'' keywords
		use the <a>writing mode</a> of the <a>alignment container</a>,
		to help keep things consistent.
		But if alignment using the <a>alignment subject</a>’s <a>writing mode</a> is needed,
		the ''<self-position>/self-start'' and ''<self-position>/self-end'' keywords can be used.

	<aside class=example>
		The behavior of the alignment keywords is analogous in <a>vertical writing modes</a>:
		''<self-position>/start'' and ''<self-position>/end''
		are relative to the start/end of the text in the relevant axis.
		The ''<self-position>/left'' and ''<self-position>/right'' keywords
		are interpreted as <a>line-left</a> and <a>line-right</a>,
		relative to the “left” and “right” sides of LTR/RTL text.

Baseline Alignment: the ''baseline'' keyword and ''first''/''last'' modifiers</h3>

	See [[css-writing-modes-3#intro-baselines]].

	<dfn export>Baseline alignment</dfn> is a form of positional alignment
	that aligns multiple <a>alignment subjects</a>
	within a <a>shared alignment context</a>
	(such as cells within a row)
	by matching up their <a>alignment baselines</a>.
	If the position of the <a>alignment subjects</a> within a <a>baseline-sharing group</a>
	is not fully constrained by <a>baseline alignment</a>
	(i.e., they could be shifted within their respective <a>alignment containers</a>
	while maintaining baseline-alignment),
	they are [=fallback alignment|fallback-aligned=] insofar as possible while preserving their <a>baseline alignment</a>.

	The baseline alignment keywords are represented with the <<baseline-position>> grammar term:

	<pre class='prod'>
		<dfn>&lt;baseline-position></dfn> = [ first | last ]? baseline
	</pre>

	The ''first'' and ''last'' values give a box a <dfn export>baseline alignment preference</dfn>:
	either “first” or “last”, respectively,
	defaulting to “first”.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="justify-self, justify-items, align-content, align-self, align-items, <baseline-position>">
		<dt><dfn>baseline</dfn>
		<dd>
			Computes to ''first baseline'', defined below.

		<dt><dfn lt="first baseline | first">first baseline</dfn>
		<dd>
			Specifies participation in <dfn dfn for export>first-baseline alignment</dfn>:
			aligns the <a>alignment baseline</a> of the box's <a>first baseline set</a>
			with the corresponding baseline
			of its [=baseline-sharing group=].
			See [[#align-by-baseline]] for more details.

			The <a>fallback alignment</a> for ''first baseline'' is ''start''.

		<dt><dfn lt="last baseline | last">last baseline</dfn>
		<dd>
			Specifies participation in <dfn dfn for export>last-baseline alignment</dfn>:
			aligns the <a>alignment baseline</a> of the box's <a>last baseline set</a>
			with the corresponding baseline
			of its [=baseline-sharing group=].̣
			See [[#align-by-baseline]] for more details.

			The <a>fallback alignment</a> for ''last baseline'' is ''end''.
	</dl>

	When specified for 'align-content',
	these values trigger <a>baseline content-alignment</a>,
	shifting the content of the box within its content box,
	and may also affect the sizing of the box itself.
	See [[#baseline-align-content]].

	When specified for 'align-self'/'justify-self',
	these values trigger <a>baseline self-alignment</a>,
	shifting the entire box within its container,
	which may affect the sizing of its container.
	See [[#baseline-align-self]].

	If both <a>baseline content-alignment</a> <em>and</em> <a>baseline self-alignment</a> are specified in the same axis on the same box,
	only <a>baseline self-alignment</a> is honored in that axis;
	the content-alignment in that axis must be treated as ''start''.

	<p class='issue'>Add example images here.

	If a box does not belong to a <a>shared alignment context</a>,
	then the <a>fallback alignment</a> is used.
	For example, ''align-content: baseline'' on a block box
	falls back to ''align-content/start'' alignment.
	The [=fallback alignment=] is also used to align the [=baseline-sharing group=]
	within its [=alignment container=].

    Note: Because they are equivalent, and ''baseline'' is shorter,
	the CSSOM serializes ''first baseline'' as ''baseline''.

	Note: For the somewhat-related 'vertical-align' property,
	due to inconsistent design decisions in CSS2.1,
	''baseline'' is not equivalent to ''first baseline''
	as an inline-level box’s <a>baseline alignment preference</a> depends on 'display'.
	(E.g., ''inline-block'' uses its last baseline by default,
	while ''inline-table'' uses its first baseline by default.)

<h3 id='distribution-values'>
Distributed Alignment: the ''<content-distribution>/stretch'', ''space-between'', ''space-around'', and ''space-evenly'' keywords</h3>

<h3 id='overflow-values'>
Overflow Alignment: the ''safe'' and ''unsafe'' keywords and scroll safety limits</h3>

	When the <a>alignment subject</a> is larger than the <a>alignment container</a>,
	it will overflow.
	Some alignment modes, if honored in this situation,
	may cause data loss:
	for example, if the contents of a sidebar are centered,
	when they overflow they may send part of their boxes past the viewport's start edge,
	which can't be scrolled to.

	To control this situation,
	an <dfn export>overflow alignment</dfn> mode can be explicitly specified.
	“Unsafe” alignment honors the specified alignment mode in overflow situations, even if it causes data loss,
	while “safe” alignment changes the alignment mode in overflow situations in an attempt to avoid data loss.
	The default behavior is to contain the alignment subject within the scrollable area,
	though at the time of writing this safety feature is not yet implemented.

	<pre class='prod'><dfn>&lt;overflow-position></dfn> = unsafe | safe</pre>

	<dl dfn-type="value" dfn-for="<overflow-position>">
		<dt><dfn>safe</dfn>
		<dd>
			If the size of the <a>alignment subject</a> overflows the <a>alignment container</a>,
			the <a>alignment subject</a> is instead aligned as if the alignment mode were ''start''.

		<dt><dfn>unsafe</dfn>
		<dd>
			Regardless of the relative sizes of the <a>alignment subject</a> and <a>alignment container</a>,
			the given alignment value is honored.

		<dt>(no value specified)
		<dd>
			If the <a>overflow alignment</a> isn't explicitly specified,
			the default <a>overflow alignment</a> is a blend of "safe" and "unsafe"
			in that an overflowing <a>alignment subject</a> is allowed to overflow its <a>alignment container</a>,
			but if this would cause it to also overflow
			the <a>scrollable overflow region</a> of its nearest ancestor <a>scroll container</a>
			(thus extending into the "unscrollable" region),
			then its overflow in that direction is limited
			by biasing any remaining overflow to the opposite side.

			Issue: It may not be Web-compatible to implement the “smart” default behavior
			(though we hope so, and believe it to be likely),

The 'justify-content' And 'align-content' Properties</h3>

	The <dfn export>content-distribution properties</dfn> 'align-content' and 'justify-content'
	(and their 'place-content' shorthand)

	<div class="figure">
		<img alt="Diagram showing that the alignment of the content within the element is affected." src="images/content-example.svg" width=212 height=212>
	</div>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: align-content
	Value: normal | <<baseline-position>> |  <<content-distribution>> | <<overflow-position>>? <<content-position>>
	Initial: normal
	Applies to: block containers, multicol containers, flex containers, and grid containers

	or the block/column/cross axis of the box (for 'align-content').
	Values other than <dfn value for="justify-content, align-content">normal</dfn> are defined in [[#alignment-values]], above.

	For all layout modes,
	the <a>alignment subject</a> and <a>alignment container</a>
	both assume the <a>writing mode</a> of the box the '*-content' property is set on.

### Block Containers (Including Table Cells)### {#distribution-block}

	<table class="data align-details">
		<tr>
			<th><a>Alignment Container</a>
			<td>
				The <a>block container</a>’s content box.
		<tr>
			<th><a lt="alignment subject">Alignment Subject(s)</a>

				The entire contents of the block, as a unit.

				''vertical-align/top'' makes it behave as ''start'',
				''vertical-align/middle'' makes it behave as ''center'',
				''vertical-align/bottom'' makes it behave as ''end'',
				and all other values make it behave as ''baseline''.
				[[!CSS2]]

				In the case of multi-column elements with a non-''column-width/auto'' 'column-width',
				'justify-content' values other than ''justify-content/normal'' or ''justify-content/stretch''
				cause the columns to take their specified 'column-width'
				rather than stretching to fill the container.
				The column boxes are then aligned as specified by 'justify-content'.

### Flex Containers ### {#distribution-flex}

	<table class="data align-details">

<h3 id='place-content'>
Content-Distribution Shorthand: the 'place-content' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">

	Initial: normal
	Applies to: block containers, flex containers, and grid containers
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: n/a
	Media: visual
	Computed value: see individual properties
	Animatable: no
	</pre>

	This <a>shorthand property</a> sets both the 'align-content' and 'justify-content' properties in one declaration.
	The first value is assigned to 'align-content'.
	The second value is assigned to 'justify-content';
	if omitted, it is copied from the first value,
	unless that value is a <<baseline-position>>
	in which case it is defaulted to ''start''.

<h3 id="overflow-scroll-position">
Overflow and Scroll Positions</h3>

	The <a>content-distribution properties</a> also affect the initial scroll position,

	Additionally, so that the content remains in the <a>scrollable overflow region</a> in order to be scrollable,
	the ''overflow/scroll'' and ''overflow/auto'' values of 'overflow'
	trigger ''safe'' content alignment always.

	<div class='example'>
		For example,
		if a scrollable flex container is set to ''justify-content: flex-end''
		(or ''justify-content: flex-start'' with ''flex-flow: row-reverse''),
		it will be initially displayed scrolled all the way to the main-end edge of the scrollable area,
		and its content will appear to overflow its main-start edge.
	</div>

<h3 id="baseline-align-content">
Baseline Content-Alignment</h3>

	The content of boxes participating in row-like layout contexts (<a>shared alignment contexts</a>)
	can be baseline-aligned to each other.
	<dfn export lt="baseline content-alignment|first-baseline content-alignment|last-baseline content-alignment">baseline content-alignment</dfn> effectively increases the <strong>padding</strong> on the box

		<dt>Grid Items:

			For this purpose,
			the ''start'', ''end'', ''flex-start'', and ''flex-end'' values of 'align-self'

The 'gap' property,

	separating boxes in the container's <a>inline axis</a>
	similar to <a>inline-axis</a> margin;
	while 'row-gap' indicates spacing between “rows”,
	separating boxes in the container's <a>block axis</a>.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="row-gap, column-gap, gap">
		: <<length-percentage>>
		::
			Specifies a gap between “rows” or “columns”,
			as defined by the layout modes to which it applies;
			see subsections below for details.

			Negative values are invalid.
			Percentages resolve to zero
			when specified against a content-based size
			(such as the <a>logical width</a> of a float
			or the ''height/auto'' <a>logical height</a>
			of a <a>block-level</a> <a>grid container</a>).

		: <dfn>normal</dfn>
		:: The ''gap/normal'' represents a UA-dependent length on <a>multi-column elements</a>,
			and computes to ''0px'' in all other contexts.

			Issue: Should ''gap/normal'' just compute to ''1em'' in multicol?
	</dl>

	Gutters effect a minimum spacing between items:
	additional spacing may be added by 'justify-content'/'align-content'.
	Such additional space effectively increases the size of these <a>gutters</a>.

	The exact handling of these properties varies by layout container:

	<dl>
		<dt id="gap-multicol"><a>multi-column elements</a>
		<dd>
			'column-gap' specifes the [=gutter=] between adjacent <a>column boxes</a>.
			See [[CSS-MULTICOL-1]] for details on how this affects the layout of multicol elements.
			'row-gap' does not currently apply.

		<dt id="gap-flex"><a>flex containers</a>
		<dd>
			When applied to the <a>main axis</a>
			(e.g. 'column-gap' in a ''flex-flow/row'' <a>flex container</a>),
			indicates minimum spacing between items,
			as if a fixed-size margin were inserted between adjacent <a>flex items</a>
			in a single line.

			When applied to the <a>cross axis</a>
			(e.g. 'row-gap' in a ''flex-flow/row'' <a>flex container</a>),
			indicates minimum spacing between adjacent <a>flex lines</a>.

		<dt id="gap-grid"><a>grid containers</a>
		<dd>
			The 'row-gap' and 'column-gap' properties,
			when specified on a <a>grid container</a>,
			define the [=gutters=] between <a>grid rows</a> and <a>grid columns</a>,
			respectively.
			See [[css-grid-1#gutters]] for precise details.
	</dl>

	Note: Table boxes do not use the 'gap' properties
	to specify separation between their cells.
	Instead, they use the 'border-spacing' property,
	which has slightly different functionality:
	it inherits,
	and it also specifies the additional spacing between the outermost cells
	and the border of the table
	(similar to ''space-evenly'' rather than ''space-between'').

<h3 id='gap-shorthand'>
Gap Shorthand: the 'gap' property</h3>

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: gap
	Value: <<'row-gap'>> <<'column-gap'>>?
	Initial: see individual properties
	Applies to: <a>multi-column elements</a>, <a>flex containers</a>, <a>grid containers</a>
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: refer to corresponding dimension of the content area
	Media: visual
	Computed value: see individual properties
	Animatable: as length, percentage, or calc
	</pre>

	This property is a <a>shorthand</a> that sets 'row-gap' and 'column-gap' in one declaration.
	If <<'column-gap'>> is omitted,
	it's set to the same value as <<'row-gap'>>.

	<div class='example'>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/gutters-gaps.svg" alt="A diagram showing how margins and padding add to the visible gutter size" width="500" height="616">
		</figure>

		Note: The 'gap' property is only one component of the visible “gutter” or “alley” created between boxes.
		Margins, padding, or the use of distributed alignment
		may increase the visible separation between boxes
		beyond what is specified in 'gap'.
	</div>

<h3 id='gap-legacy'>
Legacy Gap Properties: the 'grid-row-gap', 'grid-column-gap', and 'grid-gap' properties</h3>

	The Grid Layout module was originally written with its own set of [=gutter=] properties,
	before all such properties were unified into the existing 'row-gap'/'column-gap' naming.
	For compatibility with legacy content,
	those legacy property names must be supported as aliases:

	* <dfn property>grid-row-gap</dfn> must be treated as a shorthand for the 'row-gap' property
	* <dfn property>grid-column-gap</dfn> must be treated as a shorthand for the 'column-gap' property
	* <dfn property>grid-gap</dfn> must be treated as a shorthand for the 'gap' property

	In all three cases, the legacy properties must take the same grammar as the property they are aliasing,
	and just "forward" the value to their aliased property.

<h2 id='baseline-rules'>
Baseline Alignment Details</h2>

	Boxes in a <a>baseline-sharing group</a> are aligned to each other
	using their <a>alignment baselines</a>.
	For example, in horizontal writing modes,
	specifying ''align-content: baseline'' on table cells in the same row
	will align the baselines of their <a>first formatted lines</a>.
	This section defines exactly how baseline alignment is performed
	in consideration of the myriad baselines and <a>writing modes</a>
	that exist in internationalized modern CSS.

	A <dfn export>baseline set</dfn> is
	a set of baselines (alphabetic, central, etc.)
	associated with a common baseline table.
	Typically, a typesetting tradition will use only one of these,
	but different writing systems use different baselines,
	and mixing writing systems can result in using more than one
	within a single line.
	Refer to [[css-writing-modes-3#intro-baselines]]
	for more information on baselines and writing modes.

<h3 id='baseline-export'>
Determining the Baselines of a Box</h2>

	Each box,
	for a given axis,
	has a <dfn export lt="first baseline set|first baselines">first baseline set</dfn>
	(and <dfn export lt="last baseline set|last baselines">last baseline set</dfn>)
	that nominally corresponds to the <a>baseline set</a> of
	the first (last) line of text within the box.
	The <dfn export>alignment baseline</dfn> is one of these,
	usually the dominant baseline associated with the <a>shared alignment context</a>.
	(See the 'dominant-baseline' and 'alignment-baseline' properties in [[CSS-INLINE-3]].)

	The first and last <a>baseline sets</a> of a box
	are determined differently based on the layout model, as follows:

	<dl>
		<dt>block containers
		<dd>
			The first (last) [=baseline set=] of a block container
			is <a>generated</a> from the dominant first (last) baseline
			of the first (last) in-flow line box in the block container,
			or is taken from the first (last) in-flow block-level child in the block container
			that contributes a set of first (last) baselines,
			whichever comes first (last).
			If there is no such line box or child,
			then the block container has no [=baseline set=].

		<dt>tables
		<dd>
			The first (last) [=baseline set=] of a table box
			is the first (last) [=baseline set=] of its first (last) row.

			When finding the first (last) baseline set of an inline-block,
			any baselines contributed by table boxes must be skipped.
			(This quirk is a legacy behavior from [[CSS2]].)

		<dt>table rows
		<dd>
			If any cells in the row participate in ''first baseline'' (''last baseline'') alignment along the row axis,
			the first (last) [=baseline set=] of the row
			is <a>generated</a> from their shared <a>alignment baseline</a>
			and the row's <a>first available font</a>,
			after alignment has been performed.
			Otherwise, the first (last) [=baseline set=] of the row
			is <a>synthesized</a> from the lowest and highest content edges of the cells in the row.
			[[!CSS2]]

		<dt>flex containers
		<dd>
			See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/#flex-baselines">Flex Baselines</a> in [[!CSS-FLEXBOX-1]].

		<dt>grid containers
		<dd>
			See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid-layout/#grid-baselines">Grid Baselines</a> in [[!CSS-GRID-1]].
	</dl>

	To <dfn local-lt=generate|generated export>generate baselines</dfn> for a box from a single baseline,
	use the baseline table from the font settings and <a>first available font</a> of that box,
	and align that baseline set to the given single baseline.

	To <dfn lt="synthesize baseline|synthesized baseline" local-lt=synthesize|synthesized export>synthesize baselines</dfn> from a rectangle (or two parallel lines),
	synthesize the alphabetic baseline from the <a>line-under</a> line,
	and the central baseline by averaging the positions of the two edges or lines.
	See [[css-inline-3#baseline-synthesis]] for rules on synthesizing additional baselines.

	Note: The edges used to <a>synthesize</a> baselines from a box
	depend on their <a>formatting context</a>:
	inline-level boxes <a>synthesize</a> from their margin edges [[CSS-INLINE-3]],
	table cells <a>synthesize</a> from their content edges [[CSS2]],
	and grid and flex items <a>synthesize</a> from their border edges [[CSS-GRID-1]] [[CSS-FLEXBOX-1]].

	In general, the <a>writing mode</a> of the box, shape, or other object being aligned
	is used to determine the <a>line-under</a> and <a>line-over</a> edges for synthesis.
	However, when that <a>writing mode</a>’s
	<a>block flow direction</a> is parallel
	to the axis of the <a>alignment context</a>,
	an axis-compatible <a>writing mode</a> must be assumed:
	* If the box establishing the <a>alignment context</a>
		has a <a>block flow direction</a> that is orthogonal to the axis of the <a>alignment context</a>,
		use its <a>writing mode</a>.
	* Otherwise, assume either ''horizontal-tb'' or ''vertical-lr'' 'writing-mode',
		whichever is orthogonal to the box’s own 'writing-mode'.
		<!-- This pairing is chosen because the most likely case for this situation is CJK. -->

	For the purposes of finding the baselines of a box,
	it and all its in-flow descendants with a scrolling mechanism (see the 'overflow' property)
	must be considered as if scrolled to their origin.
	Furthermore, if, in the case of a box with non-''visible'' overflow,
	the resulting position of a first (last) baseline
	is past a box's end (start) border edge,
	its position is clamped to that border edge.

<h3 id='baseline-terms'>
Baseline Alignment Grouping</h3>

	A <dfn export>baseline-sharing group</dfn>
	is composed of boxes that participate in baseline alignment together.
	This is possible only if they

	<ul>
		<li>Share an <a>alignment context</a> along an axis perpendicular to the axis they're being baseline-aligned in.
			(For example, grid items with ''align-self: baseline'' are baseline-aligning along the grid’s block axis,
			and therefore participate with other items in their row.)
		<li>Have <a>compatible baseline alignment preferences</a>
			(i.e., the baselines that want to align are on the same side of the alignment context).
	</ul>

	Boxes share an <dfn lt="shared alignment context|alignment context" export>alignment context</dfn>,
	along a particular axis,
	and established by a particular box,
	when they are:

	<ul>
		<li>table cells in the same row, along the table's row (inline) axis, established by the row box
		<!--baseline-align-column <li>table cells in the same column, along the table's column (block) axis, established by the column box -->
		<li>grid items in the same row, along the grid's row (inline) axis, established by the <a>grid container</a>
		<li>grid items in the same column, along the grid's column (block) axis, established by the <a>grid container</a>
		<li>flex items in the same flex line, along the flex container's main axis, established by the <a>flex container</a>
	</ul>

	Note: Conceptually,
	the inline-level boxes in a line box also share a self-alignment context
	and participate in a baseline-sharing group;
	however they only baseline-align in response to the 'vertical-align' property,
	not any of the properties defined in this module.
	See [[CSS-INLINE-3]].

	If a box spans multiple <a>shared alignment contexts</a>,
	then it participates in first (last) baseline alignment
	within its start-most (end-most) <a>shared alignment context</a> along that axis.
	For example, a table cell spanning three rows
	participates in <a>first-baseline alignment</a>
	with the table cells in the first row that it spans,
	or alternatively in <a>last-baseline alignment</a>
	with the table cells in the last row that it spans.

	The <a>baseline alignment preferences</a> of two boxes in a <a>baseline-sharing group</a> are <dfn lt="compatible baseline alignment preferences">compatible</dfn> if they have:

	* the same <a>block flow direction</a> and <a>baseline alignment preference</a>
	* opposite <a>block flow direction</a> and opposite <a>baseline alignment preference</a>

<h3 id='align-by-baseline'>
Aligning Boxes by Baseline</h3>

	Given a set of [=alignment subjects=] and their baselines
	that all belong to a single <a>baseline-sharing group</a>,
	the [=alignment subjects=] are baseline-aligned as follows:

	First, generate the <a>baseline-sharing group</a>’s baseline table
	from the <a>first available font</a> of the group’s [=alignment context=]
	and overlay also the mirror of this baseline table by aligning their central baselines.
	These are the baseline “grids” to which the [=alignment subjects=] will align.

	Next, align each [=alignment subject=] by its specified <a>alignment baseline</a>
	to the group’s baseline table
	or its mirror, whichever matches the [=alignment subject’s=] <a>line orientation</a>.
	Unless otherwise specified (e.g. via the 'alignment-baseline' property),
	the <a>alignment baseline</a> is the <a>dominant baseline</a> of the [=alignment context=].

	Position the aligned <a>baseline-sharing group</a> within the [=alignment container=]
	according to the <a>fallback alignment</a> associated with the
	specified <a>baseline alignment preference</a>.
	For first (last) <a>baseline content-alignment</a>,
	then add the minimum necessary extra space
	between the [=alignment container’s=] start (end) content edge
	and the [=alignment subject’s=] edge
	to align the start (end) margin edges of all the [=alignment containers=]
	in the [=alignment context=]
	while maintaining baseline alignment within the [=baseline-sharing group=].
