<h1>Disposition of comments for Media Queries CR</h1>

<p>This document is a proposed disposition of comments on the Media Queries CR sent to the www-style mailing list. The Media Queries CR was first published <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-css3-mediaqueries-20020708/">8 July 2002</a>, with an editorial revision published <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/CR-css3-mediaqueries-20070606/">6 June 2007</a>.

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/css3-updates/css3-mediaqueries-comments">Disposition of comments at last call.</a>

<p>The following color coding convention is used for comments after the 6 June 2007 publication:</p>

<ul>
 <li class=a>The CSS WG agreed with the reviewer.
 <li class=r>The CSS WG disagreed with the reviewer.
 <li class=fo>The CSS WG disagreed with the reviewer and the reviewer raised a Formal Objection.

<tr><td>1<td>
Given the W3C has already developed a framework (CC/PP) for
describing device capabilities (to be used by a server to
generate appropriate content), why did the CSS WG ignore this 
work and develop yet another, competing solution?

<td>
Media Queries are different in several
respects. First, the communication goes the other way and the client
(rather than the server) makes the decision on what style sheet to
use. The CSS WG thinks there is room for both a client-based and a server-based
solution. Second, the work on Media Queries is continued from HTML4
where section 6.13 sketches a solution very close to Media
Queries. So, the solution was developed before the work on CC/PP
started and should not be interpreted as hostile to CC/PP.

<tr><td>3<td>The specification does not seem to address exactly how aspect 
ratios should be queried. The spec seems to assert/dictate that pixel 
height divided by pixel width provides the correct device aspect ratio. For some devices, one cannot assume that pixel-height/pixel-width provides 
the correct aspect ratio.

<tr><td>x<td>

<p>Section 4.1.5 says "A CSS user agent that encounters  
an unrecognized at-rule must ignore the whole of the at-rule and continue  
parsing after it." I have to agree with Christian and Jukka on the lack of  
precision here ... I'd like to see the following three actions:-

<p>1) A rewording of CSS2.1 Section 4.1.5 to address this point so that it is  
clear that the error behavior of the above case is to ignore the entire  
rule, i.e. apply it to no media types. It should also be made clear that  
this error behavior applies if a single (apparent) media type is  
unrecognised [or, indeed, all of several], e.g.

<pre>
@media printt { ... }
</pre>

<p>or is invalid (to give a CSS3 Media Queries example):-

<pre>
@media screen (device-width < 640px) { ... }
</pre>

<p>Practically, this will cover typos and also (future) misunderstandings by  
authors of media queries. The reworded material might better be  
transferred to Section 4.2. I think the original case of a completely  
missing media type is the most important since it more probably might be  
construed that the rule should then be applied to all media.

<p>2) An addition to CSS2.1 Section 7.2.1 to repeat what the formal grammar  
at Appendix G says: that at least one media type must be present (for the  
benefit of developers who are unlikely to read and understand the  
Appendix).

<p>3) Corresponding changes to the appropriate CSS3 modules.

<p>I would like to be sure that this issue is accepted by the editors of  
CSS2.1 and CSS3 and will be closed out in due course. I'm assuming that  
that's the function of this list and consistent with W3C's methods for  
developing Recommendations. Can one of the editors acknowledge please?

<tr><td>4<td>
Regarding CSS 3 Media Queries (CR 2002-07-08), I would like to propose an  
additional "media feature" to describe whether or what kind of images are  
supported:

<pre>
   images (or image)
   Value: none | bitmap | vector | all
   Applies to: visual media types
   Accepts min/max prefixes: no
</pre>

<td>It is an interesting idea to add queries on what features a UA
supports. One could, for example, also add media queries to check
whether a UA supports multi-column layout or CSS3 selectors. This may
become the topic of a future specification, but the CSS WG do not want
to address this big task in a relatively stable draft. Also, it should
be pointed out that UAs have a history of falsifying their identity to
make sure they receive all content.

<tr><td>5<td>
Where in CSS3 is defined that @page is allowed in @media as in:

<pre>
@media print{
  @page{
    margin:2cm;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>I couldn't find it anywhere and I guess it should have been defined in CSS 3
media queries which points to CSS 2.1 (or 2.0, actually) which I believe
forbids it. However, the CSS 3 paged media module gives some examples of it
which make it same like it is allowed. (And it would make sense.)

<td>The expectation is that other modules will define this.

<tr class=a><td>6<td>I was wondering why a negative &lt;length> for 'width' (and other media features)
is not disallowed ... I hope a further revision of the specification could say that "&lt;length> must be
a positive integer when applied to a media feature specified in this
specification." (Perhaps adding "or zero" to that for clarity if needed.)

<td>
With my editor's hat on I went through all the features and clarified what type of "numbers" they could hold and whether those could be negative, zero, or just positive.


<tr><th colspan=3 class=source><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2005Dec/0091.html">Comment</a> from Simon Pieters Fri, 16 Dec 2005.

<tr><td>7<td>
I think that if @media has an empty list of media queries, it should be 
equivalent to "all". So the following at-rules all have the media query 
"all":

<pre>
@media {}
@media all {}
@media "foo" {}
@media all "foo" {}
</pre>

<p>What should happen when the name is the empty string? I guess it should 
work the same way as &lt;link rel=stylesheet title=""> in HTML. In Mozilla and 
Opera, the empty string is equivalent to no name at all (or the other way 
around, no name is equivalent to the empty string). Thus, I think the 
following should be equivalent:

<pre>
@media all {}
@media all "" {}
</pre>

<td>We agree that a syntax where 'all' is omitted may be handy. The
revised CR adds a shorthand syntax for media queries that apply to all
media types; the keyword ''all'' can be left out (along with the
trailing ''and''). These two media queries are equivalent:

<pre>
  @media all and (orientation: portrait) { ... }
  @media (orientation: portrait) { ... }
</pre>

<tr><td>8<td>
css3-mediaqueries doesn't seem to define the error handling behavior for
syntactically incorrect media queries.  This needs to be defined so that
it is possible to know which of the following rules should make p
elements green:

<pre>
@media all and (min-width: 1px), all and (min-width: more than 1px) {
  p { color: green }
}

@media all and (min-width: 1px), all and (unknown-feature: 3px) {
  p { color: green }
}

@media all and (min-width: 1px), all and (min-width: 1unknownunit) {
  p { color: green }
}

@media all and (min-width: 1px), all and ((< min-width 200px)) {
  p { color: green }
}

@media all and (min-width: 1px), all and (width at least 200px) {
  p { color: green }
}
</pre>

<p>Section 5 does say this:

<blockquote>
Since "max-weight" is an unknown media feature, the Media Query is
false and the associated style sheet will not be applied.
</blockquote>

<p>But it doesn't say how unknown media features are parsed.  Is anything
unknown within matched parentheses accepted, but considered always
false?

<td>
<p>This is now clarified in the new error handling section.

<th colspan=3 class=source><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2006Aug/0204.html">Comment</a> from Christoph PÃ¤per on 22 Aug 2006.

<tr><td>11<td>CSS3 Media Queries CR introduces two new units (7.), |dpi| and | 
dpcm|, solely for its |resolution| media feature (6.9.). Could this  
be changed or at least be amended to also allow standard CSS absolute  
length units (e.g. |mm|)? The values using |in| and |cm| would of  
course be the respective reciprocals of the current ones and  
described the size of one pointW pixel. If a new unit was needed at  
all this would be |um|, the ASCII representation of 'Âµm' for  
micrometre, approved by ISO (31?).

<td>The 'dpi' unit is most commonly used to describe resolution, and
'dpcm' provides a SI-based alternative. Adding even more units to
describe resolution seems excessive at this point.


<tr><td>12<td>It might also be a good idea to make this media feature a shorthand  
for horizontal and vertical resolution for which separate features  
might be added later.

<td>The WG has decided to handle differences in vertical and horizontal resolution as described in comment #3.


<tr><th colspan=3 class=source><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2007Jan/0068.html">Comment</a> from Anne van Kesteren on Mon, 15 Jan 2007.

<tr class=a><td>13<td>
<p>Parsing media queries

<p>In HTML4 it was pretty clear. You first split on the "," and then remove  
all characters after the first non ASCII-letter, hyhen or digit. The  
resulting values are the media specified.

<p>For Media Queries it's not clear what rules you have to follow when the  
media query given (after splitting on ",") doesn't match the syntax. It's  
important to know this for the CSSOM MediaList interface for instance.

<p><em>After reading the reply to comment #8, Anne writes: Ah ok, I guess
that sort of solves it. It does mean though that "not all and
(foobar)" would apply. Is that desirable? I was thinking that such a
media query should perhaps simply be ignored completely so we don't
have to worry about how to represent it in the DOM either. That seems
also more in line with error handling in CSS.</em>

This is now addressed by the revised syntax section.

Allow whitespace around '/' for the aspect-ratio and device-aspect-ratio media features.

<td>Agreed.

<tr class=a><td>35<td>
<pre>http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-mediaqueries/#media1 says:
  # For a media feature feature, (feature) will evaluate to true if
  # (feature:x) will evaluate to true for a value x other than zero.
 
Does this mean:
 
  (a) (width) is always true, even if the viewport width is zero,
  because "0px" is a value other than zero, or:
 
  (b) (width) is false when the viewport width is zero because "0px"
  and "0" are both not "other than zero"?
 
I'd also note that because specified widths cannot be negative,
(max-width) currently behaves the same as (width), whereas
(min-width) is always true.  Is that really intended?</pre>

<td>Zero is clarified to mean 0px, 0, etc. <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Sep/0002.html">Min/max prefixed media features without values cannot be used</a>.

<pre>After reading http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-mediaqueries/#grid it's
not clear to me whether the queries "(grid: -1)" or "(grid: 2)"
should be parse errors or should always be false.  It should be
clear.</pre>

<tr class=r><td>37<td>The request is changing the syntax of aspect-ratio and
device-aspect-ratio to floats and orientation to angles.
<td>The WG decided to not make a change here. The WG also decided to keep aspect-ratio and device-aspect-ratio and not drop them as suggested in the follow-up thread.
