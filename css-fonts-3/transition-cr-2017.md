[Minutes, Telcon 2018-03-07](https://www.w3.org/2018/03/07-css-minutes.html#item02)

## Changes

[Changes from the July 2013 CSS3 Fonts Last Call Working Draft](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-3/#recent-changes)

## Requirements satisfied

There is no specific requirements document for this specification. The work
is within the scope defined in the CSS WG's charter,

## Dependencies met (or not)

There are no normative references which are not yet at CR or above.

## Wide Review

See the Disposition of comments.

There has now been additional implementation feedback from multiple browsers.
All current feedback has been addressed and collected in the latest Disposition
of Comments, so we would like to publish a new CR.

## Issues addressed

The [Disposition of Comments](https://drafts.csswg.org/issues?spec=css-fonts-3&doc=cr-2017) shows 37 issues. Of those 2 are still open; 18 were accepted, 9 deferred to Fonts 4, 3 were invalid or duplicates, one was withdrawn and 4 were rejected (three because we can't change this due to web compatibility, and one because it is fixed in Fonts 4).

Despite there being a couple of open issues, it has been a very long time since the /TR version of the spec was updated (2013) and we want to publish an update while we work on the remaining issues.

## Formal Objections

None

## Implementation

[Test suite](https://test.csswg.org/harness/suite/css-fonts-3_dev/)

The [implementation report](https://test.csswg.org/harness/results/css-fonts-3_dev/grouped/) shows that
464 of 473 required tests meet CR exit criteria. Most of the 9 failing tests relate to a feature which we have marked as at-risk and expect to move to Fonts 4.

## Patent disclosures
