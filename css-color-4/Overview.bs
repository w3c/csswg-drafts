<h2 id="introduction">
Introduction</h2>

	<em>This section is not normative.</em>

	This module describes CSS properties which
	allow authors to specify
	the foreground color and opacity of the text content of an element.
	This module also describes in detail the CSS <<color>> value type.


	It not only defines the color-related properties and values that
	already exist in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1">CSS1</a>, <a
	href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/">CSS2</a>,
	and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/">CSS Color 3</a>,
	but also defines new properties and values.

	In particular, it allows specifying colors
	in other [=colorspaces=] than sRGB;
	previously, the more saturated colors outside the sRGB gamut
	could not be used in CSS
	even if the display device supported them.
	In addition to the family of
	<abbr title="red-green-blue">RGB</abbr> colorspaces,
	[=colorspaces=] with other primaries
	such as <abbr title="cyan-magenta-yellow-black">CMYK</abbr> or
	<abbr title="black-cyan-magenta-yellow-green-orange-violet">KCMYGOV</abbr>
	are supported.

	A <a href="https://test.csswg.org/harness/results/css-color-4_dev/grouped/">draft implementation report</a> is available.

<h3 id="values">
Value Definitions</h3>

	This specification follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]]
	using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs">value definition syntax</a> from [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values &amp; Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification
	also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> as their property value.
	For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

<h2 id="terminology">Color terminology</h2>

	A <dfn export>color</dfn> is a definition (numeric or textual)
	of the human visual perception of a light
	or a physical object illuminated with light.
	The objective study of human color perception is termed
	<abbr title="colorimetry is the measurement of human color perception">colorimetry</abbr>.
	If two objects have different
	<abbr title="the amount of light at each wavelength">spectra</abbr>,
	but produce the same physical sensation,
	we say they have the same color.

	<div class="example" id="ex-cal-leaf">For example a green leaf, a photograph of that leaf
		displayed on a computer screen, and a print of that photograph,
		are all producing a green sensation by different means.
		If the screen and the printer are [=calibrated=],
		the green in the leaf, and the photo, and the print will look the same.
	</div>

	A <dfn export>colorspace</dfn> is an organization of colors
	with respect to an underlying
	<abbr title="colorimetry is the measurement of human color perception">colorimetric</abbr>
	model,
	such that there is a clear, objectively-measurable meaning
	for any color in that colorspace.
	This also means that the same color can be expressed in multiple colorspaces,
	or transformed from one colorspace to another,
	while looking the same.

	<div class="example" id="ex-leaf-spectro"><p>A leaf is measured
		with a spectrophotometer
		and found to have the color
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(41.587%, 50.3670%, 36.664%)"></span> lch(51.2345% 21.2 130)
		which is
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(41.587%, 50.3670%, 36.664%)"></span> lab(51.2345% -13.6271 16.2401).</p>

		<p>This same color could be expressed in various colorspaces:</p>

		<pre class="lang-css">
<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(41.587%, 50.3670%, 36.664%)"></span> color(sRGB 0.41587 0.503670 0.36664);
<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(41.587%, 50.3670%, 36.664%)"></span> color(display-p3 0.43313 0.50108 0.37950);
<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(41.587%, 50.3670%, 36.664%)"></span> color(a98-rgb 0.44091 0.49971 0.37408);
<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(41.587%, 50.3670%, 36.664%)"></span> color(prophoto-rgb 0.36589 0.41717 0.31333);
<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(41.587%, 50.3670%, 36.664%)"></span> color(rec2020 0.42210 0.47580 0.35605);
		</pre>

	</div>

	An <dfn export>additive colorspace</dfn>
	means that the coordinate system is linear in light intensity.
	The <abbr title="International Commission on Illumination, = Commission internationale de l'éclairage (in French)">CIE</abbr>
	XYZ colorspace is an additive colorspace
	(in addition, the Y component of XYZ is the
	<abbr title="the intensity per unit area, or 'how bright it is'">luminance</abbr>).

	In an additive colorspace, calculations can be done
	to accurately predict color mixing. Most RGB spaces
	are not additive, because the components are
	<em>gamma encoded</em>. Undoing this gamma encoding
	produces linear-light values.

	<div class="example" id="ex-additivity">
		For example, if a light fixture contains two identical colored lights,
		and only one is switched on,
		and the color is measured to be
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(47.74% 35.59% 21.53%)"></span> color(xyz 0.13 0.12 0.04),
		then the color when both are switched on will be exactly twice that,
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(65.57% 49.35% 30.58%)"></span> color(xyz 0.26 0.24 0.08).

		If we have two differently colored spotlights shining on a stage,
		and one has the measured value
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(0% 60.02% 47.86%)"></span>
		color(xyz 0.15 0.24 0.17)
		while the other is
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(50.45% 9.53% 31.04%)"></span>
		color(xyz 0.11 0.06 0.06)
		then we can accurately predict that if the colored beams are made to overlap,
		the color of the mixture will be the sum
		of the XYZ component values, or
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(75.5% 51.71% 56.61%)"></span>
		color(xyz 0.26 0.30 0.23).
	</div>

	A <dfn export>chromaticity</dfn> is a color measurement
	where the lightness component has been factored out.
	From the idential lights example above,
	the <em>u',v'</em> chromaticity with one light is
	(0.2537, 0.5268)
	and the chromaticity is the same with both lights
	(they are the same color, it is just brighter).

	Chromaticities are additive,
	so they accurately predict
	the chromaticity (but not the resulting lightness)
	of a mixture.
	Being two-dimensional, chromaticity is easily represented
	on a <em>chromaticity diagram</em>
	to predict the chromaticity of a color mixture.
	Any two colors can be mixed, and the resulting colors
	will lie on the line joining them on the diagram.
	Three colors form a plane, and the resulting colors
	will lie in the triangle they form on the diagram.


	When the measured physical characteristics
	(such as the <abbr title="measured color, irrespective of lightness">chromaticities</abbr> of the primary colors it uses,
	or the colors produced in response to a given set of inputs)
	of a [=colorspace=] or a color-producing device are known,
	it is said to be <dfn export>characterized</dfn>.
	This characterization information is stored in a <em>profile</em>.
	The most common type of color profile is defined by the International Color Consortium (ICC) [[!ICC]].

	If in addition adjustments have been made so that a device meets calibration targets
	such as white point, neutrality of greys, predictability and consistency of tone response,
	then it is said to be <dfn export>calibrated</dfn>.

	Real physical devices cannot yet produce every possible color that the human eye can see.
	The range of colors that a given device can produce is termed the <dfn export>gamut</dfn>
	<em>(not to be confused with gamma)</em>.
	Devices with a limited gamut cannot produce very saturated colors,
	like those found in a rainbow.

	The gamuts of different [=colorspace=]s may be compared
	by looking at the volume (in cubic Lab units) of colors that can be expressed.
	The following table examines the <a href="#predefined">predefined</a> colorspaces available in CSS.

<h2 id="the-color-property">
Foreground Color: the 'color' property</h2>

	<pre class=propdef>
	Name: color
	Value: <<color>>
	Initial: CanvasText
	Applies to: all elements and text
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: computed color, see <a href="#resolving-color-values">resolving color values</a>
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	<wpt>
	color-001.html
	color-002.html
	color-003.html
	inheritance.html
	</wpt>

	This property describes the foreground fill color of an element's text content.
	In addition, it provides the value that ''<color>/currentcolor'' resolves to.

	There are several different ways to syntactically specify a given color.

	<div class="example" id="ex-lime">
		For example, to specify the sRGB color lime green:
		<pre class="lang-css">
		em { color: <span class="swatch" style="--color: lime"></span>&nbsp;lime; }   /* color keyword  */
		em { color: <span class="swatch" style="--color: lime"></span>&nbsp;rgb(0 255 0); } /* RGB range 0-255   */
		em { color: <span class="swatch" style="--color: lime"></span>&nbsp;rgb(0% 100% 0%); } /* RGB range 0%-100% */
		em { color: <span class="swatch" style="--color: lime"></span>&nbsp;color(sRGB 0 1 0); } /* sRGB range 0.0-1.0 */
		</pre>
	</div>

	<dl>
		<dt><<color>>
		<dd>The <<color>> type is defined in a later section.
	</dl>

 <p class="note">
 Note: In general, this property, including its alpha component, has
 no effect on "color glyphs", such as emoji in some fonts, which are
 colored by a built-in palette. Some colored fonts are able to refer
 to the foreground color, such as palette entry ''0xFFFF'' in COLR
 table of OpenType, and ''context-fill'' value in SVG-in-OpenType. In
 that case, the foreground color is set by this property, identical
 to how ''<color>/currentcolor'' value works.

<h2 id='color-type'>
Representing Colors: the <<color>> type</h2>

	CSS has several syntaxes for specifying color values.
	Some directly specify an sRGB color by its channels,
	such as the [=hex color notation=] or ''rgb()'' function.
	Others are more human-friendly to write and understand,
	such as the ''hsl()'' and ''lch()'' functions,
	or the long list of [=named colors=].

<h3 id="color-syntax">The <<color>> syntax</h3>

	Colors are represented as a list of components,
	also sometimes called “channels”,
	representing axises in the color space.
	Each channel has a minimum and maximum value,
	and can take any value between those two.
	Additionally, every color is accompanied by
	an <dfn lt="alpha channel | alpha component" export>alpha component</dfn>,
	indicating how transparent it is,
	and thus how much of the backdrop one can see behind the color.

	Colors in CSS are represented by the <dfn export><<color>></dfn> type:

	<pre class='prod'>
	&lt;color> = <<hex-color>> | <<named-color>> | currentcolor | transparent |
	    <<rgb()>> | <<rgba()>> | <<hsl()>> | <<hsla()>> | <<hwb()>> |
	    <<lab()>> | <<lch()>> |
	    <<color()>> | <<device-cmyk()>> |
	    <<system-color>>
	</pre>

	The <dfn export>color-functions</dfn> are <<rgb()>>, <<rgba()>>,
		<<hsl()>>, <<hsla()>>, <<hwb()>>,
		<<lab()>>, <<lch()>>, and
		<<color()>>.

	Of those, <<hsl()>>, <<hsla()>>, <<hwb()>> and <<lch()>>
		are <dfn export>cylindrical polar color</dfn> representations,
		which specify color using a <<hue>> angle,
		a central axis representing lightness
		(black-to-white),
		and a radius representing saturation or chroma
		(how far the color is from a neutral grey).
	The other colorspaces are
		<dfn export>rectangular orthogonal color</dfn> representations,
		which specify color using three
		(or more, in the case of CMYK or CMYKOGV)
		orthogonal component axes.

	<!--  <<device-cmyk()>> does not actually specify a color; it can't be converted to Lab -->

	For easy reference in other specifications,
	<dfn export>opaque black</dfn> is defined as the color <nobr>''rgb(0 0 0 / 100%)''</nobr>;
	<dfn export>transparent black</dfn> is the same color,
	but fully transparent--
	i.e. <nobr>''rgb(0 0 0 / 0%)''</nobr>.

<h3 id="hue-syntax">The <<hue>> syntax</h3>

Hue is represented as an angle of the color circle
(the rainbow, twisted around into a circle, and with purple added between violet and red).

<pre class='prod'>
	<dfn>&lt;hue></dfn> = <<number>> | <<angle>>
</pre>

Because this value is so often given in degrees,
the argument can also be given as a number,
which is interpreted as a number of degrees.

The angles and spacing
corresponding to particular hues
depend on the colorspace.
For example, in HSL and HWB, which use the sRGB colorspace,
sRGB green is 120 degrees.
In LCH, sRGB green is 134.39 degrees,
display-p3 green is 136.01 degrees,
a98-rgb green is 145.97 degrees
and prophoto-rgb green is 141.04 degrees
(because these are all different shades of green).

For colors very close to the neutral axis,
the hue angle becomes indeterminate
(for example, in Lab,
minute changes in near-zero a and b values
give huge changes in LCH hue angle).
<span id="NaN-hue">Therefore, sometimes a hue angle of NaN
(not a number) may be returned.</span>
This impacts, for example,
<a href="#hue-interpolation">hue interpolation</a>.

<h3 id="notes">
Accessibility and Conveying Information By Color</h3>

	Although colors can add significant information to documents
	and make them more readable,
	color by itself should not be the sole means to convey important information.
	Authors should consider the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [[WCAG21]]
	when using color in their documents.

	> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color"><em>1.4.1 Use of Color:</em>
	> Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information,
	> indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element</a>

<h3 id="tagged-images">Color Space of Tagged Images</h3>

	An <dfn export>tagged image</dfn> is an image
	that is explicitly assigned a color profile,
	as defined by the image format.
	This is usually done by including an
	International Color Consortium (ICC) profile [[!ICC]].

	For example JPEG [[JPEG]], PNG [[PNG]] and TIFF [[TIFF]]
	all specify a means to embed an ICC profile.

	Image formats may also use other, equivalent methods, often for brevity.

	For example, PNG specifies a means (the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11sRGB">sRGB chunk</a>)
	to explicitly tag an image as being in the sRGB colorspace,
	without including the sRGB ICC profile.

	Tagged RGB images,
	and tagged images using a transformation of RGB such as YCbCr,
	if the color profile or other identifying information is valid,
	must be treated as being in the specified color space.

	If the color profile or other identifying information is invalid, the image is treated as [=untagged images=]

	For example, when a browser running on a system with a Display P3 monitor
	displays an JPEG image
	tagged as being in the Adobe® RGB (1998) [[!AdobeRGB]]
	colorspace, it must convert the colors
	from Adobe® RGB (1998) to Display P3
	so that they display correctly.
	It must not treat the Adobe® RGB (1998) values
	as if they were Display P3 values, which would produce incorrect colors.

<h3 id='untagged'>
Color Spaces of Untagged Colors</h3>

	Colors specified in HTML,
	and [=untagged images=] must be treated
	as being in the sRGB color space ([[!SRGB]])
	unless otherwise specified.

	An <dfn export>untagged image</dfn> is an image that is not explicitly assigned a color profile, as defined by the image format.

	Note that this rule does not apply to untagged videos, since
	<dfn export>untagged video</dfn> should be presumed to be in an ITU-defined colorspace.
	* At below 720p, it is Recommendation ITU-R BT.601 [[!ITU-R-BT.601]]
	* At 720p, it is SMPTE ST 296 (same colorimetry as 709) [[!SMPTE296]]
	* At 1080p, it is Recommendation ITU-R BT.709 [[!ITU-R-BT.709]]
	* At 4k (UHDTV) and above, it is ITU-R BT.2020 [[!Rec.2020]] for SDR video

<h3 id='resolving-color-values'>
Resolving <<color>> Values</h3>

	Unless otherwise specified for a particular property,
	[=specified value|specified=] colors are resolved to
	<dfn export lt="computed color">[=computed value|computed=] colors</dfn>
	and then further to <dfn export lt="used color">[=used value|used=] colors</dfn> as described below.

	The [=resolved value=] of a <<color>> is its [=used value=].

<h4 id="resolving-sRGB-values">Resolving sRGB values</h4>

	This applies to:

	* [=hex colors=]
	* ''rgb()'' and ''rgba()'' values
	* ''hsl()'' and ''hsla()'' values
	* ''hwb()'' values
	* [=named colors=]

		While the function names and named colors
		are <a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive">ASCII case-insensitive</a>,
		the [=specified value=]
		does not preserve any mixed casing
		and is treated as being all lowercase.

	''transparent'', and
	''currentcolor''.

		Each <<system-color>> keyword computes to itself.
		Its used value is the corresponding color in its color space.

		The computed and used value of ''transparent'' is [=transparent black=].

		The ''currentcolor'' keyword computes to itself.

		In the 'color' property,
		the used value of ''currentcolor'' is the [=inherited value=].
		In any other property,
		its used value is the used value of the 'color' property on the same element.

		Note: This means that if the ''<color>/currentcolor'' value is inherited,
		it’s inherited as a keyword,
		not as the value of the 'color' property,
		so descendants will use their own 'color' property to resolve it.


<h3 id='serializing-color-values'>
	Serializing <<color>> Values</h3>

This section updates and replaces that part of CSS Object Model, section
<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-1/#serializing-css-values"> Serializing CSS Values</a>, which relates to serializing <<color>> values.

In this section, the strings used in the specification and the corresponding characters are as follows.

<table class="data">
	<tr>
		<th>String</th>
		<th>Character</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>" "</td>
		<td>U+0020 SPACE</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>","</td>
		<td>U+002C COMMA</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>"-"</td>
		<td>U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>"."</td>
		<td>U+002E FULL STOP</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>"/"</td>
		<td>U+002F SOLIDUS</td>
	</tr>
</table>

The string "." shall be used as a decimal separator,
regardless of locale,
and there shall be no thousands separator.


<h4 id="serializing-alpha-values">Serializing alpha values</h4>

	This applies to any <<color>> value which can take an optional alpha value.

	If the alpha is exactly 1,
	it is omitted from the serialization;
	an implicit value of 1 (fully opaque) is the default.

	If the alpha is any other value than 1,
	it is explicitly included in the serialization,
	as a <<number>>, not a <<percentage>>.
	The value is expressed in base ten,
	with the "." character as decimal separator.
	The leading zero must not be omitted.
	Trailing zeroes must be omitted.

	<div class="example" id="ex-alpha-trimzero">
		<p>For example, an alpha value of 70%
			will be serialized as the string
			"0.7"
			which has a leading zero before the decimal separator,
			"." as decimal separator
			(even if the current locale would use some other character,
			such as ","),
			and all digits after the "7" would be "0" and are omitted.
		</p>
	</div>

	The precision with which alpha values are retained,
	and thus the number of decimal places in the serialized value,
	is not defined in this specification,
	but must at least be sufficient
	to round-trip integer percentage values.
	Thus, the serialized value must contain
	at least two decimal places
	(unless trailing zeroes have been removed).
	Values must be
	<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#combine-integers">rounded towards +∞</a>, not truncated.

	<div class="example" id="ex-alpha-round">
		<p>For example, an alpha value of 12.3456789%
			could be serialized as the strings
			"0.12" or "0.123" or "0.1234" or "0.12346"
			(rounding the value of 5
			towards +∞
			because the following digit is 6)
			or any longer, rounded serialization of the same form.
		</p>
	</div>


<h4 id="serializing-sRGB-values">Serializing sRGB values</h4>

	The serialized form of the following sRGB values:

	* [=hex colors=]
	* ''rgb()'' and ''rgba()'' values
	* ''hsl()'' and ''hsla()'' values
	* ''hwb()'' values
	* [=named colors=]

	is derived from the [=computed value=] and thus,
	uses either the ''rgb()'' or ''rgba()'' form
	(depending on whether the alpha is exactly 1, or not),
	with lowercase letters for the function name.

	For compatibility, the sRGB component values
	are serialized in <<number>> form, not <<percentage>>).
	Also for compatibility,
	the component values are serialized in base 10,
	with a range of [0-255], regardless of
	the bit depth with which they are stored.

	<a href="#serializing-alpha-values">As noted earlier</a>,
	unitary alpha values are not explicitly serialized.
	Also, for compatibiity, if the alpha is exactly 1,
	the ''rgb()'' form is used,
	with an implicit alpha;
	otherwise, the ''rgba()'' form is used,
	with an explicit alpha value.

	For compatibility,
	the legacy form with comma separators is used;
	exactly one ASCII space follows each comma.
	This includes the comma (not slash) used
	to separate the blue component of ''rgba()''
	from the alpha value.


	<div class="example" id="ex-rgb-ser-int-rgba">
		<p>For example, the serialized value of</p>
		<pre class="lang-css"><span class="swatch" style="--color: rgba(29, 164, 192, 0.95)"></span> rgb(29 164 192 / 95%)</pre>
		<p>is the string "rgba(29, 164, 192, 0.95)"</p>
	</div>

	Note: contrary to CSS Color 3,
	the parameters of the ''rgb()'' function
	are of type <<number>> not <<integer>>.
	Thus, any higher precision than eight bits
	is indicated with a fractional part.

	Trailing fractional zeroes in any component values must be omitted;
	if the fractional part consists of all zeroes,
	the decimal point must also be omitted.
	This means that sRGB colors specified with integer component values
	will serialize with backwards-compatible integer values.

	The precision with which sRGB component values are retained,
	and thus the number of significant figures in the serialized value,
	is not defined in this specification,
	but must at least be sufficient
	to round-trip eight bit values.
	Values must be <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#combine-integers">rounded towards +∞</a>, not truncated.

	Note: authors of scripts which expect
	color values returned from
	<span style="font-family:monospace">getComputedStyle</span>
	to have <<integer>> component values,
	are advised to update them to cope with
	<<number>>.

<div class="example" id="ex-rgb-number">
	<p>
	For example,</p>
	<pre class="lang-css"><span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(57.28% 42.14% 51.46%)"></span> rgb(146.064 107.457 131.223)</pre>

	<p>A conformant serialized form for both,
	is the string "rgb(146.06, 107.46, 131.2)".</p>
</div>

<div class="example" id="ex-rgb-notrail">
	<p>The serialized value of </p>
	<pre class="lang-css"><span class="swatch" style="--color: goldenrod"></span> ''goldenrod''</pre>

	and not the string "rgb(218.000, 165.000, 32.000)"</p>
</div>

<h4 id="serializing-lab-lch">Serializing Lab and LCH values</h4>

	The serialized form of ''lch()'' and ''lab()'' values
	is derived from the [=computed value=]
	and uses the ''lab()'' or ''lch()'' forms,
	with lowercase letters for the function name.

	The component values are serialized in base 10;
	the Lightness component is serialized as
	<<percentage>>, while the a and b component values
	are serialized as <<number>>.
	A single ASCII space character " "
	must be used as the separator
	between the component values.

	Trailing fractional zeroes in any component values must be omitted;
	if the fractional part consists of all zeroes,
	the decimal point must also be omitted.

	<div class="example" id="ex-lab-zero-a">
		<p>The serialized value of</p>
		<pre class="lang-css"><span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(60.7% 52.23% 0%)"></span> lab(56.200% 0.000 83.600)</pre>
		<p>is the string "lab(56.2% 0 83.6)"</p>
	</div>

	<div class="example" id="ex-lch-serial">
		<p>The serialized value of</p>
		<pre class="lang-css"><span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(41.66% 15.34% 90.66%)"></span> lch(37% 105.0 305.00)</pre>
		<p>is the string "lch(37% 105 305)",
			not "lch(37% 105.0 305.00)".
	</div>

	The precision with which ''lab()'' component values are retained,
	and thus the number of significant figures in the serialized value,
	is not defined in this specification,
	but due to the wide gamut must be sufficient
	to round-trip L values between 0 and 100,
	and a and b values between ±127,
	with at least sixteen bit precision;
	this will result in at least three decimal places
	unless trailing zeroes have been omitted.
	(half float or float, is recommended for internal storage).
	Values must be <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#combine-integers">rounded towards +∞</a>, not truncated.

	Note: a and b values outside ±127 are possible
	with ultrawide gamut spaces. For example, <em>all</em>
	of the ''prophoto-rgb'' primaries and secondaries
	exceed this range, but are within ±200.

	<a href="#serializing-alpha-values">As noted earlier</a>,
	unitary alpha values are not explicitly serialized.
	Non-unitary alpha values must be explicitly serialized,
	and the string " / "
	(an ASCII space, then forward slash, then another space)
	must be used to separate the b component value from the alpha value.

	<div class="example" id="ex-lch-alpha">
		<p>The serialized value of</p>
		<pre class="lang-css"><span class="swatch" style="--color: rgba(99.56%, 6.09%, 57.02%, 0.93)"></span> lch(56.2% 83.6 357.4 /93%)</pre>

	</div>

	<h4 id="serializing-color-function-values">Serializing values of the ''color()'' function</h4>

	The serialized form of ''color()'' values
	is derived from the [=computed value=]
	and uses the ''color()'' form,
	with lowercase letters for the function name
	and the colorspace name.

	The component values are serialized in base 10,
	as <<number>>.
	A single ASCII space character " "
	must be used as the separator
	between the component values,
	and also between the colorspace name and the first color component.

	Trailing fractional zeroes in any component values must be omitted;
	if the fractional part consists of all zeroes,
	the decimal point must also be omitted.

	<div class="example" id="ex-color-serial">

		<p>is the string "color(display-p3 0.96 0.76 0.79)",

	</div>

	<!--
		the name in the @color-profile is also lowercased, right?
		the serialization is not sufficient because the name and the link to the profile are also needed.
	-->

	Note: If the colorspace is sRGB, the colorspace is still explicitly required in the serialized result.

	The precision with which ''color()'' component values are retained,
	and thus the number of significant figures in the serialized value,
	is not defined in this specification,
	but for CMYK colorspaces must at least be sufficient
	to round-trip values
	with eight bit precision;
	this will result in at least two decimal places
	unless trailing zeroes have been omitted.

	For the predefined colorspaces,
	the <em>minimum</em> precision for round-tripping is as follows:

	<table class="data">
		<tr><th>Colorspace</th><th>Minimum bits</th></tr>
		<tr>
			<td>''srgb''</td>
			<td>10</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>''lab''</td>
			<td>16</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	(16bit, half-float, or float <em>per component</em>
	is recommended for internal storage).
	Values must be <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#combine-integers">rounded towards +∞</a>, not truncated.

	Note: compared to the legacy forms
	such as ''rgb()'', ''hsl()'' and so on,
	''color(srgb)'' has a higher minimum precision requirement.
	Stylesheet authors who prefer higher precision
	are thus encouraged to use the ''color(srgb)'' form.

	<a href="#serializing-alpha-values">As noted earlier</a>,
	unitary alpha values are not explicitly serialized.
	Non-unitary alpha values must be explicitly serialized,
	and the string " / "

<h2 id='numeric-srgb'>
sRGB Colors</h2>

	CSS colors in the <dfn id='sRGB' export>sRGB</dfn> color space
	are represented by a triplet of values--
	red, green, and blue--
	identifying a point in the sRGB color space [[!SRGB]].
	This is an internationally-recognized, device-independent color space,
	and so is useful for specifying colors that will be displayed on a computer screen,
	but is also useful for specifying colors on other types of devices, like printers.
	<!-- (See [[COLORIMETRY]].) broken link, find new one and fix in specref -->

	CSS also allows the use of non-sRGB [=colorspace=]s,
	as described in [[#predefined]].

	CSS provides several methods of directly specifying an sRGB color:
	[=hex colors=],
	''rgb()''/''rgba()'' [=color-functions=],
	''hsl()''/''hsla()'' [=color-functions=],
	''hwb()'' [=color-functions|color-function=],
	[=named colors=],
	and the ''transparent'' keyword.


<h3 id='rgb-functions'>
The RGB functions: ''rgb()'' and ''rgba()''</h3>

	The ''rgb()'' function defines an sRGB color by specifying the red, green, and blue channels directly.
	Its syntax is:

	<pre class='prod'>
	<dfn>rgb()</dfn> = rgb( <<percentage>>{3} [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? ) |
	  rgb( <<number>>{3} [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? )
	<dfn>&lt;alpha-value></dfn> = <<number>> | <<percentage>>
	</pre>

	<wpt>
		rgb-001.html
		rgb-002.html
		rgb-003.html
		rgb-004.html
		rgb-005.html
		rgb-006.html
		rgb-007.html
		rgb-008.html
		rgb-rounding-001.html
	</wpt>

	The first three arguments specify the red, green, and blue channels of the color, respectively.
	''0%'' represents the minimum value for that color channel in the sRGB gamut,
	and ''100%'' represents the maximum value.
	A <<number>> is equivalent to a <<percentage>>,
	but with a different range:
	''0'' again represents the minimum value for the color channel,
	but ''255'' represents the maximum.
	These values come from the fact that many graphics engines store the color channels internally as a single byte,
	which can hold integers between 0 and 255.
	Implementations should honor the precision of the channel as authored or calculated wherever possible.
	If this is not possible, the channel should be <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#combine-integers">rounded towards +∞</a>.

	The final argument, the <<alpha-value>>, specifies the alpha of the color.
	If given as a <<number>>, the useful range of the value is ''0''
	(representing a fully transparent color)
	to ''1''
	(representing a fully opaque color).
	If given as a <<percentage>>, ''0%'' represents a fully transparent color,
	while ''100%'' represents a fully opaque color.
	If omitted, it defaults to ''100%''.

	Values outside these ranges are not invalid,
	but are clamped to the ranges defined here at computed-value time.

	For legacy reasons,
	''rgb()'' also supports an alternate syntax
	that separates all of its arguments with commas:

	<pre class='prod'>
	rgb() = rgb( <<percentage>>#{3} , <<alpha-value>>? ) |
	  rgb( <<number>>#{3} , <<alpha-value>>? )
	</pre>

	Also for legacy reasons,
	an <dfn>rgba()</dfn> function also exists,
	with an identical grammar and behavior to ''rgb()''.

		rgba-008.html
	</wpt>

<h3 id='hex-notation'>
The RGB hexadecimal notations: ''#RRGGBB''</h3>

	The CSS <dfn lt="hex color | hex color notation" export>hex color notation</dfn>
	allows an sRGB color to be specified by giving the channels as hexadecimal numbers,
	which is similar to how colors are often written directly in computer code.
	It's also shorter than writing the same color out in ''rgb()'' notation.

	The syntax of a <dfn>&lt;hex-color></dfn> is a <<hash-token>> token whose value consists of 3, 4, 6, or 8 hexadecimal digits.
	In other words, a hex color is written as a hash character, "#",
	followed by some number of digits 0-9 or letters a-f
	(the case of the letters doesn't matter - ''#00ff00'' is identical to ''#00FF00'').

	The number of hex digits given determines how to decode the hex notation into an RGB color:

	<dl>
		<dt>6 digits
		<dd>
			The first pair of digits, interpreted as a hexadecimal number,
			specifies the red channel of the color,
			where ''00'' represents the minimum value
			and ''ff'' (255 in decimal) represents the maximum.
			The next pair of digits, interpreted in the same way,
			specifies the green channel,
			and the last pair specifies the blue.
			The alpha channel of the color is fully opaque.

			<div class='example' id="ex-hex6">
				In other words, <span class="swatch" style="--color: #00ff00"></span>  ''#00ff00'' represents the same color as <span class="swatch" style="--color: #00ff00"></span> ''rgb(0 255 0)'' (a lime green).
			</div>

		<dt>8 digits
		<dd>
			The first 6 digits are interpreted identically to the 6-digit notation.
			The last pair of digits, interpreted as a hexadecimal number,
			specifies the alpha channel of the color,
			where ''00'' represents a fully transparent color
			and ''ff'' represent a fully opaque color.

			<div class='example' id="ex-hex8">
				In other words, <span class="swatch" style="--color: #0000ffcc"></span> ''#0000ffcc'' represents the same color as <span class="swatch" style="--color: #0000ffcc"></span> ''rgb(0 0 100% / 80%)'' (a slightly-transparent blue).
			</div>

		<dt>3 digits
		<dd>
			This is a shorter variant of the 6-digit notation.
			The first digit, interpreted as a hexadecimal number,
			specifies the red channel of the color,
			where ''0'' represents the minimum value
			and ''f'' represents the maximum.
			The next two digits represent the green and blue channels, respectively,
			in the same way.
			The alpha channel of the color is fully opaque.

			<div class='example' id="ex-hex3">
				This syntax is often explained by saying that it's identical to a 6-digit notation obtained by "duplicating" all of the digits.
				For example, the notation <span class="swatch" style="--color: #123"></span> ''#123'' specifies the same color as the notation <span class="swatch" style="--color: #123"></span> ''#112233''.
				This method of specifying a color has lower "resolution" than the 6-digit notation;
				there are only 4096 possible colors expressible in the 3-digit hex syntax,
				as opposed to approximately 17 million in 6-digit hex syntax.
			</div>

		<dt>4 digits
		<dd>
			This is a shorter variant of the 8-digit notation,
			"expanded" in the same way as the 3-digit notation is.
			The first digit, interpreted as a hexadecimal number,
			specifies the red channel of the color,
			where ''0'' represents the minimum value
			and ''f'' represents the maximum.
			The next three digits represent the green, blue, and alpha channels, respectively.

<h2 id='color-keywords'>
Color Keywords</h2>

	In addition to the various numeric syntaxes for <<color>>s,
	CSS defines several sets of color keywords that can be used instead—
	each with their own advantages or use cases.


<h3 id="named-colors">
Named Colors</h3>

	CSS defines a large set of <dfn id="named-color" lt="named color" export>named colors</dfn>,
	so that common colors can be written and read more easily.
	A <dfn>&lt;named-color></dfn> is written as an <<ident>>,
	accepted anywhere a <<color>> is.
	As usual for CSS-defined <<ident>>s,
	all of these keywords are <a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive">ASCII case-insensitive</a>.

	The names resolve to colors in sRGB.

	16 of CSS's named colors come from the VGA palette originally, and were then adopted into HTML:
	aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow.
	Most of the rest
	come from one version of the X11 color system,
	used in Unix-derived systems to specify colors for the console,
	and were then adopted into SVG.

	Note: these color names are standardized here,
	<em>not because they are good</em>,
	but because their use and implementation has been widespread for decades
	and the standard needs to reflect reality.
	Indeed, it is often hard to imagine what each name will look like (hence the list below);
	the names are not evenly distributed throughout the sRGB color volume,
	the names are not even internally consistent
	(<span class="swatch" style="--color: darkgray"></span> ''darkgray'' is lighter than
	<span class="swatch" style="--color: gray"></span> ''gray'', while
	<span class="swatch" style="--color: lightpink"></span> ''lightpink'' is darker than
	<span class="swatch" style="--color: pink"></span> ''pink''),
	and some names
	(such as <span class="swatch" style="--color: indianred"></span> ''indianred'',
	which was originally named after a red pigment from India),
	have been found to be offensive.
	Thus, their use is <em>not encouraged</em>.


	(Two special color values, ''transparent'' and ''<color>/currentcolor'',
		are specially defined in their own sections.)

	The following table defines all of the opaque named colors,
	by giving equivalent numeric specifications in the other color syntaxes.

	<table class="named-color-table" dfn-type=value dfn-for="<color>">

System Colors</h3>

	In general, the <<system-color>> keywords
	reflect <em>default</em> color choices made by the user, the browser, or the OS.
	They are typically used in the browser default stylesheet, for this reason.

	To maintain legibility,
	the <<system-color>> keywords also respond to light mode or dark mode changes.


	<div class="example" id="ex-LM-DM-links">
		For example, traditional <span class="swatch" style="--color: blue"></span>  blue link text is legible on a <span class="swatch" style="--color: #fff"></span> white background
	(WCAG contrast 8.59:1, AAA pass)
	but would not be legible on a <span class="swatch" style="--color: #000"></span>  black background
	(WCAG contrast 2.44:1, AA fail).
	Instead, a lighter blue such as <span class="swatch" style="--color: #81D9FE"></span>  #81D9FE would be used in dark mode
	(WCAG contrast 13.28:1, AAA pass).
		<div style="margin:1em; margin-left: 2em; text-decoration: underline; background: inherit">
		<p style="padding: 4px; background-color: white; color: blue"> Legible link text</p>
		<p style="padding: 4px; background-color: black; color: blue"> Illegible link text</p>
		<p style="padding: 4px; background-color: black; color: #81D9FE"> Legible link text</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	However, in [=forced colors mode=],
	most colors on the page are forced into a restricted, user-chosen palette.
	The <dfn>&lt;system-color></dfn> keywords
	expose these user-chosen colors
	so that the rest of the page can integrate with this restricted palette.

	When the 'forced-colors' [=media feature=] is ''forced-colors/active'',
	authors <em>should</em> use the <<system-color>> keywords as color values
	in properties other than those listed in [[css-color-adjust-1#forced-colors-properties]],
	to ensure legibility and consistency across the page
	and avoid an uncoordinated mishmash of user-forced and page-chosen colors.

	When the values of <<system-color>> keywords come from the browser,
	(as opposed to being OS defaults or user choices) the browser should
	ensure that <a href="#system-color-pairs">matching
	foreground/background pairs</a> have a minimum
	of WCAG AA contrast.
	However, user preferences (for higher or lower contrast),
	whether set as a browser preference, a user stylesheet,
	or by altering the OS defaults,
	must take precedence over this requirement.

	Authors <em>may</em> also use these keywords at any time,
	but <em>should</em> be careful to use the colors
	in <a href="#system-color-pairs">matching background-foreground pairs</a>
	to ensure appropriate contrast,
	as any particular contrast relationship across non-matching pairs
	(e.g. ''Canvas'' and ''ButtonText'')
	is not guaranteed.

	The <<system-color>> keywords are defined as follows:

	<dl id="system-color-values" data-dfn-type="value" dfn-for="<system-color>">
		<dt><dfn>Canvas</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: canvas"></span>&nbsp;Background of application content or documents.
		<dt><dfn>CanvasText</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: canvastext"></span>&nbsp;Text in application content or documents.
		<dt><dfn>LinkText</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: linktext"></span>&nbsp;Text in non-active, non-visited links. For light backgrounds, traditionally blue.
		<dt><dfn>VisitedText</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: visitedtext"></span>&nbsp;Text in visited links. For light backgrounds, traditionally purple.
		<dt><dfn>ActiveText</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: activetext"></span>&nbsp;Text in active links. For light backgrounds, traditionally red.

		<dt><dfn>ButtonFace</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: buttonface"></span>&nbsp;The face background color for push buttons.
		<dt><dfn>ButtonText</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: buttontext"></span>&nbsp;Text on push buttons.
		<dt><dfn>ButtonBorder</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: buttonborder"></span>&nbsp;The base border color for push buttons.

		<dt><dfn>Field</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: field"></span>&nbsp;Background of input fields.
		<dt><dfn>FieldText</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: fieldtext"></span>&nbsp;Text in input fields.

		<dt><dfn>Highlight</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: highlight"></span>&nbsp;Background of selected items/text.
		<dt><dfn>HighlightText</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: highlighttext"></span>&nbsp;Text of selected items/text.

		<dt><dfn>Mark</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: mark"></span>&nbsp;Background of text that has been specially marked
			(such as by the HTML <{mark}> element).
		<dt><dfn>MarkText</dfn>
		<dd><span class="swatch" style="--color: marktext"></span>&nbsp;Text that has been specially marked
			(such as by the HTML <{mark}> element).

	Note: As with all other [=CSS/keywords=],
	these names are <a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive">ASCII case-insensitive</a>.
	They are shown here with mixed capitalization for legibility.

	For systems that do not have a particular system UI concept,
	the specified value should be mapped to
	the most closely related system color value that exists.
	The following <dfn export>system color pairings</dfn> are expected to form legible background-foreground colors:

	<ul id=system-color-pairs>
		* ''Canvas'' background with ''CanvasText'', ''LinkText'', ''VisitedText'', ''ActiveText'' foreground.
		* ''Canvas'' background with a ''ButtonBorder'' border and adjacent color ''Canvas''
		* ''ButtonFace'' background with ''ButtonText'' foreground.
		* ''Field'' background with ''FieldText'' foreground.
		* ''Mark'' background with ''MarkText'' foreground
		* ''ButtonFace'' or ''Field'' background with a ''ButtonBorder'' border and adjacent color ''Canvas'''
		* ''Highlight'' background with ''HighlightText'' foreground.
	</ul>

	Additionally, ''GrayText'' is expected to be readable,
	though possibly at a lower contrast rating,
	over any of the backgrounds.

	<div class="example" id="ex-SystemCombo">
		For example, the system color combinations in the browser you are currently using:

		<p>Canvas with CanvasText <span style="background-color:Canvas; color:CanvasText">CanvasText</span></p>
		<p>Canvas with LinkText <span style="background-color:Canvas; color:LinkText">LinkText</span></p>
		<p>Canvas with VisitedText <span style="background-color:Canvas; color:VisitedText">VisitedText</span></p>
		<p>Canvas with ActiveText <span style="background-color:Canvas; color:ActiveText">ActiveText</span></p>
		<p>Canvas with GrayText <span style="background-color:Canvas; color:GrayText">GrayText</span></p>
		<p>Canvas with ButtonBorder and adjacent Canvas <span style="background-color:Canvas; border: ButtonBorder; color:CanvasText; padding: 3px">CanvasText</span><span style="background-color:Canvas; color:CanvasText">Adjacent</span></p>
		<p>ButtonFace with ButtonText <span style="background-color:ButtonFace; color:ButtonText">ButtonText</span></p>
		<p>ButtonFace with ButtonText and ButtonBorder <span style="background-color:ButtonFace; color:ButtonText; border:ButtonBorder; padding: 3px">ButtonText</span></p>
		<p>ButtonFace with GrayText <span style="background-color:ButtonFace; color:GrayText">GrayText</span></p>
		<p>Field with FieldText <span style="background-color:Field; color:FieldText">FieldText</span></p>
		<p>Field with GrayText <span style="background-color:Field; color:GrayText">GrayText</span></p>

		<p>Mark with GrayText <span style="background-color:Mark; color:GrayText">GrayText</span></p>
		<p>Highlight with HighlightText <span style="background-color:Highlight; color:HighlightText">HighlightText</span></p>
		<p>Highlight with GrayText <span style="background-color:Highlight; color:GrayText">GrayText</span></p>
	</div>

	Earlier versions of CSS defined additional <<system-color>>s,
	which have since been deprecated.
	These are documented in [[#deprecated-system-colors]].

	Note: The <<system-color>>s incur some privacy and security risk, as detailed in [[#priv-sec]].

<h3 id='transparent-color'>
The ''transparent'' keyword</h3>

	The keyword <dfn value for="<color>">transparent</dfn> specifies a <a>transparent black</a>.
	It is a type of <<named-color>>.


<h3 id='currentcolor-color'>
The ''<color>/currentcolor'' keyword</h3>

	The keyword <dfn value for="<color>">currentcolor</dfn> represents value of the 'color' property on the same element.
	Its <a>used values</a> is determined by <a href="#resolving-other-colors">resolving color values</a>.

	<wpt>
		currentcolor-001.html
		currentcolor-002.html
	</wpt>

	<div class='example' id="ex-currentcolor">
		Here's a simple example showing how to use the ''<color>/currentcolor'' keyword:

		<pre class="lang-css">
		.foo {
			color: <span class="swatch" style="--color: red"></span>&nbsp;red;
			background-color: <span class="swatch" style="--color: red"></span>&nbsp;currentcolor;
		}
		</pre>

		This is equivalent to writing:

		<pre class="lang-css">
		.foo {
			color: <span class="swatch" style="--color: red"></span>&nbsp;red;
			background-color: <span class="swatch" style="--color: red"></span>&nbsp;red;
		}
		</pre>
	</div>

	<div class='example' id="ex-textemph-currentcolor">
		For example, the 'text-emphasis-color' property [[CSS3-TEXT-DECOR]],
		whose initial value is ''<color>/currentcolor'',
		by default matches the text color
		even as the 'color' property changes across elements.

		<pre class="language-markup">
			&lt;p>&lt;em>Some &lt;strong>really&lt;/strong> emphasized text.&lt;/em>
			&lt;style>
			p { color: black; }
			em { text-emphasis: dot; }
			strong { color: red; }
			&lt;/style>
		</pre>

		<p><img src="images/text-emphasis.png" alt="rendered emphasized text with the word 'really' in red with red emphasis dots"/></p>

		In the above example, the emphasis marks are black over the text "Some" and "emphasized text",
		but red over the text "really".
	</div>

	Note: Multi-word keywords in CSS usually separate their component words with hyphens.
	''<color>/currentcolor'' doesn't, because (deep breath)
	it was originally introduced in SVG
	as a property value, "current-color" with the usual CSS spelling.
	It (along with all other properties and their values)
	then became presentation attributes and attribute values,
	as well as properties,
	to make generation with XSLT easier.
	Then all of the presentation attributes were changed
	from hyphenated to camelCase, because the DOM
	had an isse with hyphen meaning "minus".
	But then, they didn't follow CSS conventions
	anymore so all the properties and property values
	that were <em>already</em> part of CSS were changed back to hyphenated!
	''<color>/currentcolor'' was not a part of CSS at that time,
	so remained camelCased.
	Only later did CSS pick it up,
	at which point the capitalization stopped mattering,
	as CSS keywords are <a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive">ASCII case-insensitive</a>.


<h2 id='the-hsl-notation'>
HSL Colors: ''hsl()'' and ''hsla()'' functions</h2>

	The RGB system for specifying colors,
	while convenient for machines and graphic libraries,
	is often regarded as very difficult for humans to gain an intuitive grasp on.
	It's not easy to tell, for example,
	how to alter an RGB color to produce a lighter variant of the same hue.

	There are several other color schemes possible.
	One such is the HSL color scheme,
	which is much more intuitive to use,
	but still maps easily back to RGB colors.

	HSL colors are specified as a triplet of hue, saturation, and lightness.
	The syntax of the ''hsl()'' function is:

	<pre class='prod'>
	<dfn>hsl()</dfn> = hsl( <<hue>> <<percentage>> <<percentage>> [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? )
	</pre>

	<wpt>
		hsl-001.html
		hsl-002.html
		hsl-003.html
		hsl-004.html
		hsl-005.html
		hsl-006.html
		hsl-007.html
		hsl-008.html
	</wpt>

	The first argument specifies the hue angle.

	In HSL (and HWB) the angle ''0deg'' represents sRGB primary red
	(as does ''360deg'', ''720deg'', etc.),
	and the rest of the hues are spread around the circle,
	so ''120deg'' represents sRGB primary green,
	''240deg'' represents sRGB primary blue, etc.

	The next two arguments are the saturation and lightness, respectively.
	For saturation, ''100%'' is a fully-saturated, bright color,
	and ''0%'' is a fully-unsaturated gray.
	For lightness, ''50%'' represents the "normal" color,
	while ''100%'' is white and ''0%'' is black.
	If the saturation or lightness are less than ''0%''
	or greater than ''100%'',
	they are clamped to those values
	at computed value time,
	before being converted to an sRGB color.

	The final argument specifies the alpha channel of the color.
	It's interpreted identically to the fourth argument of the ''rgb()'' function.
	If omitted, it defaults to ''100%''.

	HSL colors resolve to sRGB.

	<div class='example' id="ex-hsl-primary-red">
		For example, an ordinary red,
		the same color you would see from the keyword <span class="swatch" style="--color: red"></span>&nbsp;''red''
		or the hex notation <span class="swatch" style="--color: red"></span>&nbsp;''#f00'',
		is represented in HSL as <span class="swatch" style="--color: red"></span>&nbsp;''hsl(0deg 100% 50%)''.
	</div>

	An advantage of HSL over RGB is that it is more intuitive:
	people can guess at the colors they want,
	and then tweak.

	<div class='example' id="ex-hsl-tweak">
		For example, the following colors can all be generated off of the basic "green" hue,
		just by varying the other two arguments:

		<pre class="lang-css">
		hsl(120deg 100% 50%) <span style="color:black; background:hsl(120,100%,50%);">lime green</span>
		hsl(120deg 100% 25%) <span style="color:white; background:hsl(120,100%,25%);">dark green</span>
		hsl(120deg 100% 75%) <span style="color:black; background:hsl(120,100%,75%);">light green</span>
		hsl(120deg 75% 85%)  <span style="color:black; background:hsl(120,75%,85%);">pastel green</span>
		</pre>
	</div>

	An advantage of HSL over LCH is that,
	regardless of manipulation,
	the result always lies inside the sRGB gamut.
	A disadvantage of HSL over LCH
	is that hue manipulation changes the visual lightness,
	and that hues are not evenly spaced apart.

	It is thus easier in HSL to create sets of matching colors
	(by keeping the hue the same and varying the saturation and lightness),
	compared to maipulating the sRGB component values;
	however, because the lightness is simply the mean of the gamma-corrected
	red, green and blue components
	it does not correspond to the visual perception of lightness
	across hues.

	<div class="example" id="ex-hsl-sucks">
		For example, <span class="swatch" style="--color: blue"></span>&nbsp;''blue''
		is represented in HSL as
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: blue"></span>&nbsp;''hsl(240deg 100% 50%)''
		while <span class="swatch" style="--color: yellow"></span>&nbsp;''yellow''
		is <span class="swatch" style="--color: yellow"></span>&nbsp;''hsl(60deg 100% 50%)''.
		Both have an HSL Lightness of 50%,
		but clearly the yellow looks much lighter than the blue.

		In LCH, sRGB blue is
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: blue"></span>&nbsp;''lch(29.6% 131.2 301.3)''
		while
		sRGB yellow is
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: yellow"></span>&nbsp;''lch(97.6% 94.7 99.6)''.
		The LCH Lightnesses of 29.6% and 97.6% clearly reflect
		the visual lightnesses of the two colors.
	</div>

	The hue angle in HSL is not perceptually uniform;
	colors appear bunched up in some areas
	and widely spaced in others.

	<div class="example" id="ex-hsl-sucks-more">
		For example, the pair of hues

	For legacy reasons,
	''hsl()'' also supports an alternate syntax
	that separates all of its arguments with commas:

	<pre class='prod'>
	hsl() = hsl( <<hue>>, <<percentage>>, <<percentage>>, <<alpha-value>>? )
	</pre>

	Also for legacy reasons,
	an <dfn>hsla()</dfn> function also exists,
	with an identical grammar and behavior to ''hsl()''.

Converting HSL colors to sRGB colors</h3>

	Converting an HSL color to sRGB is straightforward mathematically.
	Here's a simple implementation of the conversion algorithm in JavaScript.
	For simplicity, this algorithm assumes that the hue has been normalized to
	a number in the half-open range [0, 6),
	and the saturation and lightness have been normalized to the range [0, 1].
	It returns an array of three numbers
	representing the red, green, and blue channels of the colors,
	normalized to the range [0, 1].

	<pre class='lang-javascript'>
	function hslToRgb(hue, sat, light) {
		if( light &lt;= .5 ) {
			var t2 = light * (sat + 1);
		} else {
			var t2 = light + sat - (light * sat);
		}
		var t1 = light * 2 - t2;
		var r = hueToRgb(t1, t2, hue + 2);
		var g = hueToRgb(t1, t2, hue);
		var b = hueToRgb(t1, t2, hue - 2);
		return [r,g,b];
	}

	function hueToRgb(t1, t2, hue) {
		if(hue &lt; 0) hue += 6;
		if(hue >= 6) hue -= 6;

		if(hue &lt; 1) return (t2 - t1) * hue + t1;
		else if(hue &lt; 3) return t2;
		else if(hue &lt; 4) return (t2 - t1) * (4 - hue) + t1;
		else return t1;
	}
	</pre>

<h3 id='hsl-examples'>
Examples of HSL colors</h3>

	The tables below illustrate a wide range of possible HSL colors.
	Each table represents one hue,
	selected at 30° intervals,
	to illustrate the common "core" hues:
	red,
	yellow,
	green,
	cyan,
	blue,
	magenta,
	and the six intermediary colors between these.

	In each table, the X axis represents the saturation
	while the Y axis represents the lightness.

	Issue(3088):

	<div class="note">The conversions in the table below are known to contain errors. They are copied from CSS Color 3, which also had the same errors. Those colors were supposedly computed by a program in ABC. A future spec will correctly compute those colors. Meanwhile, please note that these conversions are non-normative examples.</div>

HWB Colors: ''hwb()'' function</h2>

	HWB (short for Hue-Whiteness-Blackness) is another method of specifying colors,
	similar to HSL, but often even easier for humans to work with.
	It describes colors with a starting hue,
	then a degree of whiteness and blackness to mix into that base hue.

	Many color-pickers are based on the HWB color system,
	due to its intuitiveness.

	HWB colors resolve to sRGB.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/color-picker.png">
		<figcaption>
			This is a screenshot of Chrome's color picker,
			shown when a user activates an <code class='lang-markup'>&lt;input type="color"></code>.
			The outer wheel is used to select the hue,
			then the relative amounts of white and black are selected by clicking on the inner triangle.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	The syntax of the ''hwb()'' function is:

	<pre class='prod'>
		<dfn>hwb()</dfn> = hwb( <<hue>> <<percentage>> <<percentage>> [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? )
	</pre>

	The first argument specifies the hue,
	and is interpreted identically to ''hsl()''.

	The second argument specifies the amount of white to mix in,
	as a percentage from ''0%'' (no whiteness) to ''100%'' (full whiteness).
	Similarly, the third argument specifies the amount of black to mix in,
	also from ''0%'' (no blackness) to ''100%'' (full blackness).
	Values outside of these ranges
	are not invalid,
	but are clamped to the ranges defined here at computed-value time.
	If the sum of these two arguments is greater than 100%,
	then at computed-value time they are further normalized to add up to 100%,
	with the same relative ratio.

	The fourth argument specifies the alpha channel of the color.
	It's interpreted identically to the fourth argument of the ''rgb()'' function.
	If omitted, it defaults to ''100%''.

	The resulting color can be thought of conceptually as a mixture of paint in the chosen hue,
	white paint, and black paint,
	with the relative amounts of each determined by the percentages.
	If white+black is equal to ''100%'' (after normalization),
	it defines an achromatic color,
	i.e. some shade of gray,
	without any hint of the chosen hue.

<h3 id='hwb-to-rgb'>
Converting HWB colors to sRGB colors</h3>

	Converting an HWB color to sRGB is straightforward,
	and related to how one converts HSL to RGB.
	The following Javascript implementation of the algorithm
	first normalizes the white and black components,
	so their sum is no larger than 100%.

	<pre class="lang-javascript">
	white /= 100;
	black /= 100;
	if (white + black >= 1) {
		var gray = white / (white + black);
		return [gray, gray, gray];
	  }
	function hwbToRgb(hue, white, black) {
		var rgb = hslToRgb(hue, 1, .5);
		for(var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
			rgb[i] *= (1 - white - black);
			rgb[i] += white;
		}
		return rgb;
	}
	</pre>

<h3 id="rgb-to-hwb">Converting sRGB colors to HWB colors</h3>

	Conversion in the reverse direction proceeds similarly.

<pre class="lang-javascript">
	function rgbToHwb(red, green, blue) {
		var hsl = rgbToHsl(rgb);
		var white = Math.min(...rgb);
		var black = 1 - Math.max(...rgb);
		return([hsl[0], white*100, black*100]);
	}
</pre>

<h2 id='lab-colors'>
Device-independent Colors: Lab and LCH</h2>

	Physical measurements of a color are typically expressed in the CIE L*a*b* [[!CIELAB]] color space,
	created in 1976 by the <abbr title='Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage'>CIE</abbr>
	and commonly referred to simply as Lab.
	Color conversions from one device to another also use Lab as an intermediate step.
	Derived from human vision experiments,
	Lab represents the entire range of color that humans can see.

	<!-- Simplify by saying Lab throughout rather than CIELab or
	CIE L*a*b*, because that is what people write in practice.
	No-one has used Hunter Lab for anything for decades.  -->

	Lab is a rectangular coordinate system with a central Lightness axis.
	This value is usually written as a unitless number;
	for compatibility with the rest of CSS, it is written as a percentage.
	100% means an L value of 100, not 1.0.
	L=0% is deep black (no light at all)
	while L=100% is a diffuse white

	Values of L greater than 100 would correspond to specular highlights,
	but their precise color is undefined in this specification.
	Usefully, L=50% is mid gray, by design,
	and equal increments in L are evenly spaced visually:
	the Lab color space is intended to be <em>perceptually uniform</em>.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/L-axis.svg" style="width: 30vmin">
		<figcaption>
			This figure shows the Lightness axis of the CIE Lab colorspace.
			Twenty neutral swatches are shown (L=0%, L=5%, to L=100%).
			The steps are equally spaced, visually.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	The a and b axes convey hue;
	positive values along the a axis are a purplish red
	while negative values are the complementary color, a green.
	Similarly, positive values along the b axis are yellow
	and negative are the complementary blue/violet.
	Desaturated colors have small values of a and b
	and are close to the L axis;
	saturated colors lie far from the L axis.


	<!-- diagram here -->

	The illuminant is D50 white, a standardized daylight spectrum with a color temperature of 5000K,
	as reflected by a perfect diffuse reflector; it approximates the color of sunlight on a sunny day.
	D50 is also the whitepoint used for the profile connection space in ICC color interconversion,
	the whitepoint used in image editors which offer Lab editing,
	and the value used by physical measurement devices such as spectrometers,
	when they report measured colors in Lab.

	Conversion from colors specified using other white points is called a <dfn export>chromatic adaptation transform</dfn>,
	which models the changes in the human visual system as we adapt to a new lighting condition.
	The Bradford algorithm [[!Bradford-CAT]]
	is the industry standard chromatic adaptation transform,
	and is easy to calculate as it is a simple matrix multiplication.

	LCH has the same L axis as Lab,
	but uses polar coordinates C (chroma) and H (hue),
	making it a polar, cylindrical coordinate system.
	C is the geometric distance from the L axis
	and H is the angle from the positive a axis,
	towards the positive b axis.

	<figure>
		<img src="images/CH-plane-wheel.svg">
		<figcaption>
			This figure shows the L=50 plane of the CIE Lab colorspace.
			20 degree increments in CIE LCH are displayed as circles
			at three levels of Chroma: 20, 40 and 60.
			All the 20 Chroma colors fit inside sRGB gamut,
			some of 40 and 60 Chroma are outside.
			These out of gamut colors are visualized as grey, with a red warning outer stroke.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<!-- because Luv is not widely used nowadays, no need to say LCH(ab)
	to distinguish from LCH(uv) -->

	<p class="note">Note: The Lightness axis in Lab and LCH
	is not to be confused with the L axis in HSL.
	For example, in HSL, the sRGB colors blue (#00F) and yellow (#FF0)
	have the same value of L (50%) even though visually, blue is much darker.
	This is much clearer in Lab:
	sRGB blue is lab(29.567% 68.298 -112.0294)
	while
	sRGB yellow is lab(97.607% -15.753 93.388).
	In Lab and LCH, if two colors have the same measured L value,
	they have identical visual lightness.
	HSL and related polar RGB models were developed
	in an attempt
	to give similar usability benefits for RGB that LCH gave to Lab,
	but are significantly less accurate.</p>

	CSS allows colors to be directly expressed in Lab and LCH.

	<pre class='prod'>
	<dfn>lab()</dfn> = lab( <<percentage>> <<number>> <<number>> [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? )
	</pre>

	</wpt>

	The first argument specifies the CIE Lightness.
	This is typically a number between ''0%''
	(representing black)
	and ''100%''
	(representing white),
	<!-- not really true, as noted above
		similar to the lightness argument of ''hsl()''. -->
	However, CIE Lightness <em>can</em> exceed this range on some systems,
	with extra-bright whites using a lightness up to ''400''.
	Values less than ''0%'' must be clamped to ''0%'' at computed-value time;
	values greater than
	''100%'' are permitted (for forwards compatibility with High Dynamic Range (HDR),
	and must not be clamped.

	The second and third arguments are the distances along the "a" and "b" axes
	in the Lab colorspace,
	as described in the previous section.
	These values are signed
	(allow both positive and negative values)
	and theoretically unbounded
	(but in practice do not exceed ±160).

	There is an optional fourth alpha value,
	separated by a slash,
	and interpreted identically to the <<alpha-value>> in ''rgb()''.


	<div class="example" id="ex-lab-samples">
		<pre class="lang-css">

	The first argument specifies the CIE Lightness,
	interpreted identically to the Lightness argument of ''lab()''.

	The second argument is the chroma
	(roughly representing the "amount of color").
	Its minimum useful value is ''0'',
	while its maximum is theoretically unbounded
	(but in practice does not exceed ''230'').
	If the provided value is negative,
	it is clamped to ''0'' at computed-value time.

	The third argument is the hue angle.
	It's interpreted similarly to the <<hue>> argument of ''hsl()'',
	but doesn't map hues to angles in the same way
	because they are evenly spaced perceptually.
	Instead, ''0deg'' points along the positive "a" axis (toward purplish red),
	(as does ''360deg'', ''720deg'', etc.);
	''90deg'' points along the positive "b" axis (toward mustard yellow),
	''180deg'' points along the negative "a" axis (toward greenish cyan),
	and ''270deg'' points along the negative "b" axis (toward sky blue).

	There is an optional fourth alpha value,
	separated by a slash,
	and interpreted identically to the <<alpha-value>> in ''rgb()''.

Converting RGB colors to Lab colors</h3>

	Conversion from an RGB colorspace to Lab requires several steps,
	although in practice all but the first step are linear calculations and can be combined. Taking sRGB as an example:

	<!-- make these steps links to the appropriate section in a calculations appendix -->
	<ol>
		<li>Convert from sRGB to <dfn id="linear-light-sRGB" export>linear-light sRGB</dfn> (undo gamma encoding).
			This has the same gamut as sRGB,
			but is now additive,
			so that arithmetic operations on the values
			give the correct results.
		<li>Convert from linear sRGB to CIE XYZ
		<li>Convert from a D65 whitepoint (used by sRGB) to the D50 whitepoint used
			in Lab, with the Bradford transform [[!Bradford-CAT]]
		<li>Convert D50-adapted XYZ to Lab
	</ol>

	There is sample JavaScript code for this conversion
	for various RGB colorspaces, in [[#color-conversion-code]].

<h3 id='lab-to-rgb'>
Converting Lab colors to RGB colors</h3>

	For display on a screen,
	Lab colors will need to be converted
	to the colorspace of the display.

	Conversion from Lab to an RGB space also requires multiple steps,
	and again in practice all but the last step are linear calculations and can be combined. Taking display-p3 as an example,

	<ol>
		<li>Convert Lab to (D50-adapted) XYZ
		<li>Convert from a D50 whitepoint (used by Lab) to the D65 whitepoint used
			in display-p3, with the Bradford transform
		<li>Convert from (D65-adapted) CIE XYZ to linear-light display-p3
		<li>Convert from linear-light display-p3 to display-p3 (do gamma encoding)
	</ol>

	There is sample JavaScript code for this conversion
	for various RGB colorspaces, in [[#color-conversion-code]].

<h3 id="cmyk-to-lab">
Converting CMYK colors to Lab

	Conversion from a calibrated CMYK colorspace to Lab
	is typically done by looking up the Lab values in an ICC profile.

<h3 id='lab-to-lch'>

	Conversion to LCH is trivial:

<h2 id='icc-colors'>
Profiled, Device-dependent Colors</h2>

	CSS allows [=colors=] to be specified by reference to a color profile.
	This could be for example a calibrated CMYK printer,
	or an RGB colorspace,
	or any other color or monochrome output device which has been characterized.

	In addition, for convenience,
	CSS provides several predefined color spaces
	including ''display-p3''' [[!DCI-P3]],
	which is a wide gamut space typical of current wide-gamut monitors,
	''prophoto-rgb''', widely used by photographers
	and ''rec2020''' [[!Rec.2020]],
	which is a broadcast industry standard,
	ultra-wide gamut space capable of representing almost all visible real-world colors.

	These can be used without supplying a separate profile.

	<div class='example' id="ex-profiles-colors">
		This example specifies four profiled colors:
		two are custom spaces
		(for a SWOP-coated CMYK press,
		for a wide-gamut seven-ink printer),
		the other two are predefined spaces
		(the ProPhoto RGB,
		and display-p3 RGB spaces).
		In each case, the numerical parameters
		are in the range 0.0 to 1.0
		(rather than, for example, 0 to 255).
		<!-- add examples with alpha, and with fallback -->
		<pre class="lang-css">
			color: color(--swopc 0.0134 0.8078 0.7451 0.3019);
			color: color(--indigo 0.0941 0.6274 0.3372 0.1647 0 0.0706 0.1216);
			color: color(prophoto-rgb 0.9137 0.5882 0.4784);
			color: color(display-p3 0.3804 0.9921 0.1412);
		</pre>

		The colors not using a <a href="#predefined">predefined</a> colorspace
		are distinguished by their use of <<dashed-ident>> and
		also need a matching ''@color-profile'' at-rule
		somewhere in the stylesheet,
		to connect the name with the profile data.

		<pre class="lang-css">
			@color-profile --swopc {
				src: url('http://example.org/swop-coated.icc');}
			@color-profile --indigo {
				src: url('http://example.org/indigo-seven.icc');}
		</pre>
	</div>

<h3 id="color-function">Specifying profiled colors: the ''color()'' function</h3>

	The ''color()'' function allows a color to be specified
	in a particular, specified [=colorspace=]
	(rather than the implicit sRGB colorspace that most of the other color functions operate in).
	Its syntax is:

	<pre class='prod'>
		<dfn>color()</dfn> = color( [ [<<ident>> | <<dashed-ident>>] [ <<number-percentage>>+ | <<string>> ] [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? ]# , <<color>>? )
	</pre>

	<wpt>
		color-function-parsing.html
	</wpt>

	The color function takes one or more comma-separated arguments,
	with each argument specifying a color,
	and later colors acting as "fallback" if an earlier color [=can't be displayed=]
	(for example, if the colorspace it specifies hasn't been loaded yet).

	Each argument represents either an <dfn export>invalid color</dfn>, as described below,
	or a [=valid color=].

	Any color which is not an [=invalid color=] is a <dfn export>valid color</dfn>.

	A color may be a [=valid color=]
	but still be outside the range of colors
	that can be produced by an output device
	(a screen, projector, or printer).
	It is said to be <dfn export>out of gamut</dfn>
	for that colorspace.

	An out of gamut color has component values
	less than 0 or 0%, or greater than 1 or 100%.
	These are are not invalid; instead, for display, they are
	<a>gamut-mapped</a> using a relative colorimetric intent
	which brings the values within the range 0/0% to 1/100%
	at computed-value time.

	Each [=valid color=] is either in-gamut for the output device (screen, or printer),
	or it is [=out of gamut=].

	Each argument has the following form:

	* An <<ident>>  or <<dashed-ident>> denoting the colorspace.
		If this is an <<ident>> it denotes one of the <a href="#predefined">predefined colorspaces</a>
		(such as ''display-p3'');
		if it is a <<dashed-ident>> it denotes a custom
		colorspace, defined by a ''@color-profile'' rule.
		Individual <a href="#predefined">predefined colorspaces</a>
		may further restrict whether <<number>>s or <<percentage>>s
		or both, may be used.

		If the <<ident>> names a non-existent colorspace
		(a name that does not match one of the <a href="#predefined">predefined colorspaces</a>),
		or a predefined but unsupprted colorspace,
		this argument represents an <a>invalid color</a>.

		<!-- check for WPT tests that allow sRGB to be omitted -->
		<wpt>
			predefined-014.html
		</wpt>

		If the <<dashed-ident>> names a non-existent colorspace
		( a name that does not match an <a>color profile's</a> name,
		  or which matches but the corresponding profile has not loaded,
		  or does not represent a valid profile),
		this argument represents an <a>invalid color</a>.


	* Either one or more <<number>>s or <<percentage>>s providing the parameter values that the colorspace takes,
		or a <<string>> giving the name of a color defined by the colorspace.

		<dl class=switch>
			<dt>If the colorspace takes numeric parameters
			<dd>

				For custom colorspaces,
				specified component values
				less than 0 or 0%, or greater than 1 or 100%
				are not invalid;
				they are clamped to the valid range at computed value time.
				This is because ICC profiles typically do not accept
				out of range input values.

				For predefined colorspaces,
				specified component values
				less than 0 or 0%, or greater than 1 or 100%
				are not invalid;
				these out of gamut colors
				are gamut mapped to the valid range at computed value time,
				with a relative colorimetric intent.

				If more <<number>>s or <<percentage>>s are provided than parameters that the colorspace takes,
				the excess <<number>>s at the end are ignored.
				The color is still a [=valid color=].

				If fewer <<number>>s or <<percentage>>s are provided than parameters that the colorspace takes,
				the missing parameters default to ''0''.
				(This is particularly convenient for multichannel printers
				where the additional inks are spot colors or varnishes
				that most colors on the page won't use.)
				The color is still a [=valid color=].

				If a <<string>> is provided,
				this argument represents an <a>invalid color</a>.
			<dt>If the colorspace defines named colors
			<dd>
				If <<number>>s or <<percentage>>s are provided,
				or a <<string>> is provided that doesn't match any of the color names
				defined by the colorspace,
				this argument represents an <a>invalid color</a>.
		</dl>

	* An optional slash-separated <<alpha-value>>.
		This is interpreted the same way as the <<alpha-value>> in ''rgb()'',
		and if omitted it defaults to ''100%''.

	After one or more arguments of the above form,
	a final <<color>> argument
	using any CSS color syntax
	can be provided.

	<wpt>
		predefined-015.html
	</wpt>

	This final argument can again be either a [=valid color=]
	or an [=invalid color=]; and if valid it can be either
	in-gamut for the output device, or [=out of gamut=].

	A color which is either an [=invalid color=] or
	an [=out of  gamut=] color
	<dfn export>can't be displayed</dfn>.

	The first choice for the value of  the ''color()'' function
	is that it represents the color
	specified by the first of its arguments that
	<dfn export>can be displayed</dfn>,
	(that is, the first argument that isn't an [=invalid color=]
	and isn't [=out of gamut=]).

	If all of its arguments [=can't be displayed=]],
	second choice  for the value of the ''color()'' function
	is that it represents the color
	specified by the first of its arguments that represent

	If all of its arguments are [=invalid color=]s,

	<div class="example" id="ex-2020-oog-p3">
		This very intense lime color is in-gamut for rec.2020:

		in LCH, that color is

			''a98-rgb'' is compatible with Adobe® RGB (1998) [[!AdobeRGB]].

			Adobe® RGB (1998) uses primaries originally derived

		<dt><dfn>prophoto-rgb</dfn>
			<dd>
				The ''prophoto-rgb'' colorspace accepts three numeric parameters,
				representing the red, green, and blue channels of the color,
				with each having a valid range of [0, 1]. The transfer curve is
				a gamma function with a value of 1/1.8,
				and a small linear portion near black.
				The white point is D50, the same as is used by CIE Lab. Thus,
				conversion to Lab does not require the chromatic adaptation step.

				The ProPhoto RGB space uses hyper-saturated,
				non physically realizable primaries.
				These were chosen to allow
				a wide color gamut and in particular,
				to minimise hue shifts under tonal manipulation.
				It is often used in digital photography as a wide gamut
				colorspace for the master version of
				photographic images. The ''prophoto-rgb'' colorspace allows CSS to
				specify colors that will match colors in such images
				having the same RGB values.

				The white luminance is given as a range, and
				the viewing flare (and thus, the black luminance)
				is 0.5% to 1.0% of this.

Converting predefined colorspaces to Lab</h4>

	For all predefined color spaces,
	conversion to Lab requires several steps,
	although in practice all but the first step are linear calculations and can be combined.

	<!-- make these steps links to the appropriate section in a calculations appendix -->
	<ol>
		<li>Convert from gamma-corrected RGB to linear-light RGB (undo gamma encoding)
		<li>Convert from linear RGB to CIE XYZ
		<li>Convert from a D65 whitepoint (used by sRGB, ''display-p3'', ''a98-rgb'' and ''rec2020'') to the D50 whitepoint used in Lab,
			with the Bradford transform. ''prophoto-rgb''' already has a D50 whitepoint.
		<li>Convert D50-adapted XYZ to Lab
	</ol>


<h4 id="lab-to-predefined">
Converting Lab to predefined colorspaces</h4>

	Conversion from Lab to display-p3 or rec2020 also requires multiple steps,
	and again in practice all but the last step are linear calculations and can be combined.

	<ol>
		<li>Convert Lab to (D50-adapted) XYZ
		<li>Convert from a D50 whitepoint (used by Lab) to the D65 whitepoint used in sRGB and most other RGB spaces,
			with the Bradford transform. ''prophoto-rgb''' does not require this step.
		<li>Convert from (D65-adapted) CIE XYZ to linear RGB
		<li>Convert from linear-light RGB to RGB (do gamma encoding)
	</ol>

	Implementations may choose to implement these steps in some other way
	(for example, using an ICC profile with relative colorimetric rendering intent)
	provided the results are the same for colors inside both the source and destination gamuts.

<h3 id="at-profile">
Specifying a color profile: the ''@color-profile'' at-rule</h3>

	The <dfn at-rule id="at-ruledef-profile">@color-profile</dfn> rule
	defines and names a <dfn lt="CSS color profile" local-lt="color profile">color profile</dfn>
	which can later be used in the ''color()'' function to specify a color.
	It's defined as:

	<pre class='prod'>
	@color-profile = @color-profile [<<dashed-ident>> | ''device-cmyk''] { <<declaration-list>> }
	</pre>

	The <<dashed-ident>> gives the <a>color profile's</a> name,
	by which it will be used in a CSS stylesheet.
	Alternatively, the ''device-cmyk'' keyword means that this color profile
	will be used to resolve colors specified in ''device-cmyk''.
	<!-- All of the predefined colorspace keywords
	(''srgb'', ''display-p3'', ''a98-rgb'', ''prophoto-rgb'', ''rec2020'')
	are excluded from this <<custom-ident>>,
	as they're predefined by this specification and always available. -->

	The ''@color-profile'' rule accepts the descriptors defined in this specification.

	<pre class=descdef for="@color-profile">
	Name: src
	Value: <<url>>
	For: @color-profile
	Initial: n/a
	</pre>

	The '@color-profile/src' descriptor specifies the URL to retrieve the color-profile information from.

	Note: The Internet Media Type ("MIME type")
	for ICC profiles is
	<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.iccprofile">application/vnd.iccprofile</a>.

	<!-- should we add a format field to this descriptor, like with font-face src? it is always ICC format
	in practice, but that could change in the future. or we could add format later, once there is
	a need, and make the default ICC if not specified -->

	<!-- we decided in San Francisco to not allow rendering intent to be specified in the CSS;
	just use the rendering intent provided by the profile. However, leave in for FPWD. -->

	<pre class=descdef>
	Name: rendering-intent
	Value: relative-colorimetric | absolute-colorimetric | perceptual | saturation
	Initial: relative-colorimetric
	For: @color-profile
	</pre>

	<a>Color profiles</a> contain “rendering intents”,
	which define how to map their color to smaller gamuts than they're defined over.
	Often a profile will contain only a single intent,
	but when there are multiple,
	the 'rendering-intent' descriptor chooses one of them to use.

	The four possible rendering intents are [[!ICC]]:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@color-profile/rendering-intent">
		<dt><dfn>relative-colorimetric</dfn>
		<dd>
			Media-relative colorimetric is required to leave source colors that fall
			inside the destination medium gamut unchanged relative to the respective
			media white points. Source colors that are out of the destination medium
			gamut are mapped to colors on the gamut boundary using a variety of
			different methods.

			Note: the media-relative colorimetric rendering intent is
			often used with black point compensation, where the source medium black point
			is mapped to the destination medium black point as well.
			This method must map the source white point to the destination white point. If
			black point compensation is in use, the source black point must also be
			mapped to the destination black point. Adaptation algorithms should be used
			to adjust for the change in white point. Relative relationships of colors
			inside both source and destination gamuts should be preserved. Relative
			relationships of colors outside the destination gamut may be changed.

		<dt><dfn>absolute-colorimetric</dfn>
		<dd>
			ICC-absolute colorimetric is required to leave source colors that fall
			inside the destination medium gamut unchanged relative to the adopted
			white (a perfect reflecting diffuser). Source colors that are out of the
			destination medium gamut are mapped to colors on the gamut boundary using a
			variety of different methods. This method produces the most accurate
			color matching of in-gamut colors, but will result in highlight clipping
			if the destination medium white point is lower than the source medium
			white point. For this reason it is recommended for use only in applications
			that need exact color matching and where highlight clipping is not a concern.

			This method MUST disable white point matching and black point matching when
			converting colors. In general, this option is not recommended except
			for testing purposes.

		<dt><dfn>perceptual</dfn>
		<dd>
			This method is often the preferred choice for images, especially when there are
			substantial differences between the source and destination (such as a screen display
			image reproduced on a reflection print). It takes the colors of the source image
			and re-optimizes the appearance for the destination medium using proprietary
			methods. This re-optimization may result in colors within both the source
			and destination gamuts being changed, although perceptual transforms are
			supposed to maintain the basic artistic intent of the original in the
			reproduction. They will not attempt to correct errors in the source image.

			Note: With v2 ICC profiles there is no specified perceptual reference medium,
			which can cause interoperability problems. When v2 ICC profiles are used it may
			be safer to use the media-relative colorimetric rendering intent with black
			point compensation, instead of the perceptual rendering intent, unless the
			specific source and destination profiles to be used have been checked to ensure
			the combination produces the desired result.

			This method should maintain relative color values among the pixels as they
			are mapped to the target device gamut. This method may change pixel values
			that were originally within the target device gamut, in order to avoid
			hue shifts and discontinuities and to preserve as much as possible the
			overall appearance of the scene.
		<dt><dfn>saturation</dfn>
		<dd>
			This option was created to preserve the relative saturation (chroma) of the original,
			and to keep solid colors pure. However, it experienced interoperability problems like
			the perceptual intent, and as solid color preservation is not amenable to a reference
			medium solution using v4 profiles does not solve the problem. Use of this rendering intent
			is not recommended unless the specific source and destination profiles to be used have
			been checked to ensure the combination produces the desired result.
			This option should preserve the relative saturation (chroma) values of the original
			pixels. Out of gamut colors should be converted to colors that have the same saturation
			but fall just inside the gamut.

<h3 id="cal-cmyk">
	CSS and print: using calibrated CMYK and other printed colorspaces</h3>

The ''@color-profile'' at-rule is not restricted to RGB colorspaces.
While screens typically display colors directly in RGB,
printers often represent colors with CMYK.

Calibrated four color print with Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (CMYK),
or high-fidelity wide gamut printing with additional inks
such as Cyan Magenta Yellow Black Orange Green Violet (CMYKOGV)
can also be done in CSS,
provided you have an ICC profile
corresponding to the combination of
inks, paper, total ink coverage  and equipment
you will use.

<div class="example" id="ex-fogra">
	For example, using offset printing to ISO 12647-2:2004 / Amd 1:2007

	then gives the percentage
	of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.

Because the actual color resulting from a given CMYK combination is known,
an on-screen visualization of the printed output (soft-proof) can be made.
Also, procedures that rely on knowing the color
(anti-aliasing, compositing, using the color in a gradient, etc)
can proceed as normal.

	This example does not use illustrative swatches, because most of the colors are outside of sRGB.

	This CMYK color corresponds to lab(56.596645% -58.995875 28.072154)

	In sRGB this would be rgb(-60.568% 62.558% 32.390%) which,
	as the large negative red component shows,
	is out of gamut.

	Reducing the chroma until the result is in gamut
	gives lch(56.596645% 51 154.5533771086801)
	which is rgb(8.154% 60.9704% 37.184%)
	and this is used as the fallback color.

	For wide gamut screens, the color is inside the display-p3 gamut
	so no fallback need be specified.
	However, for the curious, the color is display-p3(0.1658 0.6147 0.3533).

<div class="example" id="ex-fogra55beta-7color">This example uses the beta FOGRA55 dataset for KCMYOGV seven-color printing.
	Four of the inks - black, cyan, magenta, and yellow - are the same as,

<h2 id='device-cmyk'>
Device-dependent CMYK Colors: the ''device-cmyk()'' function</h2>

	Sometimes, when a given printer has not been calibrated,
	but the output for particular ink combinations is known through experimentation,
	or via a printed sample swatchbook,
	it is useful to express CMYK colors
	in a device-dependent way.

	Note: because the actual resulting color may be unknown,
	CSS processors may attempt to approximate it.
	This approximation is likely to be visually very far from the actual printed result.

	The ''device-cmyk()'' function allows authors to specify a color in this way:

	<pre class='prod'>
		<dfn>device-cmyk()</dfn> = device-cmyk( <<cmyk-component>>{4} [ / <<alpha-value>> ]? , <<color>>? )
		<dfn>&lt;cmyk-component></dfn> = <<number>> | <<percentage>>
	</pre>

	The arguments of the ''device-cmyk()'' function specify the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black components, in order,
	as a number between 0 and 1 or a percentage between 0% and 100%.
	These two usages are equivalent, and map to each other linearly.
	Values less than 0 or 0%, or greater than 1 or 100%,
	are not invalid;
	instead, they are clamped to 0/0% or 1/100% at computed-value time.

	The fifth argument specifies the alpha channel of the color.
	It's interpreted identically to the fourth argument of the ''rgb()'' function.
	If omitted, it defaults to ''100%''.

	The sixth argument specifies the fallback color,
	used when the user agent doesn't know how to accurately transform the CMYK color to RGB.
	If omitted, it defaults to the CMYK color <a>naively converted to RGBA</a>.

	Typically, print-based applications will actually store the used colors as CMYK,
	and send them to the printer in that form.
	However, such colors do not have a colorimetric interpretation,
	and thus cannot be used in gradients, compositing, blending and so on.

	As such, Device CMYK colors must be converted to an equivalent color.
	This is not trivial, like the conversion from HSL or HWB to RGB;
	the precise conversion depends on the precise characteristics of the output device.

	<ol>
		<li>If the user, author, or user-agent stylesheet
			has an ''@color-profile'' definition for device-cmyk,
			and the resource specified by the src descriptor can be retrieved,
			and the resource is a valid CMYK ICC profile,
			and the user agent can process ICC profiles,
			the computed value of the ''device-cmyk()'' function
			must be the Lab value of the CMYK color.</li>
		<li>Otherwise, if a valid fallback color has been specified,
			the computed value of the ''device-cmyk()'' function
			must be that fallback color.</li>
		<li>Otherwise,
			the computed value of the ''device-cmyk()'' function must be
			the sRGB value of the CMYK color,
			as converted with the following naive conversion algorithm.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<div class='example' id="ex-device-cmyk-naive">
		For example, with no ''@color-profile'' and no fallback specified,
		the following colors are equivalent, using the naive conversion.

		<pre class="lang-css">

			color: <span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(178 34 34)"></span> firebrick;
		</pre>
	</div>

	<div class='example' id="ex-device-cmyk-colprof">
		With the ''@color-profile'' specified as in the example stylesheet,
		the following colors are equivalent, using colorimetric conversion.

	The naive conversion is necessarily approximate,
	since it has no knowledge of the colorimetry of the inks,
	the dot gain,
	the colorimetry of the RGB space, and so on.

<h2 id="transparency">
Transparency: the 'opacity' property</h2>

	Opacity can be thought of as a postprocessing operation.
	Conceptually, after the element (including its descendants) is rendered into an RGBA offscreen image,
	the opacity setting specifies how to blend the offscreen rendering into
	the current composite rendering.
	See <a href="#alpha">simple alpha compositing</a> for details.

	<pre class=propdef>
	Name: opacity
	Value: <<alpha-value>>
	Initial: 1
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: map to the range [0,1]
	Computed value: specified number, clamped to the range [0,1]
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	<wpt>
		opacity-overlapping-letters.html
		parsing/opacity-computed.html
		parsing/opacity-valid.html
		parsing/opacity-invalid.html
	</wpt>

	<dl>
		<dt><<alpha-value>>
		<dd>
			The opacity to be applied to the element.
			It is interpreted identically to its definition in ''rgb()'',
			except that the resulting opacity is applied to the entire element,
			rather than a particular color.
	</dl>

	The 'opacity' property applies the specified opacity to the element <em>as a whole</em>,
	including its contents,
	rather than applying it to each descendant individually.
	This means that, for example,
	an opaque child occluding part of the element's background will continue to do so even when 'opacity' is less than 1,
	but the element and child as a whole will show the underlying page through themselves.

	<!-- needs a code example and rendered result for those two cases -->

	It also means that the glyphs
	corresponding to all characters in the element
	are treated <em>as a whole</em>;
	any overlapping portions do not increase the opacity.

	<figure id="arabic-opacity-rendering">
		<img src="images/joining-and-transparency.svg"
		alt="overlapping glphs rendered correctly, and incorrectly">
		<figcaption>
			Correct and incorrect rendering of text
			with an 'opacity' value of less than one,
			whose glyphs overlap.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	If separate opacity for each glyph is desired,
	it can be achieved by using a color value
	which includes opacity,
	rather than setting the 'opacity' property.

	If a box has 'opacity' less than 1,
	it forms a <a>stacking context</a> for its children.
	(This prevents its contents from interleaving in the z-axis
	with content outside it.)

	Furthermore, if the 'z-index' property applies to the box,
	the ''z-index/auto'' value is treated as ''0'' for the element;
	it is otherwise painted on the same layer within its parent stacking context
	as positioned elements with stack level 0
	(as if it were a positioned element with ''z-index:0'').

	See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#layers">section 9.9</a>
	and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/zindex.html">Appendix E</a> of [[!CSS2]]
	for more information on stacking contexts.

	These rules about z-order do not apply to SVG elements,
	since SVG has its own <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/render.html">rendering model</a> ([[!SVG11]], Chapter 3).


<h3 id="alpha">
Simple alpha compositing</h3>

	When drawing, implementations must handle alpha

<h2 id="interpolation">
Interpolation</h2>

	Color interpolation happens with
	gradients,
	compositing,
	filters,
	transitions,
	animations, and
	color mixing and color modification functions.

	In general, interpolation between <<color>> values
	occurs by linearly interpolating each component of the computed value of the color
	separately, in Lab.

<!--

	Historically the existing specifications used interpolation in gamma-encoded sRGB.
	This gave poor results, and was sRGB-only.
	This specification improves the situation by

	- using a perceptually uniform interpolation space by default
	- enabling interpolation between any color
	  (which has a colorimetric interpretation, which is all of them except for device-cmyk and even then, only in corner cases)
	- allowing individual specifications to override this
	  (for example compositing should be in linear-light XYZ)
	  (for example, clor-mix defaults to LCH but allows other spaced to be explicitly specified)
	- maintaining Web compat with special-case where all the colors to be interpolated use legacy sRGB
	- providing an opt-in for sRGB colors

	The legacy specifications will over time be updated to add support for non-sRGB colors

	This is all in a comment because we don't make promises about future specifications

	But rest assured, they are all being targeted.

-->

	Interpolating to or from ''<color>/currentcolor'' is possible.
	The numerical value used for this purpose is the used value.

	ISSUE: Computed value needs to be able to represent
	combinations of ''currentColor'' and an actual color.
	Consider the value of 'text-emphasis-color' in
	<code>div { text-emphasis: circle; transition: all 2s; }<br>
	div:hover { text-emphasis-color: lime; }<br>
	em { color: red; }</code>
	See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/445">Issue 445</a>.

<h3 id="interpolation-space">
Color space for interpolation</h3>

	Issue: Should gamut mapping occur before or after interpolation?

	Colors are first converted to Lab
	and then interpolated as Lab colors.
	Host syntax can override the interpolation color space and specify which color space is used for interpolation.
	For example, 'color-mix' and 'color-adjust' override the default to LCH.

	The exception is that if all the <<color>>s to be interpolated
	are sRGB values, and they are all expressed in a legacy syntax
	such as hex colors, named colors,
	''rgb()'', ''hsl()'' or ''hwb()''
	(and the equivalent alpha-including forms)
	then they are interpolated in gamma-encoded sRGB space.

	This provides Web compatibility; legacy sRGB content interpolates in the sRGB space by default.

	This also means that authors can choose to opt-in to Lab interpolation
	by using the non-legacy ''color(srgb r g b)'' form.

<h3 id="interpolation-alpha">
Interpolating with alpha</h3>

	When the colors to be interpolated are not fully opaque,
	they are transformed into <dfn export>premultiplied color values</dfn>
	as follows:

	  *  For [=rectangular orthogonal color=] coordinate systems,
		 all component values are multiplied by the alpha value
	  *  For [=cylindrical polar color=] coordinate systems,
		 the hue angle is not premultiplied,
		 but the other two axes are premultiplied.

	To obtain a color value from a premultipled color value,
	each component which had been premultiplied
	is divided by the interpolated alpha value.

	<div class="example" id="ex-premultiplied-srgb">
		For example, to interpolate the two sRGB colors
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(24%, 12%, 98%, 0.4)"></span> rgb(24% 12% 98% / 0.4)
		and
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(62% 26% 64% / 0.6)"></span> rgb(62% 26% 64% / 0.6)
		they would first be converted to premultiplied form
		[9.6% 4.8% 39.2% ]
		and
		[37.2% 15.6% 38.4%]
		before interpolation.

		The midpoint of linearly interpolating these colors
		would be [23.4% 10.2% 38.8%]
		which, with an alpha value of 0.5,
		is <span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(46.8%, 21.4%, 77.6%, 0.5)"></span> rgb(46.8% 20.4% 77.6% / 0.5)
		when premultiplication is undone.
	</div>

	<div class="example" id="ex-premultiplied-lab">
		To interpolate two colors in lab
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(76%, 62%, 03%, 0.4)"></span> rgb(76% 62% 03% / 0.4)
		and
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(91.56%, 3.87%, 74.09%, 0.6)"></span> color(display-p3 0.84 0.19 0.72 / 0.6)
		they are first converted to lab
		<span class="swatch" style="--color: rgb(76%, 62%, 03%, 0.4)"></span> lab(66.927% 4.873 68.622 / 0.4)

		then the L, a and b coordinates are premultiplied before interpolation
		[26.771% 1.949 27.449]
		and
		[32.102% 49.603 -20.341].

		The midpoint of linearly interpolating these would be

<h3 id="hue-interpolation">
Hue interpolation</h3>

	Issue(4928): How to handle achromatic interpolation?

	For color functions with a hue angle (LCH, HSL, HWB etc), there are multiple ways to interpolate.
	We typically want to avoid arcs over 360 for the difference between the angles, as they are rarely desirable,
	so in most cases angles are fixed up prior to interpolation so that per-component interpolation is done over less than 360 degrees, often less than 180.

	Host syntax can specify any of the following algorithms for hue interpolation
	(angles in the following are in degrees, but the logic is the same regardless of how they are specified).

	Unless the type of hue interpolation is ''specified'', both angles need to be constrained to [0, 360) prior to interpolation.
	One way to do this is <code><i>θ</i> = ((<i>θ</i> % 360) + 360) % 360</code>.

	: ''shorter''
	:: Angles are adjusted so that θ₂ - θ₁ ∈ [-180, 180]. In pseudo-Javascript:
		<pre>
		if (θ₂ - θ₁ > 180) {
			θ₁ += 360;
		}
		else if (θ₂ - θ₁ < -180) {
			θ₂ += 360;
		}
		</pre>

	: ''longer''
	:: Angles are adjusted so that |θ₂ - θ₁| ∈ {0, [180, 360)}. In pseudo-Javascript:
		<pre>
		if (0 < θ₂ - θ₁ < 180) {
			θ₁ += 360;
		}
		else if (-180 < θ₂ - θ₁ < 0) {
			θ₂ += 360;
		}
		</pre>

	: ''increasing''
	:: Angles are adjusted so that θ₂ - θ₁ ∈ [0, 360). In pseudo-Javascript:
		<pre>
		if (θ₂ < θ₁) {
			θ₂ += 360;
		}
		</pre>

	: ''decreasing''
	:: Angles are adjusted so that θ₂ - θ₁ ∈ (-360, 0]. In pseudo-Javascript:
		<pre>
		if (θ₁ < θ₂) {
			θ₁ += 360;
		}
		</pre>

	: ''specified''
	:: No fixup is performed. Angles are interpolated in the same way as every other component.

	Unless otherwise specified, if no specific hue interpolation algorithm is selected by the host syntax, the default is ''shorter''.

	If one of the angles has the value NaN,
	then for interpolation, NaN is replaced
	by the value of the other hue angle.
	If both angles have the value NaN,
	then for interpolation, NaN is replaced
	by the value 0 for both angles.

	Issue(5277): How do these work when interpolating between multiple colors?

<h2 id="color-difference-code">Sample code for ΔE2000 color difference</h2>

<p>
	The simplest color difference metric, ΔE76,
	is simply the Euclidean distance in Lab colorspace.
	While this is a good first approximation,
	color-critical industries such as printing and fabric dyeing
	soon developed improved formulae.
	Currently, the most widely used formula
	is ΔE2000.
	It corrects a number of known asymmetries and non-linearities
	compared to ΔE76.
	Because the formula is complex,
	and critically dependent on the sign
	of various intermediate calculations,
	implementations are often incorrect [[Sharma]].

<p>
	The sample code below has been
	<a href="https://colorjs.io/tests/delta.html#deltae-2000">validated</a>

Appendix A: Deprecated CSS System Colors</h2>

	Earlier versions of CSS defined several additional [=system colors=].
	These color keywords have been <strong>deprecated</strong>, however,
	as they are insufficient for their original purpose

	represent a security risk
	by making it easier for a webpage to “spoof” a native OS dialog,
	and increase fingerprinting surface, compromising user privacy.

	User agents must support these keywords,

			consisting of space-separated arguments
			and an optional slash-separated opacity.
			All the color functions use this syntax form now,
			in keeping with <a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/functional-notation#general-principles">CSS's functional-notation design principles</a>.

		<li>All uses of <<alpha-value>> now accept <<percentage>> as well as <<number>>.

		<li>4 and 8-digit hex colors have been added, to specify transparency.
	</ol>

	Several brand new features have been added:

	<ol>

		<li>''hwb()'' function, for specifying colors in the HWB notation.

		<!-- <li>''color-mod()'' function, for manipulating colors. -->

		<li>predefined, wide color gamut RGB colorspaces</li>

		<li>''lab()'' and ''lch()'' functions, for device-independent color

		<li>''color()'' function and ''@color-profile'' at-rule, for profiled device-dependent color, including calibrated CMYK.

		<li>''device-cmyk()'' function, for specifying uncalibrated colors in an output-device-specific CMYK colorspace.

		<li>Serialization of <<color>> now specified here, rather than in CSS Object Model

		<li>Addition of named color ''rebeccapurple''.
	</ol>

Security and Privacy Considerations {#priv-sec}
===============================================

This specification defines "system" colors,
which theoretically can expose details of the user's OS settings,
which is a fingerprinting risk.

The system colors,
if they actually correspond to the user's system colors,
also pose a security risk,
as they make it easier for a malware site
to create user interfaces that appear to be from the system.
However, as several system colors are now defined to be "generic",
this risk is believed to be mitigated.

This specification adds to CSS the on-demand
downloading of ICC profiles.
These do not contain executable code,
and thus do not consitiute an increased security risk.


Accessibility Considerations {#a11y-sec}
========================================

This specification <a href="#notes">encourages authors to not use
	color alone</a> as a distinguishing feature.

This specification <a href="#css-system-colors">encourages browsers to ensure
	adequate contrast for specific system color foreground/background pairs</a>.
	A harder requirement with specific AA or AAA contrast ratios was considered,
	but since browsers are often just passing along color choices made by the OS,
	or selected by users (who may have particular requirements,
	including lower contrast for migraine or epilepsy sufferers), the CSSWG
	was unable to require a specific contrast level.
