Abstract: This module contains the features of CSS relating to new mechanisms of overflow handling in visual media (e.g., screen or paper).  In interactive media, it describes features that allow the overflow from a fixed size container to be handled by pagination (displaying one page at a time).  It also describes features, applying to all visual media, that allow the contents of an element to be spread across multiple fragments, allowing the contents to flow across multiple regions or to have different styles for different fragments.

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	<p>
		In CSS Level 1 [[CSS1]], placing more content than would fit
		inside an element with a specified size
		was generally an authoring error.
		Doing so caused the content to extend
		outside the bounds of the element,
		which would likely cause
		that content to overlap with other elements.
	</p>

	<p>
		CSS Level 2 [[CSS21]] introduced the 'overflow' property,
		which allows authors to have overflow be handled by scrolling,
		which means it is no longer an authoring error.
		It also allows authors to specify
		that overflow is handled by clipping,
		which makes sense when the author's intent
		is that the content not be shown.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, scrolling is not the only way
		to present large amounts of content,
		and may even not be the optimal way.
		After all, the codex replaced the scroll
		as the common format for large written works
		because of its advantages.
	</p>

	<p>
		This specification introduces
		a mechanism for Web pages to specify
		that an element of a page should handle overflow
		through pagination rather than through scrolling.
	</p>

	<p>
		This specification also extends the concept of overflow
		in another direction.
		Instead of requiring that authors specify a single area
		into which the content of an element must flow,
		this specification allows authors to specify multiple fragments,
		each with their own dimensions and styles,
		so that the content of the element can flow from one to the next,
		using as many as needed to place the content without overflowing.
	</p>

	<p>
		In both of these cases, implementations must
		break the content in the block-progression dimension.
		Implementations must do this is described
		in the CSS Fragmentation Module [[!CSS3-BREAK]].
	</p>

<h2 id="overflow-concepts">Types of overflow</h2>

	<p>
		CSS uses the term <dfn>overflow</dfn> to describe
		the contents of a box
		that extend outside that one of that box's edges
		(i.e., its <i>content edge</i>, <i>padding edge</i>,
		<i>border edge</i>, or <i>margin edge</i>).
		The overflow might be described as the elements or features
		that cause this overflow,
		the non-rectangular region occupied by these features,
		or, more commonly,
		as the minimal rectangle that bounds that region.
		A box's overflow is computed based on the boxes and styles
		of the box and of all its descendants whose containing block chain
		<span class="issue">undefined term?</span>
		includes the box.
	</p>

	<p>
		In most cases, any of these types of overflow
		can be computed for any box
		from the bounds and properties of that box,
		and from the overflow (of that type)
		of each of its children.
		However, this is not always the case; for example,
		when ''transform-style: preserve-3d'' [[CSS3-TRANSFORMS]] is used on
		some of the children, their descendants with
		''transform-style: preserve-3d'' must also be examined.
	</p>

<h3 id="ink-overflow">Ink overflow</h3>

	<p>
		The <dfn id="ink-overflow0">ink overflow</dfn> of a box
		is the part of that box and its contents that
		creates a visual effect outside of
		the box's border box.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since some effects in CSS (for example, the blurs in
		'text-shadow' [[CSS3TEXT]] and 'box-shadow' [[CSS3BG]])
		do not define what visual extent they cover, the extent
		of the <a>ink overflow</a> is undefined.
	</p>

	<p class="issue">
		Should we try to define it at all and just leave pieces undefined?
	</p>

	<p>
		The <dfn>ink overflow region</dfn> is the non-rectangular region
		occupied by the <a>ink overflow</a>, and the
		<dfn>ink overflow rectangle</dfn> is
		the minimal rectangle whose axis is aligned to the box's axes
		and contains the <a>ink overflow region</a>.
		Note that the <a>ink overflow rectangle</a> is a rectangle
		in the box's coordinate system, but might be non-rectangular
		in other coordinate systems due to transforms [[CSS3-TRANSFORMS]].
	</p>

<h3 id="scrollable-overflow">Scrollable overflow</h3>

	<p>
		The <dfn id="scrollable-overflow0">scrollable overflow</dfn> of a box is the
		set of things extending outside of that box's padding edge
		for which a scrolling mechanism needs to be provided.
	</p>

	<p class="issue">
		The following definition should be rewritten to use
		the concept of <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-transforms/#3d-rendering-context">3D rendering context</a> [[!CSS3-TRANSFORMS]]
		and related terms,
		particularly once those concepts stabilize following changes
		proposed in the CSS WG meeting on the morning of 2014-01-28.
	</p>

	<p>
		Given the following definitions
		<span class="issue">which belong in [[CSS3-TRANSFORMS]]</span>:
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn>3d-preserving child</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			A child box B of a containing block C is a 3d-preserving
			child if it has ''transform-style: preserve-3d''
			and the user-agent is not required to flatten it
			based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/#transform-style-property">requirements</a> in [[!CSS3-TRANSFORMS]].
		</dt>
		<dt><dfn>non-3d-preserving child</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			A child C of a box P is a non-3d-preserving-child if
			it is not a <a>3d-preserving child</a>.
		</dd>
		<dt><dfn>3d-preserving descendant</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Box D is a 3d-preserving descendant of box A if A is
			an ancestor of D, and D and all of the boxes (if any)
			in the containing block chain from D to A
			are <a>3d-preserving child</a> boxes.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>The scrollable overflow of a box is the union of the following things,
	all adjusted for transforms <span class="issue">undefined concept!</span> into the box's coordinate space:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			for the box and all of its <a>3d-preserving descendant</a> boxes:
			<ul>
				<li>the box's own padding edge (for the box itself) or border edge (for <a>3d-preserving descendant</a> boxes)</li>
				<li>the bounds <span class="issue">undefined term!</span> of any text directly in the box</li>
				<li><span class="issue">MORE HERE!</span>
			</ul>
		<li>
			for all the <a>non-3d-preserving child</a> boxes of the
			box and its <a>3d-preserving descendant</a> boxes,
			the scrollable overflow of the box
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="issue">
		I wrote this definition off the top of my head,
		so it can't possibly be right.
		It's missing tons of pieces!
	</p>

	<p class="issue">
		The handling of preserve-3d subtrees here is probably wrong;
		the elements should probably count
		only towards the overflow of the element that flattens them.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <dfn>scrollable overflow region</dfn> is the non-rectangular region
		occupied by the <a>scrollable overflow</a>, and the
		<dfn>scrollable overflow rectangle</dfn> is
		the minimal rectangle whose axis is aligned to the box's axes
		and contains the <a>scrollable overflow region</a>.
		Note that the <a>scrollable overflow rectangle</a> is a rectangle
		in the box's coordinate system, but might be non-rectangular
		in other coordinate systems due to transforms [[CSS3-TRANSFORMS]].
	</p>

<h3 id="border-box-overflow">Border box overflow</h3>

	<p class="issue">
		This concept has been proposed for some uses, such as for
		determining what the 'outline' property goes around, and
		as the basis of a coordinate system for specifying clips and masks,
		but it's not clear if it's needed.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <dfn>border-box overflow</dfn> of a box is the
		union of the box's border edge and the border edges of
		the box's descendants.</p>
	</p>

	<p class="issue">
		If needed, define more formally, as for scrollable overflow above.
		(Maybe even share the definitions in an appropriate way!)
	</p>

	<p>
		The <dfn>border-box overflow region</dfn> is the non-rectangular region
		occupied by the <a>border-box overflow</a>, and the
		<dfn>border-box overflow rectangle</dfn> is
		the minimal rectangle whose axis is aligned to the box's axes
		and contains the <a>border-box overflow region</a>.
		Note that the <a>border-box overflow rectangle</a> is a rectangle
		in the box's coordinate system, but might be non-rectangular
		in other coordinate systems due to transforms [[CSS3-TRANSFORMS]].
	</p>

<h2 id="overflow-properties">Overflow properties</h2>

	<p>
		The 'overflow-x' property specifies
		the handling of overflow in the horizontal direction
		(i.e., overflow from the left and right sides of the box),
		and the 'overflow-y' property specifies the handling
		of overflow in the vertical direction
		(i.e., overflow from the top and bottom sides of the box) 
	</p>

	<pre class=propdef>
		Name: overflow-x, overflow-y
		Value: ''visible'' | ''hidden'' | ''scroll'' | ''auto''
		Initial: ''visible''
		Applies to: block containers [[!CSS21]], flex containers [[!CSS3-FLEXBOX]], and grid containers [[!CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]]

		Media: visual
		Computed value: see below
		Animatable: no
		Canonical order: <abbr title="follows order of property value definition">per grammar</abbr>

	<p>
		The 'overflow' property is a shorthand property
		that sets the specified values of both 'overflow-x' and 'overflow-y'
		to the value specified for 'overflow'.

		and attempt to revive it,
		despite that implementations have implemented
		'overflow-x' and 'overflow-y' instead?
	</p>

<h2 id="fragmentation">Fragmentation of overflow</h2>

The 'continue' property gives authors the ability
to request that content that does not fit inside an element
be fragmented (in the sense of [[!CSS3-BREAK]]),
and provides alternatives
for where the remaining content should continue.

Notably, this property explains traditional pagination,
and extends it further.

	<pre class=propdef>
		Name: continue
		Value: ''next'' | ''overflow'' | ''paginate'' | ''fragments'' | ''discard''
		Initial: next
		Applies to: block containers [[!CSS21]], flex containers [[!CSS3-FLEXBOX]], and grid containers [[!CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]]
		Inherited: no
		Percentages: N/A
		Media: visual
		Computed value: see below
		Animatable: no
		Canonical order: <abbr title="follows order of property value definition">per grammar</abbr>
	</pre>

Issue: The naming of this property and its values is preliminary.
This was initially proposed as
"fragmentation: auto | none | break | clone | page"
in <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0357.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0357.html</a>,
and there is not yet wide agreement as to which naming is better.

Issue: This property is meant to generalize and replace 'region-fragment'.
Once it is sufficiently stable in this specification,
'region-fragment' should be removed from the regions specification in favor of this.

Note: ''continue: fragments'' replaces "overflow:fragments"
from earlier versions of this specification,
while ''continue: paginate'' replaces "overflow: paged-x | paged-y | paged-x-controls | paged-y-controls"

	<dl dfn-for="continue" dfn-type="value">
		<dt><dfn>next</dfn>
		<dd>Content that doesn't fit is pushed to the next region
		if the element is a <a spec="css-regions">CSS Region</a>
		other than the last one in a <a spec="css-regions">region chain</a>,
		or to the next page if the element is part of a page chain,
		or to the next <a>fragment box</a> if the element is a <a>fragment box</a>
		Otherwise, it overflows.

		<dt><dfn>overflow</dfn>
		<dd>Content that doesn't fit overflows, according to the 'overflow' property

		<dt><dfn>discard</dfn>
		<dd>Content that doesn't fit is discarded at a fragmentation break

		Note: generalized from region-fragment: break; on the last region of a region chain

		Issue: When the element isn't a <a spec="css-break">fragmentation container</a> already,
		should this work by turning it directly into one,
		or by creating a <a>fragment box</a> inside it like ''continue/fragments'' does?

		<dt><dfn>paginate</dfn>
		<dd>Content that doesn't fit paginates.
		This creates a paginated view inside the element
		similar to the way that 'overflow: scroll' creates a scrollable view.

		See <a href="#paginated-overflow">paginated overflow</a>

		Note: Print is effectively "continue: paginate" on the root.
		<dt><dfn>fragments</dfn>
		<dd>content that doesn't fit causes the element to copy itself and continue laying out.

		See <a href="#fragment-overflow">fragment overflow</a>.
	</dl>

The computed value of the 'continue' for a given element or pseudo element is determined as follow:
<ol>
	<li>If the specified value is ''continue/next''
	<ol>
		<li>On a <a spec="css-regions">CSS Region</a> other than the last one in a <a spec="css-regions">region chain</a>,
		the computed value is ''continue/next''
		<li>On a page
		the computed value is ''continue/paginate''
		<li>On a <a>fragment box</a>
		the computed value is ''continue/fragments''
		<li>Otherwise, the computed value is ''continue/overflow''
	</ol>
	<li>If the specified value is ''continue/framgents''
	<ol>
		<li>On a page
		the computed value is ''continue/paginate''
		<li>Otherwise, the computed value is the specified value
	</ol>
	<li>In all other cases, the computed value is the specified value
</ol>

Issue: If we introduce a pseudo element that can select columns in a multicol,
we would need to specify that next computes to next on it,
or introduce a new value and have next compute to that
(but what would that value compute to on things that aren't columns?).

Note: For background discussions leading to this property, see these threads:
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012May/1197.html">discussion of overflow, overflow-x, overflow-y and overflow-style</a> and
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0357.html">proposal for a fragmentation property</a>

<h2 id="paginated-overflow">Paginated overflow</h2>

This section introduces and defines the meaning of the ''continue/paginate'' value of the 'continue' property.

Issue: Write this section

Issue: Pages should be possible to style with @page rules. How does that work for nested pages?

<div class="issue">
Should traditional pagination (e.g. when printing)
be expressed through some magic in the computed value of ''continue: next'',
or by inserting this in the UA stylesheet:
<pre><code class="lang-css">
@media (overflow-block: paged), (overflow-block: optional-paged) {
	:root {
		continue: paginate;
	}
}
</code></pre>
</div>

Issue: Traditional pagination (e.g. when printing) assumes that
:root is contained in the page box,
rather than having the page box be a pseudo element child of :root.
Can we work around that using something similar to fragment boxes?
Or maybe by having a fragment box (reproducing :root) inside a page box inside :root?

Issue: How does the page box model work when it is a child of a regular css box?

Issue: The initial proposal in [[CSS3GCPM]] and implemantation from Opera
used 4 values instead of ''continue/paginate'':
"paged-x | paged-y | paged-x-controls | paged-y-controls".
Should this property also include these values,
or are they better handled as separate properties?
(e.g.: "pagination-layout: auto | horizontal | vertical", "pagination-controls: auto | none")

Issue: Ability to display N pages at once
rather than just one page at once?
Could this be a value of "pagination-layout", such as:
"pagination-layout: horizontal 2;"

	<p class="issue">
		The current implementation of paginated overflow uses
		the 'overflow'/'overflow-x'/'overflow-y' properties
		rather than the 'overflow-style' property as proposed
		in the [[CSS3GCPM]] draft
		(which also matches the [[CSS3-MARQUEE]] proposal).
		or the 'continue' property as described here.
	</p>

<h2 id="fragment-overflow">Fragment overflow</h2>

This section introduces and defines the meaning of
the ''continue/fragments'' value of the 'continue' property.

	<p>
		When the computed value of 'continue' for an element is ''continue/fragments'',
		and implementations would otherwise have created a box for the element,
		then implementations must create a sequence of <dfn>fragment box</dfn>es
		for that element.
		(It is possible for an element with ''continue: fragments''
		to generate only one <a>fragment box</a>.
		However, if an element's computed 'continue' is not ''continue/fragments'',
		then its box is not a <a>fragment box</a>.)
		Every <a>fragment box</a> is a fragmentation container,
		and any overflow
		that would cause that fragmentation container to fragment
		causes another <a>fragment box</a> created as a next sibling
		of the previous one.
		<span class="issue">Or is it as though it's a next sibling of
		the element?  Need to figure out exactly how this interacts with
		other box-level fixup.</span>
		Additionally, if the <a>fragment box</a> is also
		a multi-column box (as defined in [[!CSS3COL]]
		<span class="issue">though it defines <i>multi-column element</i></span>)
		any content that would lead to the creation of <a>overflow columns</a> [[!CSS3COL]]
		instead is flown into an additional fragment box.
		However, fragment boxes may themselves be broken
		(due to fragmentation in a fragmentation context outside of them,
		such as pages, columns, or other fragment boxes);
		such breaking leads to fragments of the same fragment box
		rather than multiple fragment boxes.
		(This matters because fragment boxes may be styled by their index;
		such breaking leads to multiple fragments of a fragment box
		with a single index.
		This design choice is so that
		breaking a fragment box across pages does not break
		the association of indices to particular pieces of content.)
		<span class="issue">Should a forced break that breaks to
		an outer fragmentation context cause a new fragment of a single
		fragment box or a new fragment box?</span>
		<span class="issue">Should we find a term other than
		<a>fragment box</a> here to make this a little less confusing?</span>
	</p>

	<p class="issue">
		What if we want to be able to style the pieces of an element
		split within another type of fragmentation context?
		These rules prevent ever using ''::nth-fragment()'' for that,
		despite that the name seems the most logical name for such a feature.
	</p>

	<div class="example">
		<table class="source-demo-pair"><tr><td><pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;

<h4 id="fragment-pseudo-element">The ::nth-fragment() pseudo-element</h4>

	<p>
		The <dfn selector>::nth-fragment()</dfn> pseudo-element
		is a pseudo-element
		that describes some of the <a>fragment box</a>es generated by an element.
		The argument to the pseudo-element takes the same syntax
		as the argument to the :nth-child() pseudo-class
		defined in [[!SELECT]], and has the same meaning
		except that the number is relative to
		<a>fragment box</a>es generated by the element
		instead of siblings of the element.
	</p>

	<p class="note">
		Selectors that allow addressing fragments
		by counting from the end rather than the start
		are intentionally not provided.
		Such selectors would interfere with determining
		the number of fragments.
	</p>

	<p class="issue">
		Depending on future discussions,
		this ''::nth-fragment(<var>an+b</var>)'' syntax
		may be replaced with
		the new ''::fragment:nth(<var>an+b</var>)'' syntax.

		Should this apply to continue:fragments only,

		for continue:paginate.)
	</p>

	<p>
		In the absence of rules with ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements,
		the computed style for each <a>fragment box</a>
		is the computed style for the element
		for which the <a>fragment box</a> was created.
		However, the style for a <a>fragment box</a> is also influenced
		by rules whose selector's <a>subject</a> [[!SELECT]]
		has an ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element,
		if the 1-based number of the <a>fragment box</a> matches
		that ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element
		and the selector (excluding the ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element)
		matches the element generating the fragments.
	</p>

	<p>
		When determining the style of the <a>fragment box</a>,
		these rules that match the fragment pseudo-element
		cascade together with the rules that match the element,
		with the fragment pseudo-element adding the specificity

		Styling an ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element with the 'continue'
		property does take effect;
		if a <a>fragment box</a> has a
		computed value of 'continue' other than ''fragments''
		then that fragment box is the last fragment.
		However, overriding 'continue' on the first fragment
		does not cause the <a>fragment box</a> not to exist;
		whether there are fragment boxes at all is determined by
		the computed value of overflow for the element.
	</p>

	<p>
		Styling an ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element with the 'content'
		property has no effect;
		the computed value of 'content' for the fragment box
		remains the same as the computed value of content for the element.
	</p>

	<p>
		Specifying ''display: none'' for a <a>fragment box</a> causes
		the fragment box with that index not to be generated.
		However, in terms of the indices
		used for matching ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements
		of later fragment boxes,
		it still counts as though it was generated.
		However, since it is not generated, it does not contain any content.
	</p>

	<p>
		Specifying other values of 'display', 'position',
		or 'float' is permitted, but is not allowed to change
		the computed value of 'display-inside'.
		(Since 'continue' only
		applies to block containers, flex containers, and grid containers
		the computed value of 'display-inside' is always
		''display-inside/block'', ''display-inside/flex'', or
		''display-inside/grid''.
		<span class="issue">Need to specify exactly how this works,
		but it depends on
		having 'display-inside' and 'display-outside' specified.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		To match the model for other pseudo-elements
		where the pseudo-elements live inside their corresponding element,
		declarations in ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements override
		declarations in rules without the pseudo-element.
		The relative priority within such declarations is determined
		by normal cascading order (see [[!CSS21]]).
	</p>

	<p>
		Styles specified on ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements
		do affect inheritance to content within the <a>fragment box</a>.
		In other words, the content within the <a>fragment box</a> must
		inherit from the fragment box's style (i.e., the pseudo-element style)
		rather than directly from the element.
		This means that elements split between fragment boxes may
		have different styles for different parts of the element.
	</p>

	<p class="issue">
		This inheritance rule allows specifying styles indirectly
		(by using explicit ''inherit'' or using default inheritance
		on properties that don't apply to ''::first-letter'')
		that can't be specified directly
		(based on the rules in the next section).
		This is a problem.
		The restrictions that apply to styling inside fragments
		should also apply to inheritance from fragments.

<h4 id="style-in-fragments">Styling inside fragments</h4>

	<p class="issue">
		Should this apply to continue:fragments only,
		or also to continue:paginate?
	</p>

	<p>
		The ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element
		can also be used to style
		content inside of a <a>fragment box</a>.
		Unlike the ''::first-line'' and ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements,
		the ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element can be applied
		to parts of the selector other than the subject:
		in particular, it can match ancestors of the subject.
		However, the only CSS properties applied
		by rules with such selectors
		are those that apply
		to the ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element.
	</p>

	<p>
		To be more precise,
		when a rule's selector has ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements
		attached to parts of the selector other than the subject,
		the declarations in that rule apply to
		a fragment (or pseudo-element thereof) when:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			the declarations are for properties that apply to the
			''::first-letter'' pseudo-element,
		</li>
		<li>
			the declarations would apply to
			that fragment (or pseudo-element thereof)
			had those ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements been removed,
			with a particular association between
			each sequence of simple selectors and the element it matched,
			and
		</li>
		<li>
			for each removed ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element,
			the fragment lives within a <a>fragment box</a>
			of the element associated in that association
			with the selector that the pseudo-element was attached to,
			and whose index matches the pseudo-element.
		</li>

<h3 id="max-lines">The 'max-lines' property</h3>

	<p>
		Authors may wish to style the opening lines of an element
		with different styles
		by putting those opening lines in a separate fragment.
		However, since it may be difficult to predict the exact height
		occupied by those lines
		in order to restrict the first fragment to that height,
		this specification introduces a 'max-lines' property
		that forces a fragment to break
		after a specified number of lines.
		This forces a break after the given number of lines
		contained within the element or its descendants,
		as long as those lines are in the same block formatting context.
