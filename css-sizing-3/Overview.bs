  Swap definition of preferred size in for max-content.
  Define current max-content as super-max-content.
  Mark an isssue about whether it's a necessary concept;
  I'm unsure, but I think it will show up in orthogonal flow sizing.

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	<p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

	<p>
		CSS layout has several different concepts of automatic sizing that are used in various layout calculations.
		This section defines some more precise terminology
		to help connect the layout behaviors of this spec to the calculations used in other modules,
		and some new keywords for the 'width' and 'height' properties
		to allow authors to assign elements the dimensions resulting from these size calculations.

<h3 id="placement">
Module interactions</h3>

	<p>This module extends the 'width', 'height', 'min-width', 'min-height', 'max-width', 'max-height', and 'column-width'
	features defined in [[!CSS2]] chapter 10 and in [[!CSS3COL]]

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	This specification follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]].
	Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values & Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification
	also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> keywords as their property value.
	For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

<h2 id="terms">
Terminology</h2>

	<dl export>
		<dt><dfn>size</dfn>
		<dd>
			A one- or two-dimensional measurement:
			a <a>block size</a> and/or <a>inline size</a>;
			alternatively a width and/or height.

		<dt><dfn>inner size</dfn>
		<dd>
			The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css2/box.html#box-dimensions">content-box</a> size of a <a>box</a>.
		<dt><dfn>outer size</dfn>
		<dd>
			The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css2/box.html#box-dimensions">margin-box</a> size of a <a>box</a>.

		<dt><dfn id="definite" lt="definite|definite size">definite size</dfn>
		<dd>
			A size that can be determined without performing layout;
			that is, a <<length>>,
			a measure of text (without consideration of line-wrapping),
			a size of the <a>initial containing block</a>,
			or a <<percentage>> or other formula
			(such the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#blockwidth">“stretch-fit” sizing of non-replaced blocks</a> [[CSS2]])
			that is resolved solely against <a>definite</a> sizes.

			Additionally, the size of the <a>containing block</a> of an absolutely positioned element is always <a>definite</a>
			with respect to that element.

		<dt><dfn id="indefinite" lt="indefinite|indefinite size">indefinite size</dfn>
		<dd>
			A size that is not <a>definite</a>.
			<a>Indefinite</a> <a>available space</a> is essentially infinite.

		<dt><dfn id="available" local-lt="available" lt="available space|available inline space|available block space">available space</dfn>
		<dd>
			A size representing the space into which a box is laid out,
			as determined by
			the rules of the formatting context in which it participates.
			The space available to a box is usually
			either a measurement of its <a>containing block</a> (if that is <a>definite</a>)
			or an infinite size (when it is <a>indefinite</a>).
			<a>Available space</a> can alternatively be either a
			<a>min-content constraint</a> or
			a <a>max-content constraint</a>.

<!--
			<p>
				The space <a>available</a> to a box is determined by the formatting context in which it participates.
				In block, table, and inline formatting contexts [[!CSS2]],
				the <a>available space</a> is infinite in the block-axis dimension.
				<span class="issue">What, exactly, is the available space in the inline axis??? What about other formatting models?</span>
-->

		<dt><dfn>stretch fit</dfn>
		<dd>
			The <a>stretch fit</a> into a given size
			is that size,
			minus the element's computed margins (not collapsed, treating ''margin/auto'' as zero),
			border, and padding in the given dimension
			(such that the outer size is a perfect fit),
			and flooring at zero
			(so that the inner size is not negative).

			<p class='note'>
				Note: This is the formula used to calculate the ''width/auto'' widths
				of non-replaced blocks in normal flow in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#blockwidth">CSS2.1§10.3.3</a>.

		<dt><dfn lt="fallback|fallback size">fallback size</dfn>
		<dd>
			Some sizing algorithms do not work well with an infinite size.
			In these cases, the <a>fallback size</a> is used instead.
			Unless otherwise specified,
			this is the size of the <a>initial containing block</a>.

			Note: For the <a>inline axis</a>, this is called the “available width” in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#float-width">CSS2.1§10.3.5</a>
			and computed by the rules in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#blockwidth">CSS2.1§10.3.3</a>.

		: <dfn lt="max-content | max-content size">max-content size</dfn>
		:: A box’s “ideal” <a>size</a> in a given axis when given infinite available space.
			Usually this is the smallest <a>size</a> the box could take in that axis
			while still fitting around its contents,
			i.e. minimizing unfilled space while avoiding overflow.

			: <dfn>max-content inline size</dfn>
			:: The box's “ideal” <a>size</a> in the <a>inline axis</a>.
				Usually the narrowest <a>inline size</a> it could take while fitting around its contents
				if <em>none</em> of the soft wrap opportunities within the box were taken.
				(See [[#intrinsic]].)

				Note: This is called the “preferred width” in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#float-width">CSS2.1§10.3.5</a>
				and the “maximum cell width” in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#auto-table-layout">CSS2.1§17.5.2.2</a>.

			: <dfn>max-content block size</dfn>

				Usually the <a>block size</a> of the content after layout.

		: <dfn lt="min-content | min-content size">min-content size</dfn>

				that could be avoided by choosing a larger <a>inline size</a>.
				Roughly, the <a>inline size</a> that would fit around its contents
				if <em>all</em> soft wrap opportunities within the box were taken.

				Note: This is called the “preferred minimum width” in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#float-width">CSS2.1§10.3.5</a>
				and the “minimum content width” in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#auto-table-layout">CSS2.1§17.5.2.2</a>.

			: <dfn>min-content block size</dfn>
			:: Equivalent to the <a>max-content block size</a>.

				Issue: Or should this be the minimum between allowed break points?
				It might make sense in multi-col contexts
				to have min-content and max-content block-sizes be different,
				even if they are the same elsewhere.

<h2 id='size-keywords'>
New Sizing Keywords</h2>

<h3 id='width-height-keywords'>
New Keywords for 'width' and 'height'</h3>

	<pre class=propdef partial>
	Name: width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, max-height
	New values: stretch | max-content | min-content | fit-content | fit-content(<<length-percentage>>)
	</pre>

	<p>There are four types of automatically-determined sizes in CSS (which
		are represented in the width and height properties by the keywords
		defined above):

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, max-height">
		<dt><dfn>stretch</dfn>
		<dd>
			Use the <a>stretch-fit inline size</a> or <a>stretch-fit block size</a>,
			as appropriate to the writing mode.

			NOTE: This is the formula used to calculate ''width/auto'' widths
			for non-replaced blocks in normal flow, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#blockwidth">CSS2.1§10.3.3</a>.
			It allows re-using this formula for boxes that are otherwise shrink-wrapped,
			like tables.

		<dt><dfn>max-content</dfn>
		<dd>
			If specified for the inline axis,
			use the <a>max-content inline size</a>;
			otherwise compute to the property’s <a>initial value</a>.

		<dt><dfn>min-content</dfn>
		<dd>
			If specified for the inline axis,
			use the <a>min-content inline size</a>;
			otherwise compute to the property’s <a>initial value</a>.

		<dt><dfn>fit-content</dfn>
		<dd>
			If specified for the inline axis,
			use the <a>max-content inline size</a>
			i.e.
			<code>min(<a>max-content size</a>, max(<a>min-content size</a>, <a>stretch-fit size</a>))</code>;
			otherwise compute to the property’s <a>initial value</a>.

		<dt><dfn>fit-content(<<length-percentage>>)</dfn>
		<dd>
			If specified for the inline axis,
			use the fit-content formula
			with the <a>available space</a> replaced by the specified argument,
			i.e.
			<code>min(<a>max-content size</a>, max(<a>min-content size</a>, <<length-percentage>>))</code>;
			otherwise compute to the property’s <a>initial value</a>.
	</dl>

	Issue: Is ''width/stretch'' stable enough or should we defer to L4?

	Note: To size an element such that it avoids overlapping sibling floats,
	make sure it's a <a>formatting context</a> root.
	For some layout modes, such as Grid and Flexbox,
	this is true automatically.
	For Block layout, this means using ''display: flow-root;''.

	Note: Percentages resolved against the intrinsic sizes
	(''width/max-content'', ''width/min-content'', ''width/fit-content'')
	will behave as ''width/auto''.
	<!-- <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#the-height-property">as defined by CSS 2</a>. [[!CSS2]] -->
	<!-- Restore the above when 2.1 is updated and published with the new "behaves as" text we resolved on. -->

	To have a common term for both when
	'width'/'height' computes to ''width/auto''
	and when it is defined to behave as ''width/auto''
	(as in the case above),
	the property is said to <dfn export lt="behave as auto|behaves as auto|behaving as auto">behave as auto</dfn>
	in both of these cases.

	Note: Legacy spec prose defining layout behavior
	might explicitly refer to 'width'/'height' having a computed value of ''width/auto'' as a condition;
	these should be interpreted as meaning <a>behaves as auto</a>,
	and reported to the CSSWG for updating.

<h3 id='the-contain-floats-value'>
Containing Floats</h3>

	Note: To ensure that a container sizes itself to contain any descendant floats,
	make sure it's a <a>formatting context</a> root.
	For some layout modes, such as Grid and Flexbox,
	this is true automatically.
	For Block layout, this means using ''display: flow-root;''.

<h3 id='column-sizing'>
Column Sizing Keywords</h3>

	<pre class="propdef partial">
	Name: column-width
	New values: stretch | max-content | min-content | fit-content | fit-content(<<length-percentage>>)
	</pre>

	<p>When  used as values for 'column-width',
		the new keywords specify the optimal column width:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="column-width">
		<dt><dfn>stretch</dfn>
		<dd>Specifies the optimal column width as the <a>stretch-fit inline size</a>
			of the multi-column element.

		<dt><dfn>max-content</dfn>
		<dd>Specifies the optimal column width as the <a>max-content inline size</a>
			of the multi-column element's contents.

		<dt><dfn>min-content</dfn>
		<dd>Specifies the optimal column width as the <a>min-content inline size</a>
			of the multi-column element's contents.

		<dt><dfn>fit-content</dfn>
		<dd>Specifies the optimal column width as

<h3 id='intrinsic-sizes'>
Intrinsic Sizes</h3>

	The <a>min-content size</a> of a box in each axis
	is the size it would have as an
	''width/auto''-sized (in that axis) float in a zero-sized containing block.
	(In other words, the minimum size it has when sized as “shrink-to-fit”.)

	The <a>max-content size</a> of a box in each axis
	is the size it would have as an
	''width/auto''-sized (in that axis) float in an infinitely-sized containing block.
	(In other words, the maximum size it has when sized as “shrink-to-fit”.)
	If this size would depend on the size of the containing block
	(as it does for images with an intrinsic aspect ratio but no intrinsic size)
	and therefore can't be calculated against an infinitely-sized containing block
	then:

	<dl>
		<dt>For boxes with an intrinsic aspect ratio, but no intrinsic size:
		<dd>
			* If the <a>available space</a> is <a>definite</a>
				in the <a>inline axis</a>,
				use the <a>stretch fit</a> into that size for the inline size
				and calculate the block size using the aspect ratio.
			* Otherwise
				use a width of <span class="issue">UNDEFINED</span>
				and calculate the height using the aspect ratio.
		<dt>For boxes without an intrinsic aspect ratio:
		<dd>
			* If the <a>available space</a> is <a>definite</a>
				in the appropriate dimension,
				use the <a>stretch fit</a> into that size in that dimension.
			* Otherwise,
				use ''300px'' for the width
				and/or ''150px'' for the height
				as needed.
	</dl>

	Note: This specification does not define how to determine
	the size of a float.
	Please refer to [[CSS2]],
	the relevant CSS specification for that display type,
	and/or existing implementations
	for further details.

<h3 id="intrinsic-contribution">
Intrinsic Contributions</h3>

	A box’s <a>min-content contribution</a>/<a>max-content contribution</a> in each axis
	is the size of the content box
	of a hypothetical ''width/auto''-sized float
	that contains only that box,
	if that hypothetical float's containing block is zero-sized/infinitely-sized.

	However, in the case of a [=replaced element|replaced=] box with a percentage-based 'width'/'max-width'/'height'/'max-height',
	the percentage is resolved to zero
	when calculating the <a>min-content contribution</a> in the corresponding axis.

	<div class=example>
		For example,
		an <{input}> assigned ''width: calc(50% + 50px)''
		has a <a>min-content contribution</a> of ''50px'',
		plus any horizontal margin/border/padding.
	</div>

	Note: We are not 100% sure if zeroing out a percentage 'max-width' on form controls is web-compatible.
	See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/765">Issue 765</a>.

	Note: This specification does not define how to determine these sizes.
	Please refer to [[CSS2]],
	the relevant CSS specification for that display type,
	and/or existing implementations
	for further details.

<h2 id='extrinsic'>
Extrinsic Size Determination</h2>

	<p>
		<dfn export>Extrinsic sizing</dfn> determines sizes based on the context of an element,
		without regard for its contents.

<h3 id="stretch-fit-sizing">
Stretch-fit Sizing</h3>

		The inner <a>stretch-fit inline size</a> of a box is&hellip;

		<!-- Based on https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Nov/0286.html -->

		<ul>
			<li>
				If the box is the root or is absolutely-positioned, the inline-size of its containing block, else
			<li>
				<code>max('min-inline-size'|0, min('max-inline-size'|infinity, 'inline-size'|<a>stretch-fit inline size</a>))</code>
				where the sizes are inner inline-sizes of the element establishing the box's <a>containing block</a>,
				and where the first value is used if it is <a>definite</a> and the second value otherwise.
		</ul>


		&hellip;less the box's <a>inline-axis</a> margins
		(after any <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins">margin collapsing</a>, and treating ''margin/auto'' margins as zero),
		borders, and padding,
		flooring at zero.

		Issue: Shouldn't this be ignoring margin collapsing?

	<p>
		The <a>stretch-fit block size</a> of a box is defined analogously,
		but in the other dimension.

	<p class='issue'>
		This definition might end up skipping further up the ancestor chain than we'd like in some cases.
		<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Oct/0204.html">Example.</a>
		Maybe it should stop at each formatting root, or something similar?

<h3 id="percentage-sizing">
	Percentage Sizing</h3>

	Percentages specify sizing of a box with respect to the box’s <a>containing block</a>.
	When calculating the <a>intrinsic size contribution</a> of the box,
	percentage sizes that would resolve against that box instead behave as ''width/auto''.

	<div class="example">
		For example, in the following markup:

		<pre class='lang-html'>
			&lt;div style="width: min-content">
				&lt;div style="width: 50%;">
					LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG
				&lt;/div>
			&lt;/div>
		</pre>

		When calculating the width of the outer div,
		the inner div behaves as ''width: auto'',
		so the outer div sets itself to the width of the long word.
		Since the outer div's width didn't depend on "real" layout,
		though, it's treated as <a>definite</a>
		for resolving the inner div,
		whose width resolves to half that of the outer div.
	</div>

	Although this may require an additional layout pass to re-resolve percentages in some cases,
	a 'min-width' or 'min-height'
	with a value of ''min-width/min-content'', ''min-width/max-content'', ''min-width/fit-content'',
	or ''min-width/auto'' (or otherwise <a>behaving as auto</a>)
	does not prevent the resolution of percentage sizes of the box’s contents.

	In order to prevent cyclic sizing in the general case,
	percentages do not otherwise resolve against <a>indefinite</a> sizes,
	and instead are treated as <css>auto</css>.

	<div class="issue">
		We think the above paragraphs can be more accurately replaced by:

		<blockquote>
			For the purpose of calculating the <a>intrinsic size contribution</a> of a box,
			an intrinsic 'min-width', 'min-height', or 'inline-size' cause the box's width/height to be treated as indefinite
			(and thus percentages that resolve against it behave as <css>auto</css>).

			Although this may require an additional layout pass to re-resolve percentages in some cases,
			a 'min-width', 'min-height', or 'inline-size'
			with a value of ''min-width/min-content'', ''min-width/max-content'', ''min-width/fit-content'',
			or ''min-width/auto'' (or otherwise <a>behaving as auto</a>)
			does not prevent the resolution of percentage sizes of the box’s contents.
		</blockquote>

		...but we're not 100% sure.
