Introduction {#intro}
=====================

This specification provides features to control sizes of CSS objects
according to the rules desired by use cases.

Controlling sizes of CSS objects to be multiple of a unit
is desired in many cases.
This level of the specification focuses on following cases.

* Adjust heights of line boxes to the multiple of the specified unit.
* Adjust widths of block-level boxes to the multiple of the specified unit.

By controlling heights of line boxes,
lines of text in different fonts can create consistent visuals
to help readability.

Also by stacking such line boxes,
authors can align lines across columns,
pages, scroll-snapped blocks, or multiple blocks placed absolutely,
to produce vertical rhythm.

<div class="figure">
<a href="examples/snap-height.html">
<img src="images/snap-height-sample.png"></a>
<p class="caption">Vertical rhythm kept through pictures and different size of text in a multi-column document.
</div>

Controlling widths of block-level boxes to the multiple of the specified unit
gives the ability to control a block
so that it can fit mono-space characters
without remainders.
One of the use cases this feature addresses is
better readability of East Asian documents.
In Han ideographic-based scripts such as Chinese or Japanese,
most characters have 1em advance,
and due to that nature, most such documents are justified.

Adjusting widths of block-level boxes to the multiple of 1em helps to
minimize cases where justification needs to expand spacing.

Adjusting Line Box Heights: the 'line-height-step' property {#line-height-step}
===============================================================================

<pre class='propdef'>
  Name: line-height-step
  Value: <<length>>
  Initial: 0px
  Applies to: block containers
  Inherited: yes
  Animatable: no
  Percentages: N/A
  Media: visual
  Computed Value: the absolute length for length
</pre>

This property defines the <dfn>step unit</dfn> for line box heights.
Non-negative <<length>>s are valid.

When the <a>step unit</a> is set to a positive <<length>>,
the line box heights are rounded <i>up</i> to
the closest multiple of the unit.

The additional space is distributed to
<a>over</a>-side and <a>under</a>-side of the line box equally,
so that the original line box appears at the center of the
multiple of <a>step unit</a>.

[[!CSS21]] <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visudet.html#line-height">&#xA7;10.8 Line height calculations</a>
defines how to compute the line box height
after the line box was constructed from inline-level boxes.
The rounding is applied to the computed line box height
by assuming that there is an inline-level box that has adjusted A' and D'
in the line box.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="images/adjust-line-height.svg">
  <p class="caption">Rounding up the computed line box height.
</div>

<div class="example">
  <div class="figure" style="float:right">
    <img src="images/line-grid-center.svg"
      style="height: 300px"
      >
  </div>

  In the following example,
  the height of line box in each paragraph is rounded up to the <a>step unit</a>.

  <pre class="lang-css">
  :root {
    font-size: 12pt;
    --my-grid: 18pt;
    line-height-step: var(--my-grid);
  }
  h1 {
    font-size: 20pt;
    margin-top: calc(2 * var(--my-grid));
  }
  p {
    margin: 0;
  }
  </pre>

  The line box in <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> does not fit into one <a>step unit</a>
  and thus occupies two,
  but it is still centered within the two <a>step unit</a>.
</div>

<div class="example">
  Authors can keep margins or other properties to be multiple of <a>step unit</a>
  using ''var()'' and ''calc()'' as in the example above.

  If author prefers,
  tools like Sass can make such declarations shorter.

  <pre class="lang-css">
    $gu: 18px;

    @function gu($n) {
      @return $n * $gu;
    }

    h1 {
      font-size: 20pt;
      margin: gu(1.2) auto gu(1.8);
    }
  </pre>
</div>

<div class="note">
It is usually recommended to set the 'line-height' lower than
the <a>step unit</a>.
The used line height can increase due to several factors such as
the use of 'vertical-align' or font fallback.
</div>

Notes on Block-level Boxes {#block-height}
------------------------------------------

<i>This section is not normative.</i>

This level of the specification does not provide features
to adjust heights of block-level boxes.

<div class="example">
  The following CSS turns <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> to inline-blocks,
  so that the 'line-height-step' property can control its height.

  <pre class="lang-css">
  :root {
    line-height-step: 18pt;
  }
  h2 {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 100%;
    line-height-step: 0;
    line-height: 1.2;
  }
  </pre>

  When an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> is long enough to wrap,
  text inside the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> uses ''line-height: 1.2'', while
  the height of the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> block is rounded up
  to the multiple of ''18pt''.
  See <a href="examples/snap-height.html">a sample in action</a>.
</div>
