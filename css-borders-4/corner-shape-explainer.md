# Shaping Corners

## The user need
Squircles, and other shaped corners, have been [sought after](https://www.figma.com/blog/desperately-seeking-squircles/) in the web
for quite a while.

[Native platforms](https://blog.minimal.app/rounded-corners-in-the-apple-ecosystem/) have had different versions of them for a long time,
and they have been a common design in the design ecosystem, everywhere except for in the web platform.

## The solution
To allow for these designs, CSS enhances the existing concept of `border-radius`, by allowing the author to specify how convex/concave
the shape of the corner should be, alongside its radii.

The `corner-shape` property accepts any value between `notch` (fully concave) and `square` (full convex), using the `superellipse()` function.
Designers can choose the shape of the corner that they fancy, and also animate between different corner shapes.

Borders and shadows are also shaped according to the given `corner-shape`.

## Why "corners"?
Alternatively to using the concept of corners, there was an option to use free-form shapes as borders.
This is expressed in a separate proposal (`border-shape`). However, by extending the concept of corners the web platform allows
this type of shaping to be a progressive enhancement on top of existing `border-radius`, as well as giving a relatively simple tool
for shaping the corners rather than overloading everything on top of a general purpose shaping power tool.

In addition, when constraining the problem to "corners", we can lift other constraints that exist on general-purpose shapes: for example,
border styles are renderable because the edge-cases are more manageable.
