Draft:    https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-css-contain-1-20170221/
Title:    CSS Contain Level 1

Comment: As the publication of the FPWD of this specification was significantly delayed
compared to when the group agreed to publish, this disposition of comments
goes back further in time than the actual publication as an FPWD.

Comments about the very early Editor Drafts are not included as they are more
of a collaborative design phase than reviews, but comments there after are included.
