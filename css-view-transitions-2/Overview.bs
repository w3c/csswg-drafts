# Introduction # {#intro}

	*This section is non-normative.*

	View Transitions, as specified in [[css-view-transitions-1]], is a feature that allows developers
	to create animated transitions between visual states of the [=/document=].

	Level 2 extends that specification, by adding the necessary API and lifecycle to enable
	transitions across a same-origin cross-document navigation.


## Lifecycle ## {#lifecycle}

	*This section is non-normative.*

	A successful cross-document view transition goes through the following phases:

	1. The user navigates, by clicking a link, submitting a form, traversing history using the
		browser UI, etc.

	1. Once it's time to [=unload=] the old document, if the navigation is [=same origin=]
		and the old {{Document}} has opted in to cross-document view-transitions, the old state is captured.

	1. An event named {{Window/pagereveal}} is fired on the new {{Document}}, with a `viewTransition` property,
		which is a {{ViewTransition}} object. This {{ViewTransition}}'s <code>{{ViewTransition/updateCallbackDone}}</code> is already resolved,
		and its [=captured elements=] are populated from the old {{Document}}.

	1. Right before the new {{Document}} has the first [=rendering opportunity=], its state is captured as
		the "new" state.

	1. From this point forward, the transition continues as if it was a same-document transition, as per [=activate view transition=].

## Examples ## {#examples}

### Cross-document view-transitions ### {#cross-doc-example}

	<div class=example>
		To generate the same cross-fade as in the first example [[css-view-transitions-1#examples]],
		but across documents, we don't need JavaScript.

		Instead, we opt in to triggering view-transitions on navigation in both page 1 and page 2:

		```css
		// in both documents:
		@view-transition {
			navigation: auto;
		}
		```

		A link from page 1 to or from page 2 would generate a crossfade transition for example 1.
		To achieve the effect examples 2, 3 & 4, simply put the CSS for the pseudo-elements in both
		documents.
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		To achieve the effect in [[css-view-transitions-1#examples|example 5]], we have to do several
		things:

		- Opt-in to navigation-triggered view-transitions in both pages.
		- Pass the click location to the new document, e.g. via {{WindowSessionStorage/sessionStorage}}.
		- Intercept the {{ViewTransition}} object in the new document, using the {{Window/pagereveal}} event.

		In both pages:
		```css
		@view-transition {
			navigation: auto;
		}

		```

		In the old page:
		```js
		addEventListener('click', event => {
			sessionStorage.setItem("lastClickX", event.clientX);
			sessionStorage.setItem("lastClickY", event.clientY);
		});
		```

		In the new page:
		```js
		// This would run both on initial load and on reactivation from BFCache.
		addEventListener("pagereveal", async event => {
			if (!event.viewTransition)
				return;

			const x = sessionStorage.getItem("lastClickX") ?? innerWidth / 2;
			const y = sessionStorage.getItem("lastClickY") ?? innerHeight / 2;

			const endRadius = Math.hypot(
				Math.max(x, innerWidth - x),
				Math.max(y, innerHeight - y)
			);

			await event.viewTransition.ready;

			// Animate the new document's view
			document.documentElement.animate(
				{
					clipPath: [
						`circle(0 at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
						`circle(${endRadius}px at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
					],
				},
				{
					duration: 500,
					easing: 'ease-in',
					pseudoElement: '::view-transition-new(root)'
				}
			);
		})
		```
	</div>

### 'view-transition-class' ### {#vt-class-example}

view-transition-class provides a way to use the same style
for multiple view transition pseudo elements without having to replicate the corresponding pseudo-elements.

	<div class="example">
	This example creates a transition with each box participating under its own name, while applying
	a 1-second duration to the animation of all the boxes:

	```html
	<div class="box" id="red-box"></div>
	<div class="box" id="green-box"></div>
	<div class="box" id="yellow-box"></div>
	```

	```css
	div.box {
		view-transition-class: any-box;
		width: 100px;
		height: 100px;
	}
	#red-box {
		view-transition-name: red-box;
		background: red;
	}
	#green-box {
		view-transition-name: green-box;
		background: green;
	}
	#yellow-box {
		view-transition-name: yellow-box;
		background: yellow;
	}

	/* The following style would apply to all the boxes, thanks to 'view-transition-class' */
	::view-transition-group(*.any-box) {
		animation-duration: 1s;
	}
	```

	</div>


# CSS Properties # {#css-properties}

## Applying the same style to multiple participating elements: the 'view-transition-class' property ## {#view-transition-class-prop}

	<pre class=propdef>
	Name: view-transition-class
	Value: none | <<custom-ident>>*
	Initial: none
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: n/a
	Computed Value: as specified
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	The 'view-transition-class' can be used to apply the same style rule to multiple [=named view transition pseudo-elements=] which may have a different 'view-transition-name'.
	While 'view-transition-name' is used to match between the element in the old state with its corresponding element in the new state, 'view-transition-class' is used
	only to apply styles using the view-transition pseudo-elements
	(''::view-transition-group()'', ''::view-transition-image-pair()'', ''::view-transition-old()'', ''::view-transition-new()'').

	Note that 'view-transition-class' by itself doesn't mark an element for capturing, it is only used as an additional
	way to style an element that already has a 'view-transition-name'.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=view-transition-class>
		: <dfn>none</dfn>
		:: No class would apply to the [=named view transition pseudo-elements=] generated for this element.

		: <dfn><<custom-ident>>*</dfn>
		:: All of the specified <<custom-ident>> values (apart from <css>none</css>) are applied when used in [=named view transition pseudo-element=] selectors.
			<css>none</css> is an invalid <<custom-ident>> for 'view-transition-class', even when combined with other <<custom-ident>>s.

			Note: If the same 'view-transition-name' is specified for an element both in the old and new states of the transition,
			only the 'view-transition-class' values from the new state apply. This also applies for cross-document view-transitions:
			classes from the old document would only apply if their corresponding 'view-transition-name' was not specified in the new document.
	</dl>

# Pseudo-classes # {#pseudo-classes}

## Active View Transition Pseudo-class '':active-view-transition()''' ## {#the-active-view-transition-pseudo}

The <dfn id='active-view-transition-pseudo'>:active-view-transition(<<vt-type-selector>>)</dfn> pseudo-class applies to the root element of the document, if it has a matching [=active view transition=].
It has the following syntax definition:

<pre class=prod>
	:active-view-transition(<<vt-type-selector>>)
	<dfn>&lt;vt-type-selector></dfn> = '*' | <<custom-ident>>#
</pre>

The [=specificity=] of an '':active-view-transition()'' is one pseudo-class selector if it has value is ''*'', and two if it has any other value.

An '':active-view-transition()'' pseudo-class matches the [=document element=] when it has an non-null [=active view transition=] |viewTransition|, for which any of the following are true:

* The <<vt-type-selector>> is ''*''
* |viewTransition|'s [=ViewTransition/active types=] [=list/contains=] at least one of the <<custom-ident>> values of the <<vt-type-selector>>.

<div class=example>
For example, the developer might start a transition in the following manner:
```js
document.startViewTransition({update: updateTheDOMSomehow, types: ["slide-in", "reverse"]});
```

This will activate any of the following ':active-view-transition()'' selectors:
```css
:root:active-view-transition(slide-in) {}
:root:active-view-transition(reverse) {}
:root:active-view-transition(slide-in, reverse) {}
:root:active-view-transition(slide-in, something-else) {}
:root:active-view-transition(*) {}
```

While starting a transition without selecting transition types, would only activate ':active-view-transition()'' with ''*'':

```js
document.startViewTransition(updateTheDOMSomehow);
// or
document.startViewTransition({update: updateTheDOMSomehow});
```

```css
/* This would be active */
:root { }
:root:active-view-transition(*) {}

/* This would not be active */
:root:active-view-transition(slide-in) {}
:root:active-view-transition(any-type-at-all-except-star) {}
```
</div>

# Additions to named view-transition pseudo-elements # {#pseudo-element-additions}

	The [=named view transition pseudo-elements=]
	(''view-transition-group()'', ''view-transition-image-pair()'', ''view-transition-old()'', ''view-transition-new()'')
	are extended to support the following syntax:

	<pre class=prod>
		::view-transition-group(<<pt-name-selector>><<pt-class-selector>>)
		::view-transition-image-pair(<<pt-name-selector>><<pt-class-selector>>)
		::view-transition-old(<<pt-name-selector>><<pt-class-selector>>)
		::view-transition-new(<<pt-name-selector>><<pt-class-selector>>)
	</pre>

	where <<pt-name-selector>> works as previously defined, and
	<<pt-class-selector>> has the following syntax definition:

	<pre class=prod>
		<dfn>&lt;pt-class-selector></dfn> = ['.' <<custom-ident>>]*
	</pre>

	A [=named view transition pseudo-element=] [=selector=] which has one or more <<custom-ident>> values
	in its <<pt-class-selector>> would only match an element if the [=captured element/class list=] value in
	[=ViewTransition/named elements=] for the pseudo-element's 'view-transition-name' [=list/contains=] all of those values.

	The specificity of a [=named view transition pseudo-element=] [=selector=]
	with a <<pt-class-selector>>
	is equivalent to a [=class selector=] with the equivalent number of classes.

# CSS rules # {#css-rules}

## The <dfn id="at-view-transition-rule">''@view-transition''</dfn> rule ## {#view-transition-rule}

The ''@view-transition'' rule is used by a document to indicate that cross-document navigations
should setup and activate a {{ViewTransition}}. To take effect, it must be present in the old document
when unloading, and in the new document when the {{Window/pagereveal}} is fired.


## @view-transition rule grammar ## {#view-transition-grammar}

The ''@view-transition'' rule has the following syntax:

<pre class=prod>
	@view-transition {
		<<declaration-list>>
	}
</pre>

Note: as per default behavior, the ''@view-transition'' rule can be nested inside a
[=conditional group rule=] such as ''@media'' or ''@supports''.

## The [=@view-transition/navigation=] descriptor ## {#view-transition-navigation-descriptor}

	<pre class='descdef'>
	Name: navigation
	For: @view-transition
	Value: auto | none
	Initial: none
	</pre>

	The '<dfn for="@view-transition">navigation</dfn>' descriptor opts in to automatically starting a view transition when performing a navigation of a certain type.
	It needs to be enabled both in the old document (when unloading) and in the new document (when reveal).

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@view-transition/navigation">
		: <dfn>none</dfn>
		:: There will be no transition.

		: <dfn>auto</dfn>
		:: The transition will be enabled if the navigation is same-origin, without cross-origin
			redirects, and whoes {{NavigationType}} is
			* {{NavigationType/traverse}} or
			* {{NavigationType/push}} or {{NavigationType/replace}} with <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#user-navigation-involvement">user navigation involvement</a> not equal to `"browser UI"`.

			Note: Navigations excluded from ''@view-transition/navigation/auto'' are for example, navigating
			via the URL address bar or clicking a bookmark, as well as any form of user or script initiated {{NavigationType/reload}}.

	</dl>

## The [=@view-transition/type=] descriptor ## {#view-transition-type-descriptor}

	<pre class='descdef'>
	Name: type
	For: @view-transition
	Value: none | <<custom-ident>>*
	Initial: none
	</pre>

	The '<dfn for="@view-transition">type</dfn>' descriptor sets the [=ViewTransition/active types=] for the transition
	when capturing and performing the transition, equivalent to calling {{Document/startViewTransition(callbackOptions)}} with that {{StartViewTransitionOptions/type}}.

# API # {#api}

## Additions to {{Document}} ## {#additions-to-document-api}

	<xmp class=idl>
		dictionary StartViewTransitionOptions {
			UpdateCallback? update = null;
			sequence<DOMString>? type = null;
		};

		partial interface Document {

			ViewTransition startViewTransition(optional (UpdateCallback or StartViewTransitionOptions) callbackOptions = {});
		};
	</xmp>

### {{Document/startViewTransition(callbackOptions)}} Method Steps ### {#ViewTransition-start-with-options}

	<div algorithm="start-vt-with-options">
		The [=method steps=] for <dfn method for=Document>startViewTransition(|callbackOptions|)</dfn> are as follows:

		1. Let |updateCallback| be null.

		1. If |callbackOptions| is an an {{UpdateCallback}}, set |updateCallback| to |callbackOptions|.

		1. Otherwise, if |callbackOptions| is a {{StartViewTransitionOptions}}, then set |updateCallback| to |callbackOptions|'s {{StartViewTransitionOptions/update}}.

		1. If |this|'s [=active view transition=] is not null and its [=outbound post-capture steps=] is not null,
			then:

			1. Let |preSkippedTransition| be a new {{ViewTransition}} in |this|'s [=relevant realm=] whose [=ViewTransition/update callback=] is |updateCallback|.

			1. [=Skip the view transition|Skip=] |preSkippedTransition| with an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.

			1. Return |preSkippedTransition|.

		1. Let |viewTransition| be the result of running the [=method steps=] for {{Document/startViewTransition(updateCallback)}} given |updateCallback|.

		1. If |callbackOptions| is a {{StartViewTransitionOptions}}, then set |viewTransition|'s [=ViewTransition/active types=] to |callbackOptions|'s {{StartViewTransitionOptions/type}}.

		1. Return |viewTransition|.
	</div>

## Extensions to the <code>CSSRule</code> interface</h3> ## {#extensions-to-cssrule-interface}

The <code>CSSRule</code> interface is extended as follows:

<pre class='idl'>
partial interface CSSRule {
	const unsigned short VIEW_TRANSITION_RULE = 15;
};
</pre>

## The <code>CSSViewTransitionRule</code> interface</h3> ## {#navgation-behavior-rule-interface}

The {{CSSViewTransitionRule}} represents a ''@view-transition'' rule.

<xmp class=idl>
		enum ViewTransitionNavigation { "auto", "none" };
		[Exposed=Window]
		interface CSSViewTransitionRule : CSSRule {
			attribute ViewTransitionNavigation navigation;
			attribute DOMTokenList type;
		};
</xmp>


# Algorithms # {#algorithms}
## Data Structures ## {#concepts}

### Additions to {{Document}} ### {#additions-to-document}
	A {{Document}} additionaly has:

	<dl dfn-for=document>
		: <dfn>inbound view transition params</dfn>
		:: a [=view transition params=], or null.
			Initially null.
	</dl>

### The View transition params struct ### {#view-transition-params-struct}

	A <dfn>view transition params</dfn> is a [=struct=] whose purpose is to serialize view transition information across documents.
	It has the following [=struct/items=]:

	<dl dfn-for="view transition params">
		: <dfn>named elements</dfn>
		:: a [=/map=], whose keys are strings and whose values are [=captured elements=].

		: <dfn>initial snapshot containing block size</dfn>
		:: a [=tuple=] of two numbers (width and height).
	</dl>

### Additions to {{ViewTransition}} ### {#view-transitions-extension}

	A {{ViewTransition}} additionally has:
	<dl dfn-for=ViewTransition>
		: <dfn>outbound post-capture steps</dfn>
		:: Null or a set of steps, initially null.

		: <dfn>active types</dfn>
		:: Null or a [=list=] of strings, initially null.
	</dl>

### Additions to [=captured element=] struct ### {#additions-to-captured-element-struct}

The [=captured element=] struct should contain these fields, in addition to the existing ones:

	<dl>
		: <dfn for="captured element">class list</dfn>
		:: a [=/list=] of strings, initially empty.
	</dl>

## Algorithm to capture 'view-transition-class': ## {#vt-class-algorithms}
<div algorithm="additional capture steps">
When capturing the old or new state for an element, perform the following steps given a [=captured element=] |capture| and an [=element=] |element|:

	1. Set |capture|'s [=captured element/class list=] to the [=computed value=] of |element|'s 'view-transition-class'.

	Note: This is written in a monkey-patch manner, and will be merged into the algorithm once the L1 spec graduates.
</div>

## Additions to skip steps: ## {#additional-skip-steps}
<div algorithm="additional skip steps">
Append the following steps to [=skip the view transition=] given a {{ViewTransition}} |transition|:
	1. If |transition|'s [=outbound post-capture steps=] is not null, then run |transition|'s [=outbound post-capture steps=] with null.

	Note: This is written in a monkey-patch manner, and will be merged into the algorithm once the L1 spec graduates.
</div>

## Addition to pending transition operations ## {#additions-to-pending-transition-operation}

Prepend this to the [=Perform pending transition operations=] algorithm given a {{Document}} |document|:
	1. If |document|'s [=active view transition=] is not null and its [=outbound post-capture steps=] is not null, then:

		1. Assert: |document|'s [=active view transition=]'s  [=ViewTransition/phase=] is "`pending-capture`".

		1. Let |viewTransitionParams| be null;

		1. Set |document|'s [=document/rendering suppression for view transitions=] to true.

			Issue: though [=capture the old state=] appears here as a synchronous step, it is in fact an asynchronous step
			as rendering an element into an image cannot be done synchronously. This should be more explicit in the L1 spec.

		1. [=Capture the old state=] for |transition|.

		1. Set |document|'s [=document/rendering suppression for view transitions=] to false.

		1. If this succeeded, then set |viewTransitionParams| to a new [=view transition params=] whose
			[=view transition params/named elements=] is a [=map/clone=] of |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/named elements=],
			and whose [=view transition params/initial snapshot containing block size=] is |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/initial snapshot containing block size=].

		1. [=Clear view transition=] |transition|.

			Note: The ViewTransition object on the old Document should be destroyed after its state has been copied to the new Document below.
				We explicitly clear it here since the old Document may be cached by the UA.

		1. Call |transition|'s [=outbound post-capture steps=] given |viewTransitionParams|.


## Monkey patches to HTML ## {#monkey-patch-to-html}

	<div algorithm="monkey patch to apply the history step">
		Prepend these steps at the beginning of the task [=queue a global task|queued=] on |navigable|'s [=active window=]
		when <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#apply-the-history-step">applying the history step</a> (14.11.1, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#updating-the-traversable:queue-a-global-task-3">here</a>):

		This monkey-patch step assumes a boolean |changingNavigationContinuation|, a [=/navigable=] |navigable|, a {{Document}} |oldDocument|, a {{Document}} |newDocument|, a {{NavigationType}} |navigationType|,
		and a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#user-navigation-involvement">user navigation involvement</a> |userInvolvementForNavigateEvents|.

		1. Let |isBrowserUINavigation| be true if |userInvolvementForNavigateEvents| is `"browser UI"`, otherwise false.

		1. If |changingNavigationContinuation| update-only is false, then [=setup cross-document view-transition=] given |oldDocument|, |newDocument|, |navigationType|, |isBrowserUINavigation|, and the remaining steps and return from these steps.

		Note: This would wait until a transition is captured or skipped before proceeding to unloading the old document and activating the new one.
	</div>


## Setting up and activating the cross-document view transition ## {#setting-up-and-activating-the-cross-document-view-transition}

### Resolving the ''@view-transition''' rule ### {#resolve-view-transition-rule-algo}

	<div algorithm>
		To get the <dfn>resolve @view-transition rule</dfn> for a {{Document}} |document|:

		1. If |document|'s [=Document/visibility state=] is "<code>hidden</code>",
			then return "<code>skip transition</code>".

		1. Let |matchingRule| be the last ''@view-transition'' rule in |document|.

		1. If |matchingRule| is not found, then return "<code>skip transition</code>".

		1. If |matchingRule|'s [=@view-transition/navigation=] descriptor's [=computed value=] is ''@view-transition/navigation/none'', then return "<code>skip transition</code>".

		1. Assert: |matchingRule|'s [=@view-transition/navigation=] descriptor's [=computed value=] is ''@view-transition/navigation/auto''.

		1. Let |typesDescriptor| be |matchingRule|'s [=@view-transition/type=] descriptor.

		1. If |typesDescriptor|'s [=computed value=] is ''@view-transition/type/none'', then return a [=/list=] « ».

		1. Return a [=list=] of strings corresponding to |typesDescriptor|'s [=computed value=].
	</div>

### Setting up the view-transition in the old {{Document}} ###  {#setup-old-document-vt}

	<div algorithm>
		To check if a <dfn export>navigation can trigger a cross-document view-transition?</dfn> given
		an [=/origin=] |oldOrigin|, an [=/origin=] |newOrigin|, a boolean |navigationHasCrossOriginRedirects|, a {{NavigationType}} |navigationType|, and a boolean |isBrowserUINavigation|:

			Note: this is called during navigation, potentially [=in parallel=], for documents that have opted-in to view-transitions using the ''@view-transition'' rule.

		1. If the user agent decides to display an [=implementation-defined=] navigation experience, e.g. a gesture-based transition for a back navigation,
			the user agent may ignore the author-defined view transition. If that is the case, return false.

		1. If |navigationType| is {{NavigationType/reload}}, then return false.

		1. If |isBrowserUINavigation| is true, and |navigationType| is {{NavigationType/push}} or {{NavigationType/replace}}, then return false.

		1. If |oldOrigin| is not [=same origin=] as |newOrigin| then return false.

		1. If |navigationHasCrossOriginRedirects| is true, then return false.

		1. Return true.
	</div>
	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn export>setup cross-document view-transition</dfn> given a {{Document}} |oldDocument|,
		a {{Document}} |newDocument|, and |proceedWithNavigation|, which is an algorithm accepting nothing:

		1. [=Assert=]: These steps are running as part of a [=task=] queued on |oldDocument|.

		1. If |oldDocument|'s [=has been revealed=] is false, then return null.

		1. Let |resolvedRule| be the result of [=Resolve @view-transition rule|resolving the @view-transition rule=] for |oldDocument|.

		1. If |resolvedRule| is "<code>skip transition</code>", then return null.

			Note: We don't know yet if |newDocument| has opted in, as it might not be parsed yet.
			We check the opt-in for |newDocument| when we fire the {{Window/pagereveal}} event.

		1. If |oldDocument|'s [=active view transition=] is not null,
			then [=skip the view transition|skip=] |oldDocument|'s [=active view transition=]
			with an "{{AbortError}}" {{DOMException}} in |oldDocument|'s [=relevant Realm=].

			Note: this means that any running transition would be skipped when the document is ready
			to unload.

		1. Let |outboundTransition| be a new {{ViewTransition}} object in |oldDocument|'s [=relevant Realm=],
			whose [=ViewTransition/active types=] is |resolvedRule|.

		1. Set |outboundTransition|'s [=outbound post-capture steps=] to the following steps given a [=view transition params=]-or-null |params|:
			1. Set |newDocument|'s [=inbound view transition params=] to |params|.

				Note: The inbound transition is activated after the dispatch of {{Window/pagereveal}} to ensure mutations made in this event apply to the captured new state.

			1. Call |proceedWithNavigation|.

		1. Set |oldDocument|'s [=active view transition=] to |outboundTransition|.

			Note: The process continues in [=perform pending transition operations=].

		1. The user agent should display the currently displayed frame until either:
			* The {{Window/pagereveal}} event is fired.
			* its [=active view transition=]'s [=ViewTransition/phase=] is "`done`".

			Note: this is to ensure that there are no unintended flashes between displaying the old and new state, to keep the transition smooth.

		1. Return |outboundTransition|.

### Accessing the view-transition in the new {{Document}} ### {#access-view-transition-in-new-doc}

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn export>resolve cross-document view-transition</dfn> for {{Document}} |document|:

		1. [=Assert=]: |document| is [=fully active=].

		1. Let |inboundViewTransitionParams| be |document|'s [=inbound view transition params=].

		1. If |inboundViewTransitionParams| is null, then return null.

		1. Set |document|'s [=inbound view transition params=] to null.

		1. If |document|'s [=active view transition=] is not null, then return null.

			Note: this means that starting a same-document transition before revealing the document would cancel a pending cross-document transition.

		1. [=Resolve @view-transition rule=] for |document| and let |resolvedRule| be the result.

		1. If |resolvedRule| is "<code>skip transition</code>", then return null.

		1. Let |transition| be a new {{ViewTransition}} in |document|'s [=relevant Realm=],
			whose [=ViewTransition/named elements=] is |inboundViewTransitionParams|'s [=view transition params/named elements=],
			and [=ViewTransition/initial snapshot containing block size=] is |inboundViewTransitionParams|'s [=view transition params/initial snapshot containing block size=].

		1. Set |document|'s [=active view transition=] to |transition|.

		1. [=Resolve=] |transition|’s [=ViewTransition/update callback done promise=] with undefined.

		1. Set |transition|’s [=ViewTransition/phase=] to "`update-callback-called`".

		1. Set |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/active types=] to |resolvedRule|.

		1. At any given time, the UA may decide to skip the inbound transition, e.g. after an [=implementation-defined=] timeout.
			To do so, the UA should [=queue a global task=] on the [=DOM manipulation task source=] given |document|'s [=relevant global object=] to perform the following step:
				If |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/phase=] is not "`done`", then [=skip the view transition=] |transition| with a "{{TimeoutError}}" {{DOMException}}.

		1. Return |transition|.

This specification introduces no new privacy considerations.

<h2 id="sec" class="no-num">Security Considerations</h2>

To prevent cross-origin issues, at this point cross-document view transitions can only be enabled for
same-origin navigations. As discussed in <a href="https://github.com/WICG/view-transitions/issues/200">WICG/view-transitions#200</a>,
this still presents two potential threats:

1. The [=environment settings object/cross-origin isolated capability=] in both documents might be different.
	This can cause a situation where a {{Document}} that is [=environment settings object/cross-origin isolated capability|cross-origin isolated=]
	can read image data from a document that is not cross-origin isolated. This is already mitigated in [[css-view-transitions-1#sec],
	as the same restriction applies for captured cross-origin iframes.

1. A same-origin navigation might still occur via a cross-origin redirect, e.g. <code>https://example.com</code>
	links to <code>https://auth-provider.com/</code> which redirects back to <code>https://example.com/loggedin</code>.

	This can cause a (minor) situation where the cross-origin party would redirect the user to an
	unexpected first-party URL, causing an unexpected transition and obfuscating that fact that there was a redirect.
	To mitigate this, currently view transitions are disabled for navigations if the {{Document}} [=was created via cross-origin redirects=].
	Note that this check doesn't apply when the {{Document}} is being [=Document/reactivated=], as in that case
	the cross-origin redirect has already taken place.

	Note: this only applies to server-side redirects. A client-side redirect, e.g. using
	[^meta/http-equiv/refresh^], is equivalent to a new navigation.

1. This feature exposes more information to CSS, as so far CSS was not aware of anything navigation-related.
	This can raise concerns around safety 3rd-party CSS. However, as a general rule, 3rd-party stylesheets should come
	from trusted sources to begin with, as CSS can learn about the document or change it in many ways.
