# Introduction # {#intro}

	*This section is non-normative.*

	View Transitions, as specified in [[css-view-transitions-1]], is a feature that allows developers
	to create animated transitions between visual states of the [=/document=].

	Level 2 extends that specification, by adding the necessary API and lifecycle to enable
	transitions across a same-origin cross-document navigation.


## Lifecycle ## {#lifecycle}

	*This section is non-normative.*

	A successful cross-document view transition goes through the following phases:

	1. The user navigates, by clicking a link, submitting a form, traversing history using the
		browser UI, etc.

	1. Once it's time to [=unload=] the old document, if the navigation is [=same origin=]
		and the old {{Document}} has opted in to cross-document view-transitions, the old state is captured.

	1. An event named {{Window/pagereveal}} is fired on the new {{Document}}, with a `viewTransition` property,
		which is a {{ViewTransition}} object. This {{ViewTransition}}'s <code>{{ViewTransition/updateCallbackDone}}</code> is already resolved,
		and its [=captured elements=] are populated from the old {{Document}}.

	1. Right before the new {{Document}} has the first [=rendering opportunity=], its state is captured as
		the "new" state.

	1. From this point forward, the transition continues as if it was a same-document transition, as per [=activate view transition=].

## Examples ## {#examples}

	<div class=example>
		To generate the same cross-fade as in the first example [[css-view-transitions-1#examples]],
		but across documents, we don't need JavaScript.

		Instead, we opt in to triggering view-transitions on navigation in both page 1 and page 2:

		```css
		// in both documents:
		@view-transition {
			navigation: auto;
		}
		```

		A link from page 1 to or from page 2 would generate a crossfade transition for example 1.
		To achieve the effect examples 2, 3 & 4, simply put the CSS for the pseudo-elements in both
		documents.
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		To achieve the effect in [[css-view-transitions-1#examples|example 5]], we have to do several
		things:

		- Opt-in to navigation-triggered view-transitions in both pages.
		- Pass the click location to the new document, e.g. via {{WindowSessionStorage/sessionStorage}}.
		- Intercept the {{ViewTransition}} object in the new document, using the {{Window/pagereveal}} event.

		In both pages:
		```css
		@view-transition {
			navigation: auto;
		}

		```

		In the old page:
		```js
		addEventListener('click', event => {
			sessionStorage.setItem("lastClickX", event.clientX);
			sessionStorage.setItem("lastClickY", event.clientY);
		});
		```

		In the new page:
		```js
		// This would run both on initial load and on reactivation from BFCache.
		addEventListener("pagereveal", async event => {
			if (!event.viewTransition)
				return;

			const x = sessionStorage.getItem("lastClickX") ?? innerWidth / 2;
			const y = sessionStorage.getItem("lastClickY") ?? innerHeight / 2;

			const endRadius = Math.hypot(
				Math.max(x, innerWidth - x),
				Math.max(y, innerHeight - y)
			);

			await event.viewTransition.ready;

			// Animate the new document's view
			document.documentElement.animate(
				{
					clipPath: [
						`circle(0 at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
						`circle(${endRadius}px at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
					],
				},
				{
					duration: 500,
					easing: 'ease-in',
					pseudoElement: '::view-transition-new(root)'
				}
			);
		})
		```
	</div>

# Pseudo-classes # {#pseudo-classes}

## Active View Transition Pseudo-class '':active-view-transition()''' ## {#the-active-view-transition-pseudo}

The <dfn id='active-view-transition-pseudo'>:active-view-transition(<<vt-type-selector>>)</dfn> pseudo-class applies to the root element of the document, if it has a matching [=active view transition=].
It has the following syntax definition:

<pre class=prod>
	:active-view-transition(<<vt-type-selector>>)
	<dfn>&lt;vt-type-selector></dfn> = '*' | <<custom-ident>>#
</pre>

The [=specificity=] of an '':active-view-transition()'' is one pseudo-class selector if it has value is ''*'', and two if it has any other value.

An ''::active-view-transition()'' pseudo-class matches the [=document element=] when it has an non-null [=active view transition=] |viewTransition|, for which any of the following are true:

* The <<vt-type-selector>> is ''*''
* |viewTransition|'s [=ViewTransition/active types=] [=list/contains=] at least one of the <<custom-ident>> values of the <<vt-type-selector>>.

<div class=example>
For example, the developer might start a transition in the following manner:
```js
document.startViewTransition({update: updateTheDOMSomehow, types: ["slide-in", "reverse"]});
```

This will activate any of the following '::active-view-transition()'' selectors:
```css
:root:active-view-transition(slide-in) {}
:root:active-view-transition(reverse) {}
:root:active-view-transition(slide-in, reverse) {}
:root:active-view-transition(slide-in, something-else) {}
:root:active-view-transition(*) {}
```

While starting a transition without selecting transition types, would only activate '::active-view-transition()'' with ''*'':

```js
document.startViewTransition(updateTheDOMSomehow);
// or
document.startViewTransition({update: updateTheDOMSomehow});
```

```css
/* This would be active */
:root { }
:root:active-view-transition(*) {}

/* This would not be active */
:root:active-view-transition(slide-in) {}
:root:active-view-transition(any-type-at-all-except-star) {}
```
</div>

# CSS rules # {#css-rules}

## The <dfn id="at-view-transition-rule">''@view-transition''</dfn> rule ## {#view-transition-rule}

The ''@view-transition'' rule is used by a document to indicate that cross-document navigations
should setup and activate a {{ViewTransition}}. To take effect, it must be present in the old document
when unloading, and in the new document when the {{Window/pagereveal}} is fired.


## @view-transition rule grammar ## {#view-transition-grammar}

The ''@view-transition'' rule has the following syntax:

<pre class=prod>
	@view-transition {
		<<declaration-rule-list>>
	}
</pre>

Note: as per default behavior, the ''@view-transition'' rule can be nested inside a
[=conditional group rule=] such as ''@media'' or ''@supports''.

## The [=@view-transition/navigation=] descriptor ## {#view-transition-navigation-descriptor}

	<pre class='descdef'>
	Name: navigation
	For: @view-transition
	Value: auto | none
	Initial: none
	</pre>

	The '<dfn for="@view-transition">navigation</dfn>' descriptor opts in to automatically starting a view transition when performing a navigation of a certain type.
	It needs to be enabled both in the old document (when unloading) and in the new document (when reveal).

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="@view-transition/navigation">
		: <dfn>none</dfn>
		:: There will be no transition.

		: <dfn>auto</dfn>
		:: The transition will be enabled if the navigation is same-origin, without cross-origin
			redirects, and whoes {{NavigationType}} is
			* {{NavigationType/traverse}} or
			* {{NavigationType/push}} or {{NavigationType/replace}} with <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#user-navigation-involvement">user navigation involvement</a> not equal to `"browser UI"`.

			Note: Navigations excluded from ''@view-transition/navigation/auto'' are for example, navigating
			via the URL address bar or clicking a bookmark, as well as any form of user or script initiated {{NavigationType/reload}}.

	</dl>

## The [=@view-transition/type=] descriptor ## {#view-transition-type-descriptor}

	<pre class='descdef'>
	Name: type
	For: @view-transition
	Value: none | <<custom-ident>>*
	Initial: none
	</pre>

	The '<dfn for="@view-transition">type</dfn>' descriptor sets the [=ViewTransition/active types=] for the transition
	when capturing and performing the transition, equivalent to calling {{Document/startViewTransition(callbackOptions)}} with that {{StartViewTransitionOptions/type}}.

# API # {#api}

## Additions to {{Document}} ## {#additions-to-document-api}

	<xmp class=idl>
		dictionary StartViewTransitionOptions {
			UpdateCallback? update = null;
			sequence<DOMString>? type = null;
		};

		partial interface Document {

			ViewTransition startViewTransition(optional (UpdateCallback or StartViewTransitionOptions) callbackOptions = {});
		};
	</xmp>

### {{Document/startViewTransition(callbackOptions)}} Method Steps ### {#ViewTransition-start-with-options}

	<div algorithm="start-vt-with-options">
		The [=method steps=] for <dfn method for=Document>startViewTransition(|callbackOptions|)</dfn> are as follows:

		1. If |callbackOptions| is not provided, then run the [=method steps=] for {{Document/startViewTransition()}} and return the result.

		1. If |callbackOptions| is an {{UpdateCallback}}, then run the [=method steps=] for {{Document/startViewTransition(updateCallback)}} given |callbackOptions| and return the result.

		1. Let |viewTransition| be the result of running [=method steps=] for {{Document/startViewTransition(updateCallback)}} given |callbackOptions|'s {{StartViewTransitionOptions/update}}.

		1. Set |viewTransition|'s [=ViewTransition/active types=] to |callbackOptions|'s {{StartViewTransitionOptions/type}}.

		1. Return |viewTransition|.
	</div>

## Extensions to the <code>CSSRule</code> interface</h3> ## {#extensions-to-cssrule-interface}

The <code>CSSRule</code> interface is extended as follows:

<pre class='idl'>
partial interface CSSRule {
	const unsigned short VIEW_TRANSITION_RULE = 15;
};
</pre>

## The <code>CSSViewTransitionRule</code> interface</h3> ## {#navgation-behavior-rule-interface}

The {{CSSViewTransitionRule}} represents a ''@view-transition'' rule.

<xmp class=idl>
		enum ViewTransitionNavigation { "auto", "none" };
		[Exposed=Window]
		interface CSSViewTransitionRule : CSSRule {
			attribute ViewTransitionNavigation navigation;
			attribute DOMTokenList type;
		};
</xmp>


# Algorithms # {#algorithms}
## Data Structures ## {#concepts}

### Additions to {{ViewTransition}} ### {#view-transitions-extension}

	A {{ViewTransition}} additionally has:
	<dl dfn-for=ViewTransition>
		: <dfn>is inbound cross-document transition</dfn>
		:: a boolean, initially false.

		Issue: should a cross-document transition take precedent? See [#9512](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9512)

		: <dfn>active types</dfn>
		:: Null or a [=list=] of strings, initially null.
	</dl>

## Monkey patches to HTML ## {#monkey-patch-to-html}

	<div algorithm="monkey patch to apply the history step">
		Prepend these steps at the beginning of the task [=queue a global task|queued=] on |navigable|'s [=active window=]
		when <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#apply-the-history-step">applying the history step</a> (14.11.1, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#updating-the-traversable:queue-a-global-task-3">here</a>):

		This monkey-patch step assumes a boolean |changingNavigationContinuation|, a [=/navigable=] |navigable|, a {{Document}} |oldDocument|, a {{Document}} |newDocument|, a {{NavigationType}} |navigationType|,
		and a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#user-navigation-involvement">user navigation involvement</a> |userInvolvementForNavigateEvents|.

		1. Let |isBrowserUINavigation| be true if |userInvolvementForNavigateEvents| is `"browser UI"`, otherwise false.

		1. If |changingNavigationContinuation| update-only is false, then [=setup cross-document view-transition=] given |oldDocument|, |newDocument|, |navigationType|, |isBrowserUINavigation|, and the remaining steps and return from these steps.

		Note: This would wait until a transition is captured or skipped before proceeding to unloading the old document and activating the new one.
	</div>


## Setting up and activating the cross-document view transition ## {#setting-up-and-activating-the-cross-document-view-transition}

### Resolving the ''@view-transition''' rule ### {#resolve-view-transition-rule-algo}

	<div algorithm>
		To get the <dfn>resolve @view-transition rule</dfn> for a {{Document}} |document|:

		1. Let |matchingRule| be the last ''@view-transition'' rule in |document|.

		1. If |matchingRule| is not found, then return "<code>skip transition</code>".

		1. If |matchingRule|'s [=@view-transition/navigation=] descriptor's [=computed value=] is ''@view-transition/navigation/none'', then return "<code>skip transition</code>".

		1. Assert: |matchingRule|'s [=@view-transition/navigation=] descriptor's [=computed value=] is ''@view-transition/navigation/auto''.

		1. Let |typesDescriptor| be |matchingRule|'s [=@view-transition/type=] descriptor.

		1. If |typesDescriptor|'s [=computed value=] is ''@view-transition/type/none'', then return a [=/list=] « ».

		1. Return a [=list=] of strings corresponding to |typesDescriptor|'s [=computed value=].
	</div>

### Setting up the view-transition in the old {{Document}} ###  {#setup-old-document-vt}

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn export>setup cross-document view-transition</dfn> given a {{Document}} |oldDocument|,
		a {{Document}} |newDocument|, a {{NavigationType}} |navigationType|, a boolean |isBrowserUINavigation|, and |onReady|, which is an algorithm accepting nothing:

		1. If the user agent decides to display an [=implementation-defined=] navigation experience, e.g. a gesture-based transition for a back navigation,
			the user agent may ignore the author-defined view transition. If that is the case, return.

		1. If |navigationType| is {{NavigationType/reload}}, then return.

		1. If |isBrowserUINavigation| is true, and |navigationType| is {{NavigationType/push}} or {{NavigationType/replace}}, then return.

		1. If |oldDocument|'s [=environment settings object/origin=] is not [=same origin=] as
			|newDocument|'s [=environment settings object/origin=] then call |onReady| and return.

		1. If |newDocument| [=was created via cross-origin redirects=] is true
			and |newDocument|'s [=latest entry=] is null, then call |onReady| and return.

			Note: A document with a non-null [=latest entry=]
			is being [=Document/reactivated=], in which case we don't need to check for cross-origin redirects.

		1. [=Resolve @view-transition rule=] for |oldDocument| and let |resolvedRule| be the result.

		1. If |resolvedRule| is "<code>skip transition</code>", then call |onReady| and return.

			Note: We don't know yet if |newDocument| has opted in, as it might not be parsed yet.
			We check the opt-in for |newDocument| when we fire the {{Window/pagereveal}} event.

		1. If |oldDocument|'s [=active view transition=] is not null,
			then [=skip the view transition|skip=] |oldDocument|'s [=active view transition=]
			with an "{{AbortError}}" {{DOMException}} in |oldDocument|'s [=relevant Realm=].

			Note: this means that any running transition would be skipped when the document is ready
			to unload.

		1. Set |document|'s [=auto-skip view transitions=] to true.

			Note: this means that calling {{Document/startViewTransition()}} while capturing the old document for a cross-document view-transition would run the callback but skip the animation.

		1. Let |outboundTransition| be a new {{ViewTransition}} object in |oldDocument|'s [=relevant Realm=],
			whose [=ViewTransition/active types=] is |resolvedRule|, and whose [=ViewTransition/process old state captured=] is set to the following steps:

			Issue: should we check for the opt-in again, in case there was a CSSOM change in a requestAnimationFrame callback?

			1. If |outboundTransition|'s [=ViewTransition/phase=] is "`done`", then call |onReady| and return.

			1. Assert: |outboundTransition|'s  [=ViewTransition/phase=] is "`pending-capture`".

			1. [=Clear view transition=] |outboundTransition|.

				Note: The ViewTransition object on the old Document should be destroyed after its state has been copied to the new Document below.
					We explicitly clear it here since the old Document may be cached by the UA.

			1. Set |document|'s [=auto-skip view transitions=] to false.

			1. [=Queue a global task=] on the [=DOM manipulation task source=] given |newDocument|'s [=relevant global object=],
				to perform the following steps:

				1. Let |inboundTransition| be a new {{ViewTransition}} in |newDocument|'s [=relevant Realm=],
					whose [=ViewTransition/named elements=] is |outboundTransition|'s [=ViewTransition/named elements=],
					[=ViewTransition/initial snapshot containing block size=] is |outboundTransition|'s [=ViewTransition/initial snapshot containing block size=],
					and whose [=ViewTransition/is inbound cross-document transition=] is true.

				1. Set |newDocument|'s [=active view transition=] to |inboundTransition|.

				1. [=Resolve=] |inboundTransition|’s [=ViewTransition/update callback done promise=] with undefined.

				1. Set |inboundTransition|’s [=ViewTransition/phase=] to "`update-callback-called`".

				1. Call |onReady|.
					
					Note: The |inboundTransition| is activated after the dispatch of {{Window/pagereveal}} to ensure mutations made in this event apply to the captured new state.

				1. At any given time, the UA may decide to skip |inboundTransition|, e.g. after an [=implementation-defined=] timeout.
					To do so, the UA should [=queue a global task=] on the [=DOM manipulation task source=] given |document|'s [=relevant global object=] to perform the following step:
						If |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/phase=] is not "`done`", then [=skip the view transition=] |transition| with a "{{TimeoutError}}" {{DOMException}}.

			Note: |outboundTransition| is not exposed to JavaScript, it is used only for capturing
			the state of the old document.

		1. Set |oldDocument|'s [=active view transition=] to |outboundTransition|.

			Note: The process continues in [=setup view transition=], via [=perform pending transition operations=].

		1. The user agent should display the currently displayed frame until either:
			* The {{Window/pagereveal}} event is fired.
			* its [=active view transition=]'s [=ViewTransition/phase=] is "`done`".

			Note: this is to ensure that there are no unintended flashes between displaying the old and new state, to keep the transition smooth.
	</div>

### Accessing the view-transition in the new {{Document}} ### {#access-view-transition-in-new-doc}

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn export>resolve cross-document view-transition</dfn> for {{Document}} |document|:

		1. Let |transition| be |document|'s [=active view transition=].

		1. If |transition| is null or |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/is inbound cross-document transition=] is false,
			then return null.

			Note: |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/is inbound cross-document transition=] would be false if a same-document
			transition was started before the {{Window/pagereveal}} event was fired.

		1. [=Resolve @view-transition rule=] for |document| and let |resolvedRule| be the result.

		1. If |resolvedRule| is "<code>skip transition</code>", then [=skip the view transition|skip=] |transition| and return null.

		1. Set |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/active types=] to |resolvedRule|.

		1. Return |transition|.
	</div>


<h2 id="priv" class="no-num">Privacy Considerations</h2>

This specification introduces no new privacy considerations.

<h2 id="sec" class="no-num">Security Considerations</h2>

To prevent cross-origin issues, at this point cross-document view transitions can only be enabled for
same-origin navigations. As discussed in <a href="https://github.com/WICG/view-transitions/issues/200">WICG/view-transitions#200</a>,
this still presents two potential threats:

1. The [=environment settings object/cross-origin isolated capability=] in both documents might be different.
	This can cause a situation where a {{Document}} that is [=environment settings object/cross-origin isolated capability|cross-origin isolated=]
	can read image data from a document that is not cross-origin isolated. This is already mitigated in [[css-view-transitions-1#sec],
	as the same restriction applies for captured cross-origin iframes.

1. A same-origin navigation might still occur via a cross-origin redirect, e.g. <code>https://example.com</code>
	links to <code>https://auth-provider.com/</code> which redirects back to <code>https://example.com/loggedin</code>.

	This can cause a (minor) situation where the cross-origin party would redirect the user to an
	unexpected first-party URL, causing an unexpected transition and obfuscating that fact that there was a redirect.
	To mitigate this, currently view transitions are disabled for navigations if the {{Document}} [=was created via cross-origin redirects=].
	Note that this check doesn't apply when the {{Document}} is being [=Document/reactivated=], as in that case
	the cross-origin redirect has already taken place.

	Note: this only applies to server-side redirects. A client-side redirect, e.g. using
	[^meta/http-equiv/refresh^], is equivalent to a new navigation.

1. This feature exposes more information to CSS, as so far CSS was not aware of anything navigation-related.
	This can raise concerns around safety 3rd-party CSS. However, as a general rule, 3rd-party stylesheets should come
	from trusted sources to begin with, as CSS can learn about the document or change it in many ways.
