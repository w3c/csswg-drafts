# Introduction # {#intro}

	*This section is non-normative.*

	View Transitions, as specified in [[css-view-transitions-1]], is a feature that allows developers
	to create animated transitions between visual states of the [=/document=].

	Level 2 extends that specification, by adding the necessary API and lifecycle to enable
	transitions across a same-origin cross-document navigation.


## Lifecycle ## {#lifecycle}

	*This section is non-normative.*

	A successful cross-document view transition goes through the following phases:

	1. The user navigates, by clicking a link, submitting a form, traversing history using the
		browser UI, etc.

	1. Once it's time to [=unload=] the old document, if the navigation is [=same origin=]
		and the old {{Document}} has opted in to cross-document view-transitions, the old state is captured.

	1. An event named {{PageRevealEvent|reveal}} is fired on the new {{Document}}, with a `viewTransition` property,
		which is a {{ViewTransition}} object. This {{ViewTransition}}'s <code>{{ViewTransition/updateCallbackDone}}</code> is already resolved,
		and its [=captured elements=] are populated from the old {{Document}}.

	1. Right before the new {{Document}} has the first [=rendering opportunity=], its state is captured as
		the "new" state.

	1. From this point forward, the transition continues as if it was a same-document transition, as per [=activate view transition=].

## Examples ## {#examples}

	<div class=example>
		To generate the same cross-fade as in the first example [[css-view-transitions-1#examples]],
		but across documents, we don't need JavaScript.

		Instead, we opt in to auto-view-transitions in both page 1 and page 2:

		```css
		// in both documents:
		@auto-view-transitions {
			same-origin: enable;
		}
		```

		A link from page 1 to or from page 2 would generate a crossfade transition for example 1.
		To achieve the effect examples 2, 3 & 4, simply put the CSS for the pseudo-elements in both
		documents.
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		To achieve the effect in [[css-view-transitions-1#examples|example 5]], we have to do several
		things:

		- Opt-in to auto-view-transitions in both pages.
		- Pass the click location to the new document, e.g. via {{WindowSessionStorage/sessionStorage}}.
		- Intercept the {{ViewTransition}} object in the new document, using the {{PageRevealEvent|reveal event}}.

		In both pages:
		```css
		@auto-view-transitions {
			same-origin: enable;
		}

		```

		In the old page:
		```js
		addEventListener('click', event => {
			sessionStorage.setItem("lastClickX", event.clientX);
			sessionStorage.setItem("lastClickY", event.clientY);
		});
		```

		In the new page:
		```js
		// This would run both on initial load and on reactivation from BFCache.
		addEventListener("reveal", async event => {
			if (!event.viewTransition)
				return;

			const x = sessionStorage.getItem("lastClickX") ?? innerWidth / 2;
			const y = sessionStorage.getItem("lastClickY") ?? innerHeight / 2;

			const endRadius = Math.hypot(
				Math.max(x, innerWidth - x),
				Math.max(y, innerHeight - y)
			);

			await event.viewTransition.ready;

			// Animate the new document's view
			document.documentElement.animate(
				{
					clipPath: [
						`circle(0 at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
						`circle(${endRadius}px at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
					],
				},
				{
					duration: 500,
					easing: 'ease-in',
					pseudoElement: '::view-transition-new(root)'
				}
			);
		})
		```
	</div>



# CSS rules # {#css-rules}

## The <dfn id="at-auto-view-transition-rule">''@auto-view-transition''</dfn> rule ## {#auto-view-transition-rule}

The ''@auto-view-transition'' rule is used by a document to indicate that cross-document navigations
should setup and activate a {{ViewTransition}}. To take effect, it must be present in the old document
when unloading, and in the new document when it is being [=reveal document|revealed=].


## @auto-view-transition rule grammar ## {#auto-view-transition-grammer}

''@auto-view-transition'' rules are [=CSS/parsed=] according to the following grammar,
plus the additional rules noted below:

<pre class=prod>
	@auto-view-transition = @auto-view-transition { <<declaration-rule-list>> }
</pre>

## The [=@auto-view-transition/same-origin=] property ## {#view-transition-name-prop}

	<pre class='descdef'>
	Name: same-origin
	For: @auto-view-transition
	Value: enabled | disabled
	Initial: disabled
	</pre>

	The '<dfn for="@auto-view-transition">same-origin</dfn>' property opts in to automatically performing a view transition when performing a [=same origin=] navigation.
	It needs to be enabled both in the old document (when unloading) and in the new document (when ready to render).

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="same-origin">
		: <dfn>disabled</dfn>
		:: There will be no transition.

		: <dfn>enabled</dfn>
		:: The transition will be enabled if the navigation is same-origin, without cross-origin
			redirects.
	</dl>

# API # {#api}

## The <dfn interface>PageRevealEvent</dfn> ## {#reveal-event}

Note: this should go in the HTML spec. See [Issue 9315](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9315).

<xmp class=idl>
		[Exposed=Window]
		interface PageRevealEvent : Event {
			readonly attribute ViewTransition? viewTransition;
		};
</xmp>

Note: this event is fired when [=reveal document|revealing a document=].

The <dfn attribute for=PageRevealEvent>viewTransition</dfn> [=getter steps=] are to return the
[=inbound cross-document view-transition=] for [=this's=] [=relevant global object's=] [=associated document=].



# Algorithms # {#algorithms}
## Data Structures ## {#concepts}

### Additions to {{Document}} ### {#additions-to-document}

	A {{Document}} additionally has:

	<dl dfn-for=document>
		: <dfn>is revealed</dfn>
		:: a boolean, initially false.

### Additions to {{ViewTransition}} ## {#view-transitions-extension}

	A {{ViewTransition}} additionally has:
	<dl dfn-for=ViewTransition>
		: <dfn>is inbound cross-document transition</dfn>
		:: a boolean, initially false.
	</dl>

## Monkey patches to HTML ## {#monkey-patch-to-html}

	<div algorithm="monkey patch to apply the history step">
		Prepend a step at the beginning of the task [=queue a global task|queued=] on |navigable|'s [=active window=]
		when <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#apply-the-history-step">applying the history step</a> (14.11.1, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#updating-the-traversable:queue-a-global-task-3">here</a>):

		If |changingNavigationContinuation| update-only is false, then [=setup outbound cross-document view transition=] given |oldDocument|, |newDocument| and the remaining steps and return from these steps.

		Note: This would wait until a transition is captured or skipped before proceeding to unloading the old document and activating the new one.
	</div>

	<div algorithm="monkey patch to rendering">
		Run the following step in [=update the rendering|updating the renedering=], before [=running the animation frame callbacks=]:

		1. For each [=fully active=] {{Document}} |doc| in |docs|, [=reveal document|reveal=] |doc|.
	</div>

	<div algorithm="monkey patch to reactivation">
		Run the following step at the end of [=Document/reactivate=]:

		1. Set |document|'s [=is revealed=] to false.
	</div>

	<div algorithm="page reveal">
	To <dfn>reveal {{Document}}</dfn> |document|:
		1. If |document|'s [=document/is revealed=] is true, then return.

		1. Let |transition| be the result of getting the [=inbound cross-document view-transition=] for |document|.

		1. If |transition| is not null and |document| does not [=opt in to cross-document view transitions=], then [=skip the view transition|skip=] |transition| and set |transition| to null.

		1. [=Fire an event=] named <dfn event for="Window">reveal</dfn> on |document|'s [=relevant global object=],
			using {{PageRevealEvent}}.

		1. If |transition| is not null, then [=activate view transition|activate=] |transition|.

		1. Set |document|'s [=document/is revealed=] to true.
	</div>

## Setting up and activating the cross-document view transition ## {#setting-up-and-activating-the-cross-document-view-transition}

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn>setup outbound cross-document view transition</dfn> given a {{Document}} |oldDocument|,
		a {{Document}} |newDocument|, and |onReady|, which is an algorithm accepting nothing:

		1. If |oldDocument|'s [=environment settings object/origin=] is not [=same origin=] as
			|newDocument|'s [=environment settings object/origin=] then call |onReady| and return.

		1. If |newDocument| [=was created via cross-origin redirects=] is true
			and |newDocument|'s [=latest entry=] is null, then call |onReady| and return.

			Note: A document with a non-null [=latest entry=]
			is being [=Document/reactivated=], in which case we don't need to check for cross-origin redirects.

		1. If |oldDocument| does not [=opt in to cross-document view transitions=], then call |onReady| and return.

			Note: We don't know yet if |newDocument| has opted in, as it might not be parsed yet.
			We check the opt-in for |newDocument| when it is [=reveal document|revealed=].

		1. If |oldDocument|'s [=active view transition=] is not null,
			then [=skip the view transition|skip=] |oldDocument|'s [=active view transition=]
			with an "{{AbortError}}" {{DOMException}} in |oldDocument|'s [=relevant Realm=].

			Note: this means that any running transition would be skipped when the document is ready
			to unload.

		1. Let |outboundTransition| be a new {{ViewTransition}} object in |oldDocument|'s [=relevant Realm=],
			whose [=ViewTransition/process old state captured=] is set to the following steps:

			Issue: should we check for the opt-in again, in case there was a CSSOM change in a requestAnimationFrame callback?

			1. If |outboundTransition|'s [=ViewTransition/phase=] is "`done`", then call |onReady| and return.

			1. Assert: |outboundTransition|'s  [=ViewTransition/phase=] is "`pending-capture`".

			1. [=Clear view transition=] |outboundTransition|.

				Note: The ViewTransition object on the old Document should be destroyed after its state has been copied to the new Document below.
					We explicitly clear it here since the old Document may be cached by the UA.

			1. [=Queue a global task=] on the [=DOM manipulation task source=] given |newDocument|'s [=relevant global object=],
				to perform the following step:

				1. Let |newDocument|'s [=active view transition=] be a new {{ViewTransition}} in |newDocument|'s [=relevant Realm=],
					whose [=ViewTransition/named elements=] is |outboundTransition|'s [=ViewTransition/named elements=],
					[=ViewTransition/initial snapshot containing block size=] is |outboundTransition|'s [=ViewTransition/initial snapshot containing block size=],
					and whose [=ViewTransition/is inbound cross-document transition=] is true.

				1. [=Call the update callback=] for |newDocument|'s [=active view transition=].

				1. Call |onReady|.

			Note: |outboundTransition| is not exposed to JavaScript, it is used only for capturing
			the state of the old document.

		1. Set |oldDocument|'s [=active view transition=] to |outboundTransition|.

			Note: The process continues in [=setup view transition=], via [=perform pending transition operations=], which is called in [[css-view-transitions-1#monkey-patch-to-rendering-algorithm]].
	</div>

	<div algorithm>
		To get the <dfn>inbound cross-document view-transition</dfn> for a {{Document}} |document|:

		1. Let |transition| be |document|'s [=active view transition=].

		1. If |transition| is null or |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/is inbound cross-document transition=] is false,
			then return null.

			Note: |transition|'s [=ViewTransition/is inbound cross-document transition=] would be false if a same-document
			transition was started before the page was revealed.

		1. Return |transition|.
	</div>

	<div algorithm>
		A {{Document}} |document| is said to <dfn>opt in to cross-document view transitions</dfn>
		if the [=computed value=] of <a data-xref-type="css-descriptor" data-xref-for="@auto-view-transition">same-origin</a>
		is <code>enabled</code>.
	</div>


<h2 id="priv" class="no-num">Privacy Considerations</h2>

This specification introduces no new privacy considerations.

<h2 id="sec" class="no-num">Security Considerations</h2>

To prevent cross-origin issues, at this point cross-document view transitions can only be enabled for
same-origin navigations. As discussed in <a href="https://github.com/WICG/view-transitions/issues/200">WICG/view-transitions#200</a>,
this still presents two potential threats:

1. The [=environment settings object/cross-origin isolated capability=] in both documents might be different.
	This can cause a situation where a {{Document}} that is [=environment settings object/cross-origin isolated capability|cross-origin isolated=]
	can read image data from a document that is not cross-origin isolated. This is already mitigated in [[css-view-transitions-1#sec],
	as the same restriction applies for captured cross-origin iframes.

1. A same-origin navigation might still occur via a cross-origin redirect, e.g. <code>https://example.com</code>
	links to <code>https://auth-provider.com/</code> which redirects back to <code>https://example.com/loggedin</code>.

	This can cause a (minor) situation where the cross-origin party would redirect the user to an
	unexpected first-party URL, causing an unexpected transition and obfuscating that fact that there was a redirect.
	To mitigate this, currently view transitions are disabled for navigations if the {{Document}} [=was created via cross-origin redirects=].
	Note that this check doesn't apply when the {{Document}} is being [=Document/reactivated=], as in that case
	the cross-origin redirect has already taken place.

	Note: this only applies to server-side redirects. A client-side redirect, e.g. using
	[^meta/http-equiv/refresh^], is equivalent to a new navigation.

1. This feature exposes more information to CSS, as so far CSS was not aware of anything navigation-related.
	This can raise concerns around safety 3rd-party CSS. However, as a general rule, 3rd-party stylesheets should come
	from trusted sources to begin with, as CSS can learn about the document or change it in many ways.
