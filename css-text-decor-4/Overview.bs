<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	<em>This subsection is non-normative.</em>

	This module covers text decoration, i.e. decorating the glyphs
	of the text once typeset according to font and typographic rules.
	(See [[CSS-TEXT-3]] and [[CSS-FONTS-3]].)
	Such features are traditionally used not only for purely decorative purposes,
	but also in some cases to show emphasis, for honorifics,
	and to indicate editorial changes such as insertions, deletions, and misspellings.

	CSS Levels 1 and 2 only defined very basic <a href="#line-decoration">line decorations</a>
	(underlines, overlines, and strike-throughs)
	appropriate to Western typographical traditions.
	Level 3 of this module added the ability to change
	the color, style, position, and continuity of these decorations,
	and also introduced
	<a href="#emphasis-marks">emphasis marks</a> (traditionally used in East Asian typography),
	and <a href="#text-shadow-property">shadows</a> (which were proposed then deferred from Level 2).
	Level 4 introduces additional controls over these decorations.

<h3 id="placement">
Module Interactions</h3>

	This module replaces and extends the text-decorating
	features defined in [[CSS-TEXT-DECOR-3]].

	All of the properties in this module
	can be applied to the ''::first-line'' and ''::first-letter'' [=pseudo-elements=].

<h3 id="values">
Value Definitions</h3>

	This specification follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]]
	using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs">value definition syntax</a> from [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values &amp; Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification
	also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> as their property value.
	For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

<h3 id="terms">Terminology</h3>

	The terms [=typographic character unit=] (<dfn>character</dfn>),
	[=typographic letter unit=] ([=letter=]),
	and [=content language=]
	as used in this specification are defined in [[!CSS-TEXT-3]].
	Other terminology and concepts used in this specification are defined
	in [[!CSS2]] and [[!CSS-WRITING-MODES-4]].


<h2 id="line-decoration">
Line Decoration: Underline, Overline, and Strike-Through</h2>


	The following properties describe line decorations that are added to the content of an element.
	When specified on or propagated to an <a>inline box</a>,
	that <a>box</a> becomes a <dfn>decorating box</dfn> for that decoration,
	applying the decoration to all its <a>fragments</a>.
	The decoration is then further propagated to any <a>in-flow</a> <a>block-level</a> boxes that split the inline
	(see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#anonymous-block-level">CSS2.1 section 9.2.1.1</a>).
	When specified on or propagated to a <a>block container</a> that establishes an <a>inline formatting context</a>,
	the decorations are propagated to an <a>anonymous</a> inline box that wraps all the <a>in-flow</a> <a>inline-level</a> children of the <a>block container</a>.
	When specified on or propagated to a <a>ruby container</a>,
	the decorations are propagated only to the <a>ruby base</a>.
	For all other box types,
	the decorations are propagated to all [=in-flow=] children.

	<p class="note">
		Note that text decorations are not propagated to any out-of-flow descendants,
		nor to the contents of atomic inline-level descendants such as inline blocks and inline tables.
		They are also not propagated to inline children of inline boxes,
		although the decoration is <em>applied</em> to such boxes.


	Underlines, overlines, and line-throughs are drawn only for <a>non-replaced</a> <a>inline boxes</a>,
	and are drawn across all text (including white space, letter spacing, and word spacing)
	except spacing (white space, letter spacing, and word spacing) at the beginning and end of a line.
	<a>Atomic inlines</a>, such as images and inline blocks, are not decorated.
	Margins, borders, and padding of the [=decorating box=] are always skipped,
	however the margins, border, and padding of descendant <a>inline boxes</a> are not.

	<p class='note'>
		Note that CSS 2.1 required skipping margins, borders, and padding always.
		In Level 3 and beyond, by default
		only the margins, borders, and padding of the [=decorating box=]
		are skipped.
		In the future CSS2.1 may be updated to match this new default.

	[=Relatively positioning=] a descendant moves all text decorations
	applied to it along with the descendant's text; it does not affect
	calculation of the decoration's initial position on that line.
	The 'visibility' property, 'text-shadow', filters, and other graphical transformations
	likewise affect text decorations as part of the text they're drawn on,
	even if the decorations were specified on an ancestor box,
	and do not affect the calculation of their initial positions or thicknesses.
	(In the case of line decorations drawn over an [=atomic inline=]
	or across the margins/borders/padding of a [=non-replaced=] [=inline box=],
	they are analogously associated with the affected atomic inline / non-replaced inline box
	rather than with the [=decorating box=].)

	<div class="example">
		In the following style sheet and document fragment:
		<pre>
		  blockquote { text-decoration: underline; color: blue; }
		  em { display: block; }
		  cite { color: fuchsia; }
		</pre>
		<pre>
		  &lt;blockquote&gt;
		   &lt;p&gt;
		    &lt;span&gt;
		     Help, help!
		     &lt;em&gt; I am under a hat! &lt;/em&gt;

		     &lt;cite&gt; &mdash;GwieF &lt;/cite&gt;
		    &lt;/span&gt;
		   &lt;/p&gt;
		  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
		</pre>
		...the underlining for the blockquote element is propagated to an
		anonymous inline box that surrounds the span element, causing
		the text "Help, help!" to be blue, with the blue underlining from
		the anonymous inline underneath it, the color being taken from the
		blockquote element. The <code>&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;</code>
		in the em block is also underlined, as it is in an in-flow block to
		which the underline is propagated. The final line of text is fuchsia,
		but the underline underneath it is still the blue underline from the
		anonymous inline element.
		<img src="images/underline-example.png" alt="Sample rendering of the above underline example">
		This diagram shows the boxes involved in the example above. The
		rounded aqua line represents the anonymous inline element wrapping
		the inline contents of the paragraph element, the rounded blue line
		represents the span element, and the orange lines represent the
		blocks.
	</div>

	Note: Line decorations are propagated through the box tree,
	not through inheritance,
	and thus have no effect on descendants
	when specified on an element with ''display: contents''.


<h3 id="text-decoration-line-property">
Text Decoration Lines: the 'text-decoration-line' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-decoration-line
	Value: none | [ underline || overline || line-through || blink ] | spelling-error | grammar-error
	Initial: none
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no (but see prose, above)
	Computed value: specified keyword(s)
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	This property,
	which is a <a>sub-property</a> of the 'text-decoration' shorthand,
	specifies what line decorations, if any, are added by the element.
	Values other than ''text-decoration-line''
	cause the element to originate the indicated text decorations,
	and to apply and propagate it as described [[#line-decoration|above]].

	Note: Unless it is desired for the color, style, and thickness of the lines
	to be set by declarations lower in the [=cascade=],
	it is safer to use the 'text-decoration' [=shorthand=]
	instead of this [=longhand=].

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=text-decoration-line>
		<dt><dfn>none</dfn>
		<dd>
			Neither produces nor inhibits text decoration.

		<dt><dfn>underline</dfn>
		<dd>
			Each line of text is underlined.

		<dt><dfn>overline</dfn>
		<dd>
			Each line of text has a line over it
			(i.e. on the opposite side from an underline).

		<dt><dfn>line-through</dfn>
		<dd>
			Each line of text has a line through the middle.

		<dt><dfn>blink</dfn>
		<dd>
			The text blinks (alternates between visible and invisible).
			Conforming user agents may simply not blink the text.
			Note that not blinking the text is one technique to satisfy
			<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG/guidelines.html#tech-on-off-blinking-text">checkpoint 3.3 of WAI-UAAG</a>.
			This value is <strong>deprecated</strong>
			in favor of Animations [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]].

		<dt><dfn>spelling-error</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value indicates the type of text decoration
			used by the user agent to highlight spelling mistakes.
			Its appearance is UA-defined,
			and may be platform-dependent.
			<span class=note>It is often rendered as a red wavy underline.</span>

		<dt><dfn>grammar-error</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value indicates the type of text decoration
			used by the user agent to highlight grammar mistakes.
			Its appearance is UA defined,
			and may be platform-dependent.
			<span class=note>It is often rendered as a green wavy underline.</span>
	</dl>

	Note: In <a>vertical writing modes</a>,
	'text-underline-position' can cause the underline and overline to switch sides.
	This allows the position of underlines to key off of language-specific preferences
	automatically.

	Since ''spelling-error'' and ''grammar-error'' decorations are entirely UA-defined,
	the UA <em>may</em> disregard
	the other <a>sub-properties</a> of 'text-decoration',
	as well any other properties typically affecting the appearance of line decorations
	(such as 'text-underline-position', 'color', 'stroke', or 'fill')
	when rendering these decorations.
	However,
	to the extent that honoring any of these properties
	would be meaningful and practical
	given the UA's chosen rendering,
	the UA <em>should</em> apply them
	as modifications to its default styling.

<h3 id="text-decoration-style-property">
Text Decoration Style: the 'text-decoration-style' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-decoration-style
	Value: solid | double | dotted | dashed | wavy
	Initial: solid
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: specified keyword
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	This property,
	which is a <a>sub-property</a> of the 'text-decoration' shorthand,
	sets the line-drawing style of underlines, overlines, and line-throughs
	specified on the element with 'text-decoration-line',
	and affects all decorations originating from this element
	even if descendant boxes specify a different style.

	Values have the same meaning as for the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#the-border-style">border-style properties</a> [[!CSS-BACKGROUNDS-3]].
	<dfn value for=text-decoration-style>wavy</dfn> indicates a wavy line.

<h3 id="text-decoration-color-property">
Text Decoration Color: the 'text-decoration-color' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-decoration-color
	Value: <<color>>
	Initial: currentcolor
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: computed color
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	This property,
	which is a <a>sub-property</a> of the 'text-decoration' shorthand,
	sets the color of underlines, overlines, and line-throughs
	specified on the element with 'text-decoration-line',
	and affects all decorations originating from this element
	even if descendant boxes specify a different color.

<h3 id="text-decoration-width-property">
Text Decoration Line Thickness: the 'text-decoration-thickness' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-decoration-thickness
	Value: auto | from-font | <<length>> | <<percentage>>
	Initial: auto
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: specified keyword or absolute length
	Animation type: by computed value
	</pre>

	This property,
	which is a <a>sub-property</a> of the 'text-decoration' shorthand,
	sets the stroke thickness of underlines, overlines, and line-throughs
	specified on the element with 'text-decoration-line',
	and affects all decorations originating from this element
	even if descendant boxes specify a different thickness.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=text-decoration-thickness dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			The UA chooses an appropriate thickness for text decoration lines;
			see below.

		<dt><dfn>from-font</dfn>
		<dd>
			If the <a>first available font</a> has
			metrics indicating a preferred underline width,
			use that width,
			otherwise behaves as ''text-decoration-thickness/auto''.

		<dt><dfn><<length>></dfn>
		<dd>
			Specifies the thickness of text decoration lines as a fixed length.
			The UA must floor the actual value at one device pixel.

			Note: A length will inherit as a fixed value,
			and will not scale with the font.

		<dt><dfn><<percentage>>
		<dd>
			<p>Specifies the thickness of text decoration lines as a percentage of ''1em''.
			The UA must floor the actual value at one device pixel.

			Note: A percentage will inherit as a relative value,
			and will therefore scale with changes in the font as it inherits.
	</dl>

<h4 id="text-decoration-thickness">
Automatic Thickness of Text Decoration Lines</h4>

	Some font formats (such as OpenType) can offer information
	about the appropriate thickness of a line decoration.
	The UA should use such font-based information
	when choosing ''text-decoration-thickness/auto'' line thicknesses
	wherever appropriate.

<h3 id="line-position">
Determining the Position and Thickness of Line Decorations</h3>

	Issue: This section is copied over from early drafts of Text Decoration Level 3.
	It is still under review, and needs integration with 'text-underline-offset' and 'text-decoration-thickness'.

	Since line decorations can span elements with varying font sizes and
	vertical alignments, the best position for a line decoration is not
	necessarily the ideal position dictated by the <a>decorating box</a>.
	Instead, it's calculated, per line, from all text decorated by the <a>decorating box</a> on that line,
	the <dfn>considered text</dfn>.
	However, descendants of the <a>decorating box</a>
	that are skipped due to 'text-decoration-skip',
	descendant inlines with ''text-decoration-skip: ink'',
	and any descendants that do not participate in the <a>decorating box</a>’s inline formatting context
	are excluded from the set of <a>considered text</a>.

	The line decoration positions are then calculated
	per line
	as follows
	(treating <a>over</a>-positioned underlines</a> as <a>over</a> lines
	and <a>under</a>-positioned overlines</a> as <a>under</a> lines):

	<dl>
		<dt><a>over</a> lines
		<dd>
			Align the line decoration with respect to the highest
			<a>over</a> EM-box edge
			of the <a>considered text</a>.

		<dt><a>alphabetic</a> underlines
		<dd>
			The alphabetic underline position is calculated by taking
			the ideal offset (from the alphabetic baseline) of each run of <a>considered text</a>,
			averaging those, and then using the lowest alphabetic baseline to actually position the line.
			(Alphabetic baselines can differ between ''vertical-align/baseline''-aligned boxes
			 if the dominant baseline is non-alphabetic.)
			To prevent superscripts and subscripts from throwing this position off-kilter,
			an inline with a non-initial computed 'vertical-align'
			is treated as having the ideal underline position of its parent.

		<dt>non-alphabetic <a>under</a> lines
		<dd>
			Position the line decoration with respect to the lowest
			<a>under</a> EM-box edge
			of the <a>considered text</a>.

		<dt>line-throughs
		<dd>
			Line-throughs essentially use the same sort of averaging as for alphabetic underlines,
			but recompute the position when drawing across a descendant with a different computed 'font-size'.
			(This ensures that the text remains effectively “crossed out” despite any font size changes.)
			For each run of <a>considered text</a> with the same 'font-size',
			compute an ideal position averaged from its font metrics.
			To prevent superscripts and subscripts from throwing this position off-kilter,
			an inline with a non-initial computed 'vertical-align'
			is treated as having the ideal underline position of its parent.
			Position the portion of the line across each decorated fragment at that position.

			<p class='issue'>
				For simplicity, line-throughs should draw over each element at that element's preferred/averaged position.
				This can produce some undesirable jumpiness,
				but there doesn't appear to be any way to avoid that which is correct in all instances,
				and all attempts are worryingly complex.
				What position should line-throughs adopt over elements that have a different font-size,
				but no <a>considered text</a>?
	</dl>

	CSS does not define the thickness of line decorations.
	In determining the thickness of text decoration lines,
	user agents may consider the font sizes, faces, and weights of descendants
	to provide an appropriately averaged thickness.

	<div class="example">
		The following figure shows the averaging for underline:
		<p><img alt="In the first rendering of the underlined text '1st a'
								 with 'st' as a superscript, both the '1st' and the 'a'
								 are rendered in a small font. In the second rendering,
								 the 'a' is rendered in a larger font. In the third, both
								 '1st' and 'a' are large."
						height="105" src="images/underline-averaging.gif" width="326">

		In the three fragments of underlined text, the underline is drawn
			consecutively lower and thicker as the ratio of large text to small
			text increases.</p>

		Using the same example, a line-through would in the second fragment,
		instead of averaging the two font sizes,
		split the line-through into two segments:
		<p><img alt="" src="images/linethrough-averaging.gif">

		In both cases, however, the superscript, due to the vertical-alignment shift,
		has no effect on the position of the line.
	</div>

<h3 id="text-decoration-property">
Text Decoration Shorthand: the 'text-decoration' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef shorthand">
	Name: text-decoration
	Value: <<'text-decoration-line'>> || <<'text-decoration-thickness'>> || <<'text-decoration-style'>> || <<'text-decoration-color'>>
	</pre>

	This property is a shorthand for setting
	'text-decoration-line',
	'text-decoration-thickness',
	'text-decoration-style',
	and 'text-decoration-color'
	in one declaration.
	Omitted values are set to their initial values.

	Note: A 'text-decoration' declaration that omits
	both the 'text-decoration-color' and 'text-decoration-style' values
	is backwards-compatible with CSS Levels 1 and 2.

	<div class="example">
		The following example underlines unvisited links with a solid blue
		underline in CSS1 and CSS2 UAs and a navy dotted underline in CSS3 UAs.

		<pre>
			:link {
			  color: blue;
			  text-decoration: underline;
			  text-decoration: navy dotted underline; /* <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#ignore">Ignored</a> in CSS1/CSS2 UAs */
			}
		</pre>
	</div>

	Note: The shorthand purposefully omits the 'text-underline-position' property,
	which is a language/writing-system–dependent setting that keys off the content,
	so that it can cascade and inherit independently
	from the (uninherited) stylistic settings of the 'text-decoration' shorthand.


<h3 id="text-underline-position-property">
Text Underline Position: the 'text-underline-position' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-underline-position
	Value: auto | [ from-font | under ] || [ left | right ]
	Initial: auto
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Computed value: specified keyword(s)
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	This property,
	which is <em>not</em> a <a>sub-property</a> of the 'text-decoration' shorthand,
	sets the position of an underline with respect to the text,
	and defines its [=zero position=] for further adjustment by 'text-underline-offset'.
	It affects all decorations originating from this element,
	even if descendant boxes specify a different position.
	It does not affect underlines specified by ancestor elements.

	<div class="example">
		The following example styles modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
		texts with the appropriate underline positions in both horizontal
		and vertical text:
		<pre>
			:root:lang(ja), [lang|=ja], :root:lang(ko), [lang|=ko] { text-underline-position: under right; }
			:root:lang(zh), [lang|=zh] { text-underline-position: under left; }
		</pre>
	</div>

	If ''text-underline-position/left'' or ''text-underline-position/right'' is specified alone,
	''text-underline-position/auto'' is also implied.
	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=text-underline-position>
		<dt><dfn id="underline-auto">auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			The user agent may use any algorithm to determine the
			underline's position; however it must be placed at or under
			the alphabetic baseline.

			Note: It is suggested that the default underline position
			be close to the alphabetic baseline,
			unless that would either cross subscripted (or otherwise lowered) text
			or draw over glyphs from Asian scripts such as Han or Tibetan
			for which an alphabetic underline is too high:
			in such cases, shifting the underline lower
			or aligning to the em box edge as described for ''text-underline-position/under''
			may be more appropriate.

			<div class="figure">
				<img title="text-underline-position: alphabetic"
				    alt="In a typical Latin font, the underline is positioned slightly
				         below the alphabetic baseline, leaving a gap between the line
				         and the bottom of most Latin letters, but crossing through
				         descenders such as the stem of a 'p'."
				    src="images/underline-position-alphabetic.png" >
				<p class="caption">A typical “alphabetic” underline is positioned just below the alphabetic baseline
			</div>

		<dt><dfn>from-font</dfn>
		<dd>
			If the <a>first available font</a> has
			metrics indicating a preferred underline offset,
			use that offset,
			otherwise behaves as ''text-underline-offset/auto''.

		<dt><dfn id="underline-under">under</dfn>
		<dd>
			The underline is positioned <i>under</i> the element's text content.
			In this case the underline usually does not cross the descenders.
			(This is sometimes called “accounting” underline.)
			This value can be combined with ''text-underline-position/left'' or ''text-underline-position/right''
			if a particular side is preferred in vertical <a>typographic modes</a>.
			<div class="figure">
			  <img title="text-underline-position: under"
			      alt="In a typical Latin font, the underline is far enough
			           below the text that it does not cross the bottom of a 'g'."
			      src="images/underline-position-under.png">
			  <p class="caption">''text-underline-position: under''
			</div>
			<div class="example">
				Because 'text-underline-position' inherits, and is not reset
				by the 'text-decoration' shorthand, the following example
				switches the document to use ''text-underline-position/under'' underlining, which can
				be more appropriate for writing systems  with long, complicated
				descenders. It is also often useful for mathematical or chemical
				texts that use many subscripts.

				<pre>:root { text-underline-position: under; }</pre>
			</div>

			Note: The ''text-decoration/under'' value does not guarantee
			that the underline will not conflict with glyphs,
			as some fonts have descenders or diacritics
			that extend below the font’s descent metrics.

		<dt><dfn id="underline-left">left</dfn>
		<dd>
			In vertical <a>typographic modes</a>, the underline is aligned as for
			''text-underline-position/under'', except it is always aligned to the left edge of the text.
			If this causes the underline to be drawn on the "over" side of
			the text, then an overline also switches sides and is drawn on
			the "under" side.

		<dd>
			In vertical <a>typographic modes</a>, the underline is aligned as for

	Name: text-underline-offset
	Value: auto | <<length>> | <<percentage>>
	Initial: auto
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: specified keyword or absolute length
	Animation type: by computed value
	</pre>

	This property,
	which is <em>not</em> a <a>sub-property</a> of the 'text-decoration' shorthand,
	sets the offset of underlines from their [=zero position=].
	Positive offsets represent distances outward from the text;
	negative offsets inward.
	It affects all decorations originating from this element,
	even if descendant boxes specify a different position.
	It does not affect underlines specified by ancestor elements.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=text-underline-offset dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			<p>The UA chooses an appropriate offset for underlines.

			However, this offset must be zero
			if the computed value of 'text-underline-position' is ''text-underline-position/from-font''
			and the UA was able to extract an appropriate metric to use
			from the font.

		<dt><dfn><<length>>
		<dd>
			<p>Specifies the offset of underlines as a fixed length.

			Note: A length will inherit as a fixed value,
			and will not scale with the font.

		<dt><dfn><<percentage>>
		<dd>
			<p>Specifies the offset of underlines as a percentage of ''1em''.

			Note: A percentage will inherit as a relative value,
			and will therefore scale with changes in the font as it inherits.
	</dl>

	When the value of the 'text-decoration-line' property is either
	''spelling-error'' or ''grammar-error'',
	the UA may ignore the value of 'text-underline-position'.

<h4 id="line-offset-zero">
Underline Offset Origin (Zero Position)</h4>

	The <dfn lt="underline zero position" local-lt="zero position">zero position</dfn> of the underline
	depends on the value of 'text-underline-position'
	as detailed below.

	<table class="data">
		<caption>Interaction of 'text-underline-position' and 'text-underline-offset'
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>'text-underline-position'
				<th>Zero Position
				<th>Positive Direction
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>''text-underline-position/auto''
				<td>alphabetic baseline
				<td><a>under</a>
			<tr>
				<td>''text-underline-position/from-font''
				<td>position specified by the font metrics, falling back to alphabetic baseline
				<td><a>under</a>
			<tr>
				<td>''text-underline-position/under''
				<td>text-under edge
				<td><a>under</a>
			<tr>
				<td>''text-underline-position/left''
				<td>text-under (left) edge
				<td><a>under</a>
			<tr>
				<td>''text-underline-position/right''
				<td>text-over (right) edge
				<td><a>over</a>
	</table>

	The underline is aligned to the outside of the specified position
	(extending its thickness in the positive direction only).

	Any automatic adjustments made to accommodate descendant content are maintained;
	the 'text-underline-offset' is in addition to those.

<h4 id="line-auto-offset">
Using Font Metrics for Automatic Positioning</h4>

	Some font formats (such as OpenType) can offer information
	about the appropriate position of a line decoration.
	The UA should use such font-based information
	in its choice of ''text-underline-offset/auto'' offset
	wherever appropriate,
	and must use such information
	when ''text-underline-position/from-font'' is specified for 'text-underline-position'.

	Note: Typically, OpenType font metrics give the position
	of an ''text-underline-position/alphabetic'' underline;
	in some cases (especially in CJK fonts),
	it gives the position of a ''under left'' underline.
	(In this case, the font's underline metrics typically
	touch the bottom edge of the em box).
	The UA may but is not required to correct for incorrect font metrics.

<h3 id="text-line-constancy">
Text Decoration Line Uniformity</h3>

	The exact position and thickness of line decorations
	depends on the values of
	'text-underline-position', 'text-underline-offset', and 'text-decoration-thickness'
	as defined above,
	and is otherwise UA-defined.
	However, for underlines and overlines
	the UA must use a single thickness and position on each line
	for the decorations deriving from a single <i>decorating box</i>.

	<div class="figure">
		<img src="images/underline-single.png"
		        alt="A single underline drawn under varying font sizes and vertical positions must be a single line.">
		   vs.
		   <img src="images/underline-broken.png"
		        alt="Drawing multiple line segments, each with the position and thickness appropriate to the decorated text, is incorrect.">
		<p class="caption">Correct and incorrect rendering of <code>&lt;u>A&lt;sup>B&lt;/sup>&lt;big>C&lt;/big>D&lt;/u></code>
	</div>

	<div class="note">
		Note, since line decorations can span elements with varying font sizes and
		vertical alignments, the best position for a line decoration is not
		necessarily the ideal position dictated by the <i>decorating box</i>.
		For example, an overline positioned to a small font
		will effectively become a line-through if the element contains text in a significantly larger font-size.
		Even for underlines, if the text is not aligned to the alphabetic baseline
		(for example, in vertical typesetting styles,
		text is aligned by its central baseline by default [[CSS-WRITING-MODES-4]])
		an underline will cut through descendant text of a larger font-size.
		UA consideration of descendant content will therefore result in better typography.

		<div class="figure">
		  <img src="images/leftline-cross.png" alt="">
		     <img src="images/leftline-under.png" alt="">
		  <p class="caption">
		    Due to the central baseline alignment of vertical text,
		    a left-side underline on small vertical text will cut through the text
		    of a child with a larger font size.
		    The underline is not allowed to be broken,
		    but adjusting its position further to the left
		    properly accommodates all of the underlined text.
		</div>
	</div>

	UAs <em>must</em> adjust line positions
	to match the shifted metrics of <i>decorating boxes</i> shifted
	with 'vertical-align' values other than ''vertical-align/baseline'' [[!CSS2]]
	or subscripted/superscripted via 'font-variant-position' [[!CSS-FONTS-3]],
	but <em>must not</em> adjust the line position or thickness
	in response to descendants of a <i>decorating box</i> that are so styled
	(even though it <em>may</em> adjust the position
	to accommodate descendants that are not so styled,
	such as those merely typeset in a different font size as noted above).
	This allows superscripts and subscripts to be properly decorated
	(underlined, struck through, etc.)
	but prevents them from distorting or breaking the positioning of such decorations on their ancestors.

	<div class="figure">
		<img src="images/underline-superscript.png"
		        alt="An underline for just the superscript 'st' in '1st' is drawn just below the superscript,

Text Decoration Line Continuity: the 'text-decoration-skip' shorthand and its sub-properties</h3>

	Issue: The CSSWG resolved to be split skipping functionality into individual properties

	This property only applies to overlines and underlines;

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-skip-ink">auto</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			UAs <em>may</em> interrupt underlines and overlines
			where the line would cross glyph ink
			and to some distance to either side of the glyph outline.

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-skip-ink">all</dfn></dt>
		<dd>

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-skip-ink">none</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			UA <em>must</em> draw continuous underlines and overlines,
			without interruptions when they cross over a glyph.
	</dl>

	<div class="note">
        Note: Implementation experience shows that ink-skipping behavior often
        produces undesirable results when underlined text includes ideographic characters,
        as the underline position (depending on the font and user agent involved)
        often clashes with almost all the glyphs,
        such that only occasional fragments of the line remain to be rendered.

        In principle, this could be resolved by authors using
        ''text-underline-position: under'' (or possibly 'text-underline-offset')
        to move the underline to a lower position that does not clash with the glyphs,
        but this is not always feasible, even if the user agent supports these properties
        and the author is aware of their potential.
        In particular, when a page contains arbitrary user-generated content,
        the author responsible for the design may not know whether CJK content will be present.
        And with mixed-script content,
        an underline position designed to work well for CJK content
        may look bad if the majority of the text is non-CJK.

        Therefore, when ''text-decoration-skip-ink/auto'' is in effect,
        a UA that implements ink-skipping <em>should</em> refrain from doing so in CJK contexts.
        (Authors who <em>do</em> want ink-skipping applied to CJK content can use
        the ''text-decoration-skip-ink/always'' value to explicitly request this.)

        Primarily, this means <em>not</em> applying ink-skipping for characters whose
        Unicode <a href="http://unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/Scripts.txt">Script property</a>
        is any of the CJK scripts Han, Hiragana, Katakana, Bopomofo, or Hangul,
        or for characters whose Script property is Inherited or Common,
        and whose <a href="http://unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/ScriptExtensions.txt">ScriptExtensions property</a>
        includes one or more of the CJK scripts.

        In addition, characters with a Unicode script property of Common and Inherited
        (primarily generic punctuation and symbols) need to be considered,
        as these may be used as part of a run of CJK-script content,
        and it is desirable to treat all text within a given script run in a consistent way.
        Therefore, the UA <em>should</em> resolve the text into script runs
        as described in the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/#Usage_Model">“Implementation Notes”</a>
        of [[!UAX24]] “Unicode Script Property”, in particular subsections 5.1 and 5.2.
        After applying the heuristics described there (or a similar analysis of scripts),
        the UA <em>should</em> disable ink-skipping for all ranges of text
        that are determined to be in a CJK script.

        Issue: Are there other (non-CJK) scripts where it would be preferable
        to disable ink-skipping by default
        (when ''text-decoration-skip-ink/auto'' is in effect)?
        Perhaps Yi? Arabic?

<h4 id="ink-skip-shape">
Shaping Interruptions</h4>

	When the UA interrupts underlines or overlines at glyph boundaries,
	the shape of the line at that boundary should
	follow the shape of the glyph.

	<div class="note">
		Note, this specification intentionally does not mandate a particular method
		for “following the shape” of the glyph
		so that UAs can take appropriate measures to handle
		aesthetic and performance considerations.
		For example,
		a UA could assume square line endings below a certain size threshold
		for performance reasons;
		or use trapezoidal endings to approximate curves,
		especially on thinner line decorations.
		In terms of aesthetic considerations,
		the UA might also consider what happens when the glyph boundary
		intersects only part of the line thickness
		or is slanted close to the horizontal--
		following the curve exactly
		could result in typographically-awkward wisps of underline.
		Whether to show the line within enclosed areas of a glyph is yet
		another consideration.

		<div class="figure">
			<img title="Wispy Leftovers of a Masked-Out Underline"
			       alt="Take, for example, the word “goal” with an underline striking through the bottom loop of the “g”.
			            Depending on the position and thickness of the underline,
			            we might see the entire thickness of the underline, or only part of it within the “g”.
			            This example shows a masked-out underline in two positions.
			            In the left pair the underline passes through the center of the bowl of the “g”:
			            the full thickness of the underline shows through the center,
			            filling it.
			            In the right pair the underline is slightly lower,
			            and thus the portion of the underline within the “g” can only show a partial thickness."
			       src="images/skip-ink-wisp.png">
			<p class="caption">
			Hiding the portion of the underline within the bowl gives a cleaner look to the type,
			while the curved ends of the underline outside it
			suggest the continuity of the underline through the letter

<h2 id="emphasis-marks">
Additional Controls for Emphasis Marks</h2>

	East Asian documents traditionally use small symbols next to each glyph to emphasize
	a run of text. For example:

	<div class="figure">
		<img alt="Example of emphasis in Japanese appearing over the text"
		     src="images/text-emphasis-ja.png" height="39" width="208">
		<p class="caption">Accent emphasis (shown in blue for clarity) applied to Japanese text
	</div>

	The 'text-emphasis' shorthand, and its 'text-emphasis-style' and 'text-emphasis-color' longhands,
	can be used to apply such marks to the text.
	The 'text-emphasis-position' property, which inherits separately,
	allows setting the emphasis marks’ position with respect to the text.

	If a shape keyword is specified but neither of ''filled'' nor ''open'' is
	specified, ''filled'' is assumed. If only ''filled'' or ''open'' is specified,
	the shape keyword computes to ''text-emphasis-style/circle'' in horizontal <a>typographic modes</a> and
	''sesame'' in vertical <a>typographic modes</a>.

	The marks should be drawn using the element's font settings
	with the addition of the ''font-variant-east-asian/ruby'' feature
	and the size scaled down 50%.
	However, since not all fonts have all these glyphs,
	and some fonts use inappropriate sizes for emphasis marks in these code points,
	the UA may opt to use a font known to be good for emphasis marks,
	or the marks may instead be synthesized by the UA.
	Marks must remain upright in vertical <a>typographic modes</a>:
	like CJK characters, they do not rotate to match the writing mode.
	The orientation of marks in horizontal <a>typographic modes</a> of vertical <a>writing modes</a>
	is undefined in this level
	(but may be defined in a future level if definitive use cases arise).

	Note: One example of good fonts for emphasis marks is Adobe's open source
	<a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/kenten-generic">Kenten Generic OpenType Font</a>,
	which is specially designed for the emphasis marks.


	The marks are drawn once for each <a>typographic character unit</a>.
	However, emphasis marks are <em>not</em> drawn for:

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#word-separator">Word separators</a>
			or other <a>characters</a> that
			belong to the Unicode separator classes (Z*).

			 that combines with any combining characters.)

	Value: <<color>>
	Initial: currentcolor
	Applies to: text
	Inherited: yes
	Computed value: computed color
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	This property specifies the foreground color of the emphasis marks.

	Note: ''currentcolor'' keyword computes to itself
	and is resolved to the value of 'color' after inheritance is performed.
	This means 'text-emphasis-color' by default matches the text 'color'
	even as 'color' changes across elements.

<h3 id="text-emphasis-property">
Emphasis Mark Shorthand: the 'text-emphasis' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef shorthand">
	Name: text-emphasis
	Value: <<'text-emphasis-style'>> || <<'text-emphasis-color'>>
	</pre>

	This property is a shorthand for setting
	'text-emphasis-style' and 'text-emphasis-color'
	in one declaration.
	Omitted values are set to their initial values.

	<p class="note">Note that 'text-emphasis-position' is not reset in this
	shorthand. This is because typically the shape and color vary, but the
	position is consistent for a particular language throughout the document.
	Therefore the position should inherit independently.

<h3 id="text-emphasis-position-property">
Emphasis Mark Position: the 'text-emphasis-position' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">

	Initial: over right
	Applies to: text
	Inherited: yes
	Computed value: specified keyword(s)
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	This property describes where emphasis marks are drawn at.
	If ''[ right | left ]'' is omitted, it defaults to ''text-emphasis-position/right''.
	The values have following meanings:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=text-emphasis-position>

		<dd>Draw marks over the text in horizontal <a>typographic modes</a>.

		<dt><dfn>left</dfn>
		<dd>Draw marks to the left of the text in vertical <a>typographic modes</a>.
	</dl>

	Emphasis marks are drawn exactly as if each character was
	assigned the mark as its ruby annotation text with the ruby position
	given by 'text-emphasis-position' and the ruby alignment as centered.
	Note that this position may be adjusted if it would conflict
	with underline or overline decorations.

	The effect of emphasis marks on the line height is the same as for
	ruby text.

	<div class="note">

	If emphasis marks are applied to characters
	for which ruby is drawn in the same position as the emphasis mark,
	the emphasis marks are placed outside the ruby.

<!--

Some notes from Koji :

	Here's what Kobayashi-sensei and I've got.

	We have categorized to:
	1. Controls
	2. Spaces
	3. Connectors
	4. Symbols
	5. Delimiters

	>From these groups, his recommendation is not to put emphasis marks to any of these by default, including symbols.

	1 is C* except Co as we discussed, and 2 is Z*. These are easy.

	3: Connectors are Pc and Pd, plus U+30FB KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT. They are used to "connect", rather than "delimit".

	4: Symbols include more than we have in the spec; #, &, %, @, $, ...

	5: Delimiters are comma, full-stops, parenthesis, etc.; they're used to "delimit".

	Category Po is tough one, as I expected (and you might as well I guess :). By looking at his examples, it has 3, 4, and 5, all mixed.

	Here're options I came up:

	OPTION 1: Categorize every code point of Po (there are 402) into 3, 4, and 5, and list them up in the spec.
	OPTION 2: UAX #29 Text Segmentation: Sentence=Close|ATerm|SContinue|STerm are 5, in addition to Ps, Pe, Pi, Pf, and other Po are 4.
	OPTION 3: More simplified; just make all Po as 4: Symbols. It includes full-stops for instance which is not ideal, but simple. Either way, default is ok (if we make symbols to skip by default as Kobayashi-sensei suggested.)

	My preference is OPTION 2, I'm ok with 3. I don't like 1. What do you think?

	U+30FB still cannot be handled, so we could make it as the only exception, but I think just ignoring it is also acceptable (authors still can specify "keep-symbol" to put emphasis marks on them.)

	Three more things I'd like to have your opinions:
	1. Name of value for "connectors": connectors, dashes, hyphens?
	2. What do you think to skip-narrow by default? I have no idea how common emphasis marks for Tibetan is, but his definition includes skip-narrow.
	3. If we take Kobayashi-sensei's list, skip-symbols is also default, so most values other than skip-narrow is "keep-*". Maybe we should change property name?

	I'm copying all Sentence=Close|ATerm|SContinue|STerm for your reference, but you can play with the spreadsheet either on Windows Live or Google docs if you'd like:

<h2 id="text-shadow-property">
Text Shadows: the 'text-shadow' property</h2>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-shadow
	Value: none | [ <<color>>? && <<length>>{2,4} ]#
	Initial: none
	Applies to: text
	Inherited: yes
	Computed value: either the keyword ''box-shadow/none'' or
		a list, each item consisting of four absolute lengths
		plus a computed color
	Animation type: by computed value,
		treating ''box-shadow/none'' as a zero-item list
		and appending blank shadows (''transparent 0 0 0 0'')
		as needed to match the longer list
		if the shorter list is otherwise compatible with the longer one
	</pre>

	This property accepts a comma-separated list of shadow effects
	to be applied to the text of the element.
	Values are interpreted as for 'box-shadow' [[!CSS-BACKGROUNDS-3]].
	(But note that the ''box-shadow/inset'' keyword are not allowed.)
	Each layer shadows the element's text and all its text decorations
	(composited together).
	If the color of the shadow is not specified,
	it defaults to ''currentColor'',
	i.e. the shadow’s color is taken from the element’s 'color' property.

	The shadow effects are applied front-to-back:
	the first shadow is on top.
	The shadows may thus overlay each other,
	but they never overlay the text itself.
	The shadow must be painted at a stack level
	between the element's border and/or background (if present)
	and the elements text and text decoration.
	UAs should avoid painting text shadows over text
	in adjacent elements belonging to the same stack level and stacking context.
	(This may mean that the exact stack level of the shadows depends
	on whether the element has a border or background:
	the exact stacking behavior of text shadows is thus UA-defined.)
	It is undefined whether a given shadow layer shadows
	each glyph or decoration independently
	or if the text and/or decorations are flattened and then shadowed.

	Unlike 'box-shadow', text shadows are not clipped to the shadowed shape
	and may show through if the text is partially-transparent.
	Like 'box-shadow', text shadows do not influence layout,
	and do not trigger scrolling
	or increase the size of the <a>scrollable overflow region</a>.

	Also unlike 'box-shadow',
	the [=spread distance=] is strictly interpreted as outset distance
	from any point of the glyph outline,
	and therefore, similar to the blur radius,
	creates rounded, rather than sharp, corners.

	Note: The painting order of shadows defined here is the opposite
	of that defined in the 1998
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512">CSS2 Recommendation</a>.

	The ''text-shadow'' property applies to both the
	<code>::first-line</code> and <code>::first-letter</code>
	pseudo-elements.

	Level 4 adds a spread radius argument to 'text-shadow',
	using the same syntax and interpretation as for 'box-shadow',
	except that corners are always rounded
	(since the geometry of a glyph is not so simple as a box).


<h2 id="painting">
Painting Text Decorations</h2>

<h3 id="painting-order">
Painting Order of Text Decorations</h3>

	As in [[!CSS2]], text decorations are drawn immediately over/under the text they decorate,
	in the following order (bottommost first):

	<ul>
		<li>shadows ('text-shadow')
		<li>underlines ('text-decoration')
		<li>overlines ('text-decoration')
		<li>text
		<li>emphasis marks ('text-emphasis')
		<li>line-through ('text-decoration')
	</ul>


	Where line decorations are drawn across box decorations or atomic inlines,
	they are drawn over non-positioned content and just below any positioned descendants
	(immediately below layer #8 in CSS2.1 Appendix E).

<h3 id="overflow">
Overflow of Text Decorations</h3>

	Text decorations that leak outside a <a>box</a>
	are considered <a>ink overflow</a>:
	they do not extend the <a>scrollable overflow region</a>.
	[[css-overflow-3]]

Appendix B: Default UA Stylesheet</h2>


	This appendix is informative,
	and is to help UA developers to implement default stylesheet,
	but UA developers are free to ignore or change.

	<div class="example">
		<pre><code class="css">
		  /* typical styling of HTML */
		  blink {
		    text-decoration-line: blink;
		  }
		  s, strike, del {
		    text-decoration: line-through;
		  }
		  u, ins, :link, :visited {
		    text-decoration: underline;
		  }
		  abbr[title], acronym[title] {
		    text-decoration: dotted underline;
		  }

		  /* disable inheritance of text-emphasis marks to ruby text:
		    emphasis marks should only apply to base text */
		  rt { text-emphasis: none; }

		  /* set language-appropriate default emphasis mark position */
		  :root:lang(zh), [lang|=zh] { text-emphasis-position: under right; }
		  [lang|=ja], [lang|=ko]     { text-emphasis-position: over right; }

		  /* set language-appropriate default underline position */
		  :root:lang(ja), [lang|=ja],
		  :root:lang(mn), [lang|=mn],
		  :root:lang(ko), [lang|=ko] { text-underline-position: right; }
		  :root:lang(zh), [lang|=zh] { text-underline-position: left;  }
		  /* auto is chosen (implied) above instead of under
		     due to content-compatibility concerns */
		</code></pre>
	</div>

	<p class="issue">
		If you find any issues, recommendations to add, or corrections,
		please send the information to <a href="mailto:www-style@w3.org">www-style@w3.org</a>
		with <kbd>[css-text-decor]</kbd> in the subject line.

	<div class='example'>
		While ''text-decoration-line: blink'' can't be fully reproduced with other existing properties,
		authors can achieve a very similar effect with the following CSS:

		<pre>
			@keyframes blink {
			  0% {
			    visibility: hidden;
			    animation-timing-function: step-end;
			  }
			  25%, 100% {
			    visibility: visible;
			  }
			}
			blink {
			  animation: blink 1s infinite;
			}
		</pre>
