<h2 id=intro>Introduction</h2>

	This is the initial draft of CSS Text Decoration Level 4;
	it is being maintained as a diff spec against <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3/">CSS Text Decoration Level 3</a>.


<h2 id="line-decoration">
Additional Controls for Line Decorations</h2>

<h3 id="text-decoration-line-property">
Text Decoration Lines: the 'text-decoration-line' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-decoration-line
	Value: none | [ underline || overline || line-through || blink ] | spelling-error | grammar-error
	Initial: none
	Inherited: no (but see prose, above)
	Computed value: specified keyword(s)
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	Specifies what line decorations, if any, are added to the element.
	Values have the following meanings:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-line">none</dfn>
		<dd>
			Neither produces nor inhibits text decoration.

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-line">underline</dfn>
		<dd>
			Each line of text is underlined.

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-line">overline</dfn>
		<dd>
			Each line of text has a line over it
			(i.e. on the opposite side from an underline).

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-line">line-through</dfn>
		<dd>
			Each line of text has a line through the middle.

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-line">blink</dfn>
		<dd>
			The text blinks (alternates between visible and invisible).
			Conforming user agents may simply not blink the text.
			Note that not blinking the text is one technique to satisfy
			<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG/guidelines.html#tech-on-off-blinking-text">checkpoint 3.3 of WAI-UAAG</a>.
			This value is <strong>deprecated</strong>
			in favor of Animations [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]].

		<dt><dfn value for="text-tecoration-line">spelling-error</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value indicates the type of text decoration
			used by the User Agent to highlight spelling mistakes.
			Its appearance is UA-defined,
			and may be platform-dependent.
			<span class=note>It is often rendered as a red wavy underline.</span>

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-line">grammar-error</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value indicates the type of text decoration
			used by the User Agent to highlight grammar mistakes.
			Its appearance is UA defined,
			and may be platform-dependent.
			<span class=note>It is often rendered as a green wavy underline.</span>
	</dl>

	Note: In <a>vertical writing modes</a>,
	'text-underline-position' can cause the underline and overline to switch sides.
	This allows the position of underlines to key off of language-specific preferences
	automatically.

	Since ''spelling-error'' and ''grammar-error'' decorations are entirely UA-defined,
	the UA <em>may</em> disregard
	the other <a>sub-properties</a> of 'text-decoration',
	as well any other properties typically affecting the appearance of line decorations
	(such as 'text-underline-position', 'color', 'stroke', or 'fill')
	when rendering these decorations.
	However,
	to the extent that honoring any of these properties
	would be meaningful and practical
	given the UA's chosen rendering,
	the UA <em>should</em> apply them
	as modifications to its default styling.

<h3 id="text-decoration-width-property">
Text Decoration Line Thickness: the 'text-decoration-width' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-decoration-width
	Value: auto | from-font | <<length>>
	Initial: auto
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: no
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: specified keyword or absolute length
	Animation type: by computed value
	</pre>

	This property, which is also a <a>sub-property</a> of the 'text-decoration' shorthand,
	sets the stroke thickness of underlines, overlines, and line-throughs.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=text-decoration-width dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			The UA chooses an appropriate thickness for text decoration lines;
			see below.

		<dt><dfn>from-font</dfn>
		<dd>
			If the <a>first available font</a> has
			metrics indicating a preferred underline width,
			use that width,
			otherwise behaves as ''text-decoration-width/auto''.

		<dt><dfn><<length>></dfn>
		<dd>
			Specifies the thickness of text decoration lines as a length.
			The UA must floor the actual value at one device pixel.
			Authors are strongly encouraged to use ''em'' units
			so that the line thickness scales with the font.
	</dl>

<h4 id="text-decoration-thickness">
Automatic Thickness of Text Decoration Lines</h4>

	Issue: Insert L3 text here.

<h3 id="line-position">
Determining the Position and Thickness of Line Decorations</h3>

	Issue: This section is copied over from early drafts of Text Decoration Level 3.
	It is still under review, and needs integration with 'text-underline-offset' and 'text-decoration-width'.

	<p>Since line decorations can span elements with varying font sizes and
		vertical alignments, the best position for a line decoration is not
		necessarily the ideal position dictated by the <a>decorating box</a>.
		Instead, it's calculated, per line, from all text decorated by the <a>decorating box</a> on that line,
		the <dfn>considered text</dfn>.
		However, descendants of the <a>decorating box</a>
		that are skipped due to 'text-decoration-skip',
		descendant inlines with ''text-decoration-skip: ink'',
		and any descendants that do not participate in the <a>decorating box</a>’s inline formatting context
		are excluded from the set of <a>considered text</a>.

	<p>
		The line decoration positions are then calculated
		per line
		as follows
		(treating <a>over</a>-positioned underlines</a> as <a>over</a> lines
		and <a>under</a>-positioned overlines</a> as <a>under</a> lines):

	<dl>
		<dt><a>over</a> lines
		<dd>
			Align the line decoration with respect to the highest
			<a>over</a> EM-box edge
			of the <a>considered text</a>.

		<dt><a>alphabetic</a> underlines
		<dd>
			<p>The alphabetic underline position is calculated by taking
			the ideal offset (from the alphabetic baseline) of each run of <a>considered text</a>,
			averaging those, and then using the lowest alphabetic baseline to actually position the line.
			(Alphabetic baselines can differ between ''vertical-align/baseline''-aligned boxes
			 if the dominant baseline is non-alphabetic.)
			To prevent superscripts and subscripts from throwing this position off-kilter,
			an inline with a non-initial computed 'vertical-align'
			is treated as having the ideal underline position of its parent.

		<dt>non-alphabetic <a>under</a> lines
		<dd>
			Position the line decoration with respect to the lowest
			<a>under</a> EM-box edge
			of the <a>considered text</a>.

		<dt>line-throughs
		<dd>
			Line-throughs essentially use the same sort of averaging as for alphabetic underlines,
			but recompute the position when drawing across a descendant with a different computed 'font-size'.
			(This ensures that the text remains effectively “crossed out” despite any font size changes.)
			For each run of <a>considered text</a> with the same 'font-size',
			compute an ideal position averaged from its font metrics.
			To prevent superscripts and subscripts from throwing this position off-kilter,
			an inline with a non-initial computed 'vertical-align'
			is treated as having the ideal underline position of its parent.
			Position the portion of the line across each decorated fragment at that position.

			<p class='issue'>
				For simplicity, line-throughs should draw over each element at that element's preferred/averaged position.
				This can produce some undesirable jumpiness,
				but there doesn't appear to be any way to avoid that which is correct in all instances,
				and all attempts are worryingly complex.
				What position should line-throughts adopt over elements that have a different font-size,
				but no <a>considered text</a>?
	</dl>

	<p>
		CSS does not define the thickness of line decorations.
		In determining the thickness of text decoration lines,
		user agents may consider the font sizes, faces, and weights of descendants
		to provide an appropriately averaged thickness.

	<div class="example">
		<p>The following figure shows the averaging for underline:
		<p><img alt="In the first rendering of the underlined text '1st a'
								 with 'st' as a superscript, both the '1st' and the 'a'
								 are rendered in a small font. In the second rendering,
								 the 'a' is rendered in a larger font. In the third, both
								 '1st' and 'a' are large."
						height="105" src="images/underline-averaging.gif" width="326">
		<p>In the three fragments of underlined text, the underline is drawn
			consecutively lower and thicker as the ratio of large text to small
			text increases.</p>
		<p>Using the same example, a line-through would in the second fragment,
		instead of averaging the two font sizes,
		split the line-through into two segments:
		<p><img alt="" src="images/linethrough-averaging.gif">
		<p>In both cases, however, the superscript, due to the vertical-alignment shift,
		has no effect on the position of the line.
	</div>

<h3 id="underline-offset">
Text Underline Offset: the 'text-underline-offset' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-underline-offset
	Value: auto | from-font | <<length>>
	Initial: auto
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: specified keyword or absolute length
	Animation type: by computed value
	</pre>

	This property, which is <em>not</em> a <a>sub-property</a> of the 'text-decoration' shorthand,
	sets the offset of underlines from their initial position.

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-for=text-underline-offset dfn-type=value>
		<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			The UA chooses an appropriate offset for underlines.

		<dt><dfn>from-font</dfn>
		<dd>
			If the <a>first available font</a> has
			metrics indicating a preferred underline offset,
			use that offset,
			otherwise behaves as ''text-underline-offset/auto''.

		<dt><dfn><<length>>
		<dd>
			Specifies the offset of underlines as a length.
			This replaces any information in the font
			or derived from glyph shapes / character ranges.
			Authors are strongly encouraged to use ''em'' units
			so that the offset scales with the font.
	</dl>

	The initial position of the underline depends on the value of 'text-underline-position'
	as detailed below.

	<table class="data">
		<caption>Interaction of 'text-underline-position' and 'text-underline-offset'
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>'text-underline-position'
				<th>Initial Position
				<th>Positive Direction
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>''text-underline-position/auto''
				<td>alphabetic baseline
				<td><a>over</a>
			<tr>
				<td>''text-underline-position/under''
				<td>text-under edge
				<td><a>over</a>
			<tr>
				<td>''text-underline-position/over''
				<td>text-over edge
				<td><a>under</a>
	</table>

	<ul>
		<li>The line is aligned to the outside of the specified position.
		    (Below for ''text-underline-position/under''/''text-underline-position/auto'' positions,
		    above for ''text-underline-position/over''.)
		<li>Positive lengths represent inward distances; negative lengths outward.
		<li>Automatic adjustments made to accommodate descendant content are maintained;
			the 'text-underline-offset' is in addition to those.
			<span class="issue">Should this be removed?</span>
	</ul>

	When the value of the 'text-decoration-line' property is either
	''spelling-error'' or ''grammar-error'',
	the UA may ignore the value of 'text-underline-position'.

<h3 id="text-decoration-skipping">
Text Decoration Line Continuity</h3>

<h4 id="text-decoration-skip-property">
Text Decoration Line Continuity: the 'text-decoration-skip' property</h4>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-decoration-skip
	Value: none | [ objects || [ spaces | [ leading-spaces || trailing-spaces ] ] || edges || box-decoration ]
	Initial: objects leading-spaces trailing-spaces
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: specified keyword(s)
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	Issue: The initial value is quite verbose,
	which makes it inconvenient to set the property
	to the initial value plus something else.
	We should make this easier to specify.

	Issue: This property will be split into individual properties
	along the lines of 'text-decoration-skip-ink',
	to improve its cascading behavior.
	See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/843">discussion</a>
	and <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2017Feb/0049.html">resolution</a>.

	This property specifies what parts of the element's content
	any text decoration affecting the element must skip over. It
	controls all text decoration lines drawn by the element
	and also any text decoration lines drawn by its ancestors.
	Values have the following meanings:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-skip">none</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Skip nothing: text-decoration is drawn for all text content
			and across atomic inline-level boxes.</dd>

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-skip">objects</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Skip this element (its entire margin box) if it is an atomic inline
			(such as an image or inline-block).

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-skip">spaces</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Skip all spacing, i.e. all <a>typographic character units</a> with the Unicode White_Space property [[UAX44]],
			plus any adjacent 'letter-spacing' or 'word-spacing'.

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-skip">edges</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			The UA should place the start and end of the line inwards slightly
			(e.g. by half a line thickness)
			from the content edge of the <a>decorating box</a> so that,
			e.g. two underlined elements side-by-side do not appear to have a single underline.
			(This is important in Chinese, where underlining is a form of punctuation.)

			<div class="figure">
				<p><img title="text-decoration-skip: edges"
						alt="An underline below a series of Chinese characters has a gap between two adjacent underlining elements."
						src="images/decoration-skip-edges.png"
						>
				<p class="caption">''text-decoration-skip: edges'' for <code>&lt;u>石井&lt;/u>&lt;u>艾俐俐&lt;/u></code>
</p>
			</div>

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-skip">box-decoration</dfn>
		<dd>
			Skip over the box's margin, border, and padding areas.
			Note that this only has an effect on decorations imposed by an ancestor;
			a <a>decorating box</a> never draws over its own box decoration.

		<dt><dfn>leading-spaces</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Skip all spacing,
			i.e. all <a>typographic character units</a> with the Unicode White_Space property [[UAX44]]
			and all <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#word-separator">word separators</a>
			plus any adjacent 'letter-spacing' or 'word-spacing',
			when located at the start of the line.

		<dt><dfn>trailing-spaces</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			Skip all spacing,
			i.e. all <a>typographic character units</a> with the Unicode White_Space property [[UAX44]]
			and all <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#word-separator">word separators</a>
			plus any adjacent 'letter-spacing' or 'word-spacing',
			when located at the end of the line.
	</dl>

	<p class="note">Note that this property inherits and that descendant
		elements can have a different setting.</p>

    The following addition is made to the default UA stylesheet for HTML:
	<pre><code class="lang-css">
		ins, del { text-decoration-skip: none; }
	</code></pre>

	When the value of the 'text-decoration-line' property is either
	''spelling-error'' or ''grammar-error'',
	the UA may ignore the value of 'text-decoration-skip'.

<h4 id="text-decoration-skip-ink-property">
Text Decoration Line Continuity: the 'text-decoration-skip-ink' property</h4>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-decoration-skip-ink
	Value: auto | none
	Initial: ''auto''
	Applies to: all elements
	Inherited: yes
	Percentages: N/A
	Computed value: specified keyword
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	This property controls how overlines and underlines are drawn
	when they cross over a glyph.

	When enabled, decoration lines skip over where glyphs are drawn:
	interrupt the decoration line to let the shape of the text show through
	where the text decoration would otherwise cross over a glyph.
	The UA must also skip a small distance to either side of the glyph outline.

	<div class="figure">
		<p><img title="text-decoration-skip: ink"
				alt="An alphabetic underline through Myanmar text skips around descenders and the vertical strokes of combining characters that drop below the alphabetic baseline."
				src="images/decoration-skip-ink.png"
				>
		<p class="caption">''text-decoration-skip: ink''</p>
	</div>

	<div class="issue">
		Ideographic scripts do not want to skip when ''text-decoration-skip-ink/auto''.
		How can we define this behavior?
		Are there more scripts wanting not to skip?
		Need some normative text describe how ''text-decoration-skip-ink/auto'' works.
		See
		<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2017Feb/0069.html">telcon minutes</a>,

		<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1288">csswg#1288</a>
	</div>

	This property only applies to overlines and underlines;
	line-throughs are unaffected.

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-skip-ink">auto</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			UA should skip over where glyphs are drawn.

		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-skip-ink">none</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			UA must draw contiguous lines without interruptions,
			even when they cross over a glyph.

	</dl>

<h2 id="text-shadow-property">
Additional Controls for Text Shadows</h2>

	Level 4 adds a spread radius argument to 'text-shadow',
	using the same syntax and interpretation as for 'box-shadow',
	except that corners are always rounded
	(since the geometry of a glyph is not so simple as a box).

<h2 id="emphasis-marks">
Additional Controls for Emphasis Marks</h2>

	Issue: See also <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1892">issue about continuity in size/position</a>.

<h3 id="text-emphasis-skip">
Emphasis Mark Skip: the 'text-emphasis-skip' property</h3>

	<p class="issue">This section is under brainstorming.
	It's also not yet clear if this property is needed quite yet, despite differences in desired behavior among publications.

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-emphasis-skip

	Initial: spaces punctuation
	Applies to: all elements

	This property describes for which characters marks are drawn.
	The values have following meanings:

	<dl for=text-emphasis-skip type=value>
		<dt><dfn>spaces</dfn>
		<dd>
			Skip <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text/#word-separator">word separators</a> or other <a>characters</a>

<!--

Some notes from Koji :

	Here's what Kobayashi-sensei and I've got.

	We have categorized to:
	1. Controls
	2. Spaces
	3. Connectors
	4. Symbols
	5. Delimiters

	>From these groups, his recommendation is not to put emphasis marks to any of these by default, including symbols.

	1 is C* except Co as we discussed, and 2 is Z*. These are easy.

	3: Connectors are Pc and Pd, plus U+30FB KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT. They are used to "connect", rather than "delimit".

	4: Symbols include more than we have in the spec; #, &, %, @, $, ...

	5: Delimiters are comma, full-stops, parenthesis, etc.; they're used to "delimit".

	Category Po is tough one, as I expected (and you might as well I guess :). By looking at his examples, it has 3, 4, and 5, all mixed.

	Here're options I came up:

	OPTION 1: Categorize every code point of Po (there are 402) into 3, 4, and 5, and list them up in the spec.
	OPTION 2: UAX #29 Text Segmentation: Sentence=Close|ATerm|SContinue|STerm are 5, in addition to Ps, Pe, Pi, Pf, and other Po are 4.
	OPTION 3: More simplified; just make all Po as 4: Symbols. It includes full-stops for instance which is not ideal, but simple. Either way, default is ok (if we make symbols to skip by default as Kobayashi-sensei suggested.)

	My preference is OPTION 2, I'm ok with 3. I don't like 1. What do you think?

	U+30FB still cannot be handled, so we could make it as the only exception, but I think just ignoring it is also acceptable (authors still can specify "keep-symbol" to put emphasis marks on them.)

	Three more things I'd like to have your opinions:
	1. Name of value for "connectors": connectors, dashes, hyphens?
	2. What do you think to skip-narrow by default? I have no idea how common emphasis marks for Tibetan is, but his definition includes skip-narrow.
	3. If we take Kobayashi-sensei's list, skip-symbols is also default, so most values other than skip-narrow is "keep-*". Maybe we should change property name?

	I'm copying all Sentence=Close|ATerm|SContinue|STerm for your reference, but you can play with the spreadsheet either on Windows Live or Google docs if you'd like:
