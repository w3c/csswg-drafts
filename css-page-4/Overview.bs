<pre class=metadata>Title: Proposals for the future of CSS Paged MediaShortname: css-pageLevel: 4Group: csswgStatus: UDWork Status: exploringED: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-4/Editor: Daniel Glazman, Disruptive InnovationsAbstract: A list of issues with the current CSS page model, and possibly directions to explore for fixing it.</pre><h2 id=css-page-model>The CSS 3 Page Model</h2>This section is informative.The current Page Model,as described in <cite>CSS3 Module: Paged Media </cite>[[!CSS3PAGE]],is the following one:the printable area of a page,the <dfn id="page-box">page box</dfn>,is made of one page box itself divided in four areas:<figure>	<img alt="CSS 3 Paged Media's page model" src="PageBox.png">	<figcaption>The CSS3 Page Model</figcaption></figure>1. the <dfn id="page-margin">page margin</dfn>;	that area is itself divided into 16 <dfn id="page-margin-boxes">page-margin boxes</dfn>	(@top-left-corner, @top-left, @top-center, etc. )	<figure>		<img alt="CSS 3 page-margin boxes" src="RightMarginBoxes.png">		<figcaption>The 16 page-margin boxes<br>			(with highlight of 3 of them)<br>		</figcaption>	</figure>2. the <dfn id="page-border">page border</dfn>3. the <dfn id="page-padding">page padding</dfn>4. and finally the <dfn id="page-area">page area</dfn>	containing the boxes generated by	the flow of the main contents of the document.It's is possible to flow content,for instance page headers and footers or footnotes,into a page-margin boxusing features introduced by the<cite>CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module </cite>[[!CSS3GCPM]].It is also possible to define multiple page templates for a single documentusing the <span class="css">@page</span> at-rulethat allows to select thefirst page, left pages, right pages or named pages of a paginated flow.If this page model allowed the publishing industry to adopt HTML and CSS as pivot formats,it starts showing its limits for the following reasons:* the 16 page-margin boxes are an extension	of the print features offered by desktop browsers.	Desktop browsers usually offer control over 6 page-margin boxes only.	Only one desktop browser claims implementation	of the page model described above in the fourteen last years.	The other desktop browsers' control over the 6 page-margin boxes	is then not achieved through the cascade of CSS UA stylesheets.* no editing environment available on the market	and in particular Wysiwyg text editor	(for instance like Microsoft Word)	implements such a box model.* it's not possible with the current model to position headers and footers	(for instance the HTML5 header and footer elements)	arbitrarily in the page area.* the ''@page'' at-rule currently allows nested at-rules	only for the definition of page-margin boxes.	Similarly, the set of CSS properties applicable to a page box	is limited and it is impossible in this model to use	<cite>CSS Regions Module Level 3</cite> [[!CSS3-REGIONS]]	to flow content into a given predefined area of a page,	exclude an area from the page using	<cite>CSS 3 Exclusions and Shapes Module</cite> [[!CSS3-EXCLUSIONS]],	lay out the page area into a grid using	<cite>CSS Grid Layout</cite> [[!CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]]	or using <css>''@slot</css> rules	that were discussed multiple times by the CSS Working Group	in the recent past.	The successful electronic book editing environment of Apple Inc.,	iBooks Author,	already allows ''@page'' rules to specify	arbitrary slots,	arbitrary exclusions and shapes,	and extends the list of applicable properties;	most of its advanced layout capabilities are based on these features.* the ''@page'' rule of <cite>CSS 2.1</cite> [[!CSS21]]	is intended for use on print media,	not dynamic media.	The spread of complex HTML-based slideshows and electronic book viewers	has shown that the Page Model should also apply to screen media and alike.* ++TBD
