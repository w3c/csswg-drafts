Introduction</h2>

	This specification extends [[!CSS-OVERFLOW-4]].

	: [[#scroll-marker-group|Scroll marker groups]]
	::
		This section defines pseudo-elements for automatically constructed [[#scroll-navigation|scroll navigation controls]].

	: [[#fragmentation|Redirection of Overflow]]
	::
		This section defines a highly experimental, exploratory new model
		for handling overflow by redirecting it into newly-generated [=fragmentation containers=].

	: [[#scroll-navigation|Scroll navigation controls]]
	::
		This section defines stylable scroll navigation controls
		with defined user interactions and accessible labels.


Note: At the time of writing, [[CSS-OVERFLOW-4]] is not completely finalized yet.
To avoid accidental divergences and maintenance overhead,
This specification is written as a delta specification over css-overflow Level 4.
Once the level 4 specification is final,
its content will be integrated into this specification,
which will then replace it.
Until then, this specification only contains additions and extensions to level 4.

<h2 id="scroll-marker-group">
Overflow Controls: the 'scroll-marker-group' property and pseudo-elements</h2>

	<pre class=propdef>
	Name: scroll-marker-group
	Value: none | before | after
	Initial: none
	Applies to: [=scroll containers=]
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: specified value
	Animation Type: discrete
	Canonical Order: per grammar
	</pre>

	The 'scroll-marker-group' property specifies whether the [=scroll container=] should have a '::scroll-marker-group' pseudo-element created,
	and its position relative to the scroll container.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=scroll-marker-group>
		<dt><dfn>none</dfn>
		<dd>
			The [=scroll container=] does not create a '::scroll-marker-group' pseudo-element.

		<dt><dfn>before</dfn>
		<dd>
			The [=scroll container=] generates a ''::scroll-marker-group'' pseudo-element
			whose box is an immediate preceding sibling to its [=originating element=].

		<dt><dfn>after</dfn>
		<dd>
			The [=scroll container=] generates a ''::scroll-marker-group'' pseudo-element
			whose box is an immediate following sibling to its [=originating element=].

	</dl>

<h3 id="scroll-marker-group-pseudo">The ''::scroll-marker-group'' pseudo-element</h3>

	The <dfn selector>::scroll-marker-group</dfn> pseudo-element box
	is generated by a [=scroll container=] element
	having a computed 'scroll-marker-group' property that is not 'none',
	representing a stylable sibling pseudo-element immediately adjacent to the [=scroll container=].

	The following additions are recommended for the default UA stylesheet
	to ensure that the generation of scroll marker pseudo-elements does not invalidate the layout of the site:

	<pre class="lang-css">
		/* The generation of ::scroll-marker pseudo-elements cannot invalidate layout outside of this pseudo-element. */
		::scroll-marker-group { contain: size !important; }
	</pre>

	The 'scroll-marker-group' implicitly behaves as a single focusable component,
	establishing a <a href="https://open-ui.org/components/focusgroup.explainer/">focusgroup</a>.

<h3 id="scroll-marker-pseudo">The ''::scroll-marker'' pseudo-element</h3>

	When the computed 'content' value of a <dfn selector>::scroll-marker</dfn> pseudo-element is not 'none'
	and its nearest ancestor [=scroll container=] [=scroll container=] has a computed 'scroll-marker-group' property that is not 'none',
	the pseudo-element generates a box attached as a child of the ''::scroll-marker-group'' pseudo-element's generated box
	on its nearest ancestor [=scroll container=].
	These boxes are added in the [=tree order=] of their <a>originating element</a>.

	These pseudo-elements have their {{HTMLLinkElement/scrollTargetElement}} set to their <a>originating element</a>.
	They have a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#attr-tabindex"><code>tabindex</code></a> of '-1',
	making them focusable within their '::scroll-marker-group' either by arrow key navigation within the group,
	or via the tab key when currently active or when no other ''::scroll-marker'' is active and this is the first marker in the group,
	ensuring the group has a <a href="https://open-ui.org/components/focusgroup.explainer/#guaranteed-tab-stop">guaranteed tab stop</a>.

<h2 id="fragmentation" class=no-num>
Appendix A: Redirection of Overflow</h2>

	<!-- Abstract: This module contains the features of CSS relating to new mechanisms of overflow handling in visual media (e.g., screen or paper).  In interactive media, it describes features that allow the overflow from a fixed size container to be handled by pagination (displaying one page at a time).  It also describes features, applying to all visual media, that allow the contents of an element to be spread across multiple fragments, allowing the contents to flow across multiple regions or to have different styles for different fragments. -->

	ISSUE: This section is highly experimental.
	It documents current attempts
	at extending the capabilities of the 'continue' property
	to solve additional use cases.
	However, it does not currently have consensus.
	It is presented here to encourage discussion,
	but non-experimental implementation is not recommended.

	<p>
		In CSS Level 1 [[CSS1]], placing more content than would fit
		inside an element with a specified size
		was generally an authoring error.
		Doing so caused the content to extend
		outside the bounds of the element,
		which would likely cause
		that content to overlap with other elements.
	</p>

	<p>
		CSS Level 2 [[CSS2]] introduced the 'overflow' property,
		which allows authors to have overflow be handled by scrolling,
		which means it is no longer an authoring error.
		It also allows authors to specify
		that overflow is handled by clipping,
		which makes sense when the author's intent
		is that the content not be shown.
		This was further refined in the CSS Overflow Module Level 3 [[CSS-OVERFLOW-3]].
	</p>

	<p>
		However, scrolling is not the only way
		to present large amounts of content,
		and may even not be the optimal way.
		After all, the codex replaced the scroll
		as the common format for large written works
		because of its advantages.
	</p>

	<p>
		This specification introduces
		a mechanism for Web pages to specify
		that an element of a page should handle overflow
		through pagination rather than through scrolling.
	</p>

	<p>
		This specification also extends the concept of overflow
		in another direction.
		Instead of requiring that authors specify a single area
		into which the content of an element must flow,
		this specification allows authors to specify multiple fragments,
		each with their own dimensions and styles,
		so that the content of the element can flow from one to the next,
		using as many as needed to place the content without overflowing.
	</p>

	<p>
		In both of these cases, implementations must
		break the content in the block-progression dimension.
		Implementations must do this is described
		in the CSS Fragmentation Module [[!CSS-BREAK-3]].
	</p>

<h3 id="channelling-overflow">
Channeling Overflow: the 'continue' property</h3>

The 'continue' property gives authors the ability
to request that content that does not fit inside an element
be fragmented (in the sense of [[!CSS-BREAK-3]]),
and provides alternatives
for where the remaining content should continue.

Notably, this property explains traditional pagination,
and extends it further.

	<pre class="propdef partial">
		Name: continue
		New Values: overflow | paginate | fragments
		Initial: auto
		Applies to: block containers [[!CSS2]], flex containers [[!CSS3-FLEXBOX]], and grid containers [[!CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]]
		Inherited: no
		Percentages: N/A
		Computed value: see below
		Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

Issue: The naming of this property and its values is preliminary.
This was initially proposed as
"fragmentation: auto | none | break | clone | page"
in <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0357.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0357.html</a>,
and there is not yet wide agreement as to which naming is better.

Issue: This property is meant to generalize and replace 'region-fragment'.
Once it is sufficiently stable in this specification,
'region-fragment' should be removed from the regions specification in favor of this.

Note: ''continue: fragments'' replaces "overflow:fragments"
from earlier versions of this specification,
while ''continue: paginate'' replaces "overflow: paged-x | paged-y | paged-x-controls | paged-y-controls"

	<dl dfn-for="continue" dfn-type="value">
		<dt>auto
		<dd>''continue/auto'' may only occur as a computed value
		if the element is a <a spec="css-regions">CSS Region</a>
		other than the last one in a <a spec="css-regions">region chain</a>.
		Content that doesn't fit is pushed to the next region of the chain.

		In all other cases, ''continue/auto'' computes to one of the other values.

		Issue: this is different from the definition in [[css-overflow-4#continue]],
		where the specified value is the computed value.
		Which is model better?

		<dt><dfn>overflow</dfn>
		<dd>Content that doesn't fit overflows, according to the 'overflow' property

		<dt><dfn>paginate</dfn>
		<dd>Content that doesn't fit paginates.
		This creates a paginated view inside the element
		similar to the way that 'overflow: scroll' creates a scrollable view.

		See <a href="#paginated-overflow">paginated overflow</a>

		Note: Print is effectively "continue: paginate" on the root.
		<dt><dfn>fragments</dfn>
		<dd>content that doesn't fit causes the element to copy itself and continue laying out.

		See <a href="#fragment-overflow">fragment overflow</a>.
	</dl>

The computed value of the 'continue' for a given element or pseudo element is determined as follow:
<ol>
	<li>On elements or pseudo elements with <a>layout containment</a> (see [[!CSS-CONTAIN-1]]),
	if the specified value is ''continue/auto'' or ''continue/fragments''
	then the computed value is ''continue/overflow''.
	<li>Otherwise, if the specified value is ''continue/auto''
	<ol>
		<li>On a <a spec="css-regions">CSS Region</a> other than the last one in a <a spec="css-regions">region chain</a>,
		the computed value is ''continue/auto''
		<li>On a page
		the computed value is ''continue/paginate''
		<li>On a <a>fragment box</a>
		the computed value is ''continue/fragments''
		<li>Otherwise, the computed value is ''continue/overflow''
	</ol>
	<li>Otherwise, if the specified value is ''continue/fragments''
	<ol>
		<li>On a page
		the computed value is ''continue/paginate''
		<li>Otherwise, the computed value is the specified value
	</ol>
	<li>In all other cases, the computed value is the specified value
</ol>

Issue: If we introduce a pseudo element that can select columns in a multicol,
we would need to specify that auto computes to auto on it,
or introduce a new value and have auto compute to that
(but what would that value compute to on things that aren't columns?).

Note: For background discussions leading to this property, see these threads:
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012May/1197.html">discussion of overflow, overflow-x, overflow-y and overflow-style</a> and
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0357.html">proposal for a fragmentation property</a>

<h3 id="paginated-overflow">
Paginated overflow</h3>

This section introduces and defines the meaning of the ''continue/paginate'' value of the 'continue' property.

Issue: Write this section

Issue: Pages should be possible to style with @page rules. How does that work for nested pages?

<div class="issue">
Should traditional pagination (e.g. when printing)
be expressed through some magic in the computed value of ''continue/auto'',
or by inserting this in the UA stylesheet:
<pre><code class="lang-css">
@media (overflow-block: paged), (overflow-block: optional-paged) {
	:root {
		continue: paginate;
	}
}
</code></pre>
</div>

Issue: Traditional pagination (e.g. when printing) assumes that
:root is contained in the page box,
rather than having the page box be a pseudo element child of :root.
Can we work around that using something similar to fragment boxes?
Or maybe by having a fragment box (reproducing :root) inside a page box inside :root?

Issue: How does the page box model work when it is a child of a regular css box?

Issue: The initial proposal in [[CSS3GCPM]] and implementation from Opera
used 4 values instead of ''continue/paginate'':
"paged-x | paged-y | paged-x-controls | paged-y-controls".
Should this property also include these values,
or are they better handled as separate properties?
(e.g.: "pagination-layout: auto | horizontal | vertical", "pagination-controls: auto | none")

Issue: Ability to display N pages at once
rather than just one page at once?
Could this be a value of "pagination-layout", such as:
"pagination-layout: horizontal 2;"

Issue: Brad Kemper has proposed a model for combining pagination and
fragment overflow, which also deals with displaying multiple pages.
<a href="http://www.w3.org/mid/FF1704C5-D5C1-4D6F-A99D-0DD094036685@gmail.com">http://www.w3.org/mid/FF1704C5-D5C1-4D6F-A99D-0DD094036685@gmail.com</a>

	<p class="issue">
		The current implementation of paginated overflow uses
		the overflow/overflow-x/overflow-y properties
		rather than the overflow-style property as proposed
		in the [[CSS3GCPM]] draft
		(which also matches the [[CSS3-MARQUEE]] proposal).
		or the 'continue' property as described here.
	</p>

<h3 id="fragment-overflow">
Fragmented Overflow</h2>

This section introduces and defines the meaning of
the ''continue/fragments'' value of the 'continue' property.

	<p>
		When the computed value of 'continue' for an element is ''continue/fragments'',
		and implementations would otherwise have created a box for the element,
		then implementations must create a sequence of <dfn>fragment box</dfn>es
		for that element.
		(It is possible for an element with ''continue: fragments''
		to generate only one <a>fragment box</a>.
		However, if an element's computed 'continue' is not ''continue/fragments'',
		then its box is not a <a>fragment box</a>.)
		Every <a>fragment box</a> is a fragmentation container,
		and any overflow
		that would cause that fragmentation container to fragment
		causes another <a>fragment box</a> created as a next sibling
		of the previous one.
		<span class="issue">Or is it as though it's a next sibling of
		the element?  Need to figure out exactly how this interacts with
		other box-level fixup.</span>
		Additionally, if the <a>fragment box</a> is also
		a multi-column box (as defined in [[!css-multicol-1]]
		<span class="issue">though it defines <i>multi-column container</i></span>)
		any content that would lead to the creation of <a>overflow columns</a> [[!css-multicol-1]]
		instead is flown into an additional fragment box.
		However, fragment boxes may themselves be broken
		(due to fragmentation in a fragmentation context outside of them,
		such as pages, columns, or other fragment boxes);
		such breaking leads to fragments of the same fragment box
		rather than multiple fragment boxes.
		(This matters because fragment boxes may be styled by their index;
		such breaking leads to multiple fragments of a fragment box
		with a single index.
		This design choice is so that
		breaking a fragment box across pages does not break
		the association of indices to particular pieces of content.)
		<span class="issue">Should a forced break that breaks to
		an outer fragmentation context cause a new fragment of a single
		fragment box or a new fragment box?</span>
		<span class="issue">Should we find a term other than
		<a>fragment box</a> here to make this a little less confusing?</span>
	</p>

	<p class="issue">
		What if we want to be able to style the pieces of an element
		split within another type of fragmentation context?
		These rules prevent ever using ''::nth-fragment()'' for that,
		despite that the name seems the most logical name for such a feature.

		Authors may wish to style the opening lines of an element
		with different styles
		by putting those opening lines in a separate fragment.
		However, since it may be difficult to predict the exact height
		occupied by those lines
		in order to restrict the first fragment to that height,
		it is more convenient to use the 'max-lines' property,
		which forces a fragment to break
		after a specified number of lines.
		This forces a break after the given number of lines
		contained within the element or its descendants,

	<p class="issue">
		This specification needs to say which type of

	<p class="issue">
		This specification needs a processing model

		to change the amount of space available for them,
		such as [[CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]].
		There has already been some work on such a processing model
		in [[CSS-REGIONS-1]],
		and the work done on a model there,
		and the editors of that specification,
		should inform what happens in this specification.

<h3 id="fragment-styling">Fragment styling</h3>

<h4 id="fragment-pseudo-element">The ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element</h4>

	<p>
		The <dfn selector>::nth-fragment()</dfn> pseudo-element
		is a pseudo-element
		that describes some of the <a>fragment box</a>es generated by an element.
		The argument to the pseudo-element takes the same syntax
		as the argument to the :nth-child() pseudo-class
		defined in [[!SELECT]], and has the same meaning
		except that the number is relative to
		<a>fragment box</a>es generated by the element
		instead of siblings of the element.
	</p>

	<p class="note">
		Selectors that allow addressing fragments
		by counting from the end rather than the start
		are intentionally not provided.
		Such selectors would interfere with determining
		the number of fragments.
	</p>

	<p class="issue">
		Depending on future discussions,
		this ''::nth-fragment(<var>an+b</var>)'' syntax
		may be replaced with
		the new ''::fragment:nth(<var>an+b</var>)'' syntax.
	</p>

<h4 id="style-of-fragments">Styling of fragments</h4>

	<p class="issue">
		Should this apply to continue:fragments only,
		or also to continue:paginate?
		(If it applies,
		then stricter property restrictions would be needed
		for continue:paginate.)
	</p>

	<p>
		In the absence of rules with ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements,
		the computed style for each <a>fragment box</a>
		is the computed style for the element
		for which the <a>fragment box</a> was created.
		However, the style for a <a>fragment box</a> is also influenced
		by rules whose selector's <a>subject</a> [[!SELECT]]
		has an ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element,
		if the 1-based number of the <a>fragment box</a> matches
		that ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element
		and the selector (excluding the ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element)
		matches the element generating the fragments.
	</p>

	<p>
		When determining the style of the <a>fragment box</a>,
		these rules that match the fragment pseudo-element
		cascade together with the rules that match the element,
		with the fragment pseudo-element adding the specificity
		of a pseudo-class to the specificity calculation.
		<span class="issue">Does this need to be specified in
		the cascading module as well?</span>

	<p>
		Styling an ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element with the 'continue'
		property does take effect;
		if a <a>fragment box</a> has a
		computed value of 'continue' other than ''fragments''
		then that fragment box is the last fragment.
		However, overriding 'continue' on the first fragment
		does not cause the <a>fragment box</a> not to exist;
		whether there are fragment boxes at all is determined by
		the computed value of overflow for the element.
	</p>

	<p>
		Styling an ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element with the 'content'
		property has no effect;
		the computed value of 'content' for the fragment box
		remains the same as the computed value of content for the element.
	</p>

	<p>
		Specifying ''display: none'' for a <a>fragment box</a> causes
		the fragment box with that index not to be generated.
		However, in terms of the indices
		used for matching ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements
		of later fragment boxes,
		it still counts as though it was generated.
		However, since it is not generated, it does not contain any content.
	</p>

	<p>
		Specifying other values of 'display', 'position',
		or 'float' is permitted, but is not allowed to change
		the <a>inner display type</a>.
		(Since 'continue' only
		applies to block containers, flex containers, and grid containers).
		<span class="issue">Need to specify exactly how this works</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		To match the model for other pseudo-elements
		where the pseudo-elements live inside their corresponding element,
		declarations in ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements override
		declarations in rules without the pseudo-element.
		The relative priority within such declarations is determined
		by normal cascading order (see [[!CSS2]]).
	</p>

	<p>
		Styles specified on ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements
		do affect inheritance to content within the <a>fragment box</a>.
		In other words, the content within the <a>fragment box</a> must
		inherit from the fragment box's style (i.e., the pseudo-element style)
		rather than directly from the element.
		This means that elements split between fragment boxes may
		have different styles for different parts of the element.
	</p>

	<p class="issue">
		This inheritance rule allows specifying styles indirectly
		(by using explicit ''inherit'' or using default inheritance
		on properties that don't apply to ''::first-letter'')
		that can't be specified directly
		(based on the rules in the next section).
		This is a problem.
		The restrictions that apply to styling inside fragments
		should also apply to inheritance from fragments.

<h4 id="style-in-fragments">Styling inside fragments</h4>

	<p class="issue">
		Should this apply to continue:fragments only,
		or also to continue:paginate?
	</p>

	<p>
		The ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element
		can also be used to style
		content inside of a <a>fragment box</a>.
		Unlike the ''::first-line'' and ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements,
		the ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element can be applied
		to parts of the selector other than the subject:
		in particular, it can match ancestors of the subject.
		However, the only CSS properties applied
		by rules with such selectors
		are those that apply
		to the ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element.
	</p>

	<p>
		To be more precise,
		when a rule's selector has ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements
		attached to parts of the selector other than the subject,
		the declarations in that rule apply to
		a fragment (or pseudo-element thereof) when:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			the declarations are for properties that apply to the
			''::first-letter'' pseudo-element,
		</li>
		<li>
			the declarations would apply to
			that fragment (or pseudo-element thereof)
			had those ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-elements been removed,
			with a particular association between
			each sequence of simple selectors and the element it matched,
			and
		</li>
		<li>
			for each removed ''::nth-fragment()'' pseudo-element,
			the fragment lives within a <a>fragment box</a>
			of the element associated in that association
			with the selector that the pseudo-element was attached to,
			and whose index matches the pseudo-element.
		</li>

Appendix B: Scroll navigation controls</h2>

[[html#the-a-element]] allows creating navigational links to a particular scroll position within the same page.
However, there is little feedback to the user regarding the current content being viewed, and
the interaction model does not match the expectations of modern accessible UI components.

This specification adds a mechanism for creating scroll navigation controls within groups of <{a}> elements.
A group is created through the <a href="https://open-ui.org/components/focusgroup.explainer/">focusgroup</a> attribute
on an ancestor containing one or more <{a}> elements whose <a spec=html>indicated part</a> is on the current page.
Within each group, the active marker reflects the current scroll position, and can be styled to give the user an indication of which section they are in.

Use cases include a table of contents with links to relevant contents,
markers for scrolling carousel pages,
and scrollable tab panels.

Issue: Add images representing these examples.

<h3 id="scroll-target">{{HTMLLinkElement/scrollTargetElement}} attribute</h3>

	An <{a}> element has its {{HTMLLinkElement/scrollTargetElement}}
	initialized to the result of running the <a spec=html>select the indicated part</a> given the current {{Document}} and the <dfn element-attr for=a>href</dfn> attribute value as the |URL|,
	turning it into a [=scroll marker control=] if the resulting <a spec=html>indicated part</a> is non-null.

	The <dfn attribute for=HTMLLinkElement lt=scrollTargetElement>HTMLLinkElement.scrollTargetElement</dfn> instance property
	gets and sets the element being interacted with by the anchor link and can be used to override the initial value established by the |href| property.

	An <{a}> element or ''::scroll-marker'' pseudo-element with a non-null {{HTMLLinkElement/scrollTargetElement}}
	represents a <dfn export>scroll marker control</dfn> which participates in a <dfn>scroll marker group</dfn>
	defined by the containing ''::scroll-marker-group'' psuedo-element (for ''::scroll-marker'' pseudo-elements)
	or nearest ancestor element establishing a <a href="https://open-ui.org/components/focusgroup.explainer/">focusgroup</a>.
	Exactly one control in a group will have its "checked" state set to true.
	A [=scroll marker control=] with a true "checked" state can be styled by the '':checked'' pseudo-class.

	<div algorithm="scrollTargetElement activation">
		When a [=scroll marker control=] is activated by explicit invocation or arrow key focus:

		1. Let <var>element</var> be the {{HTMLLinkElement/scrollTargetElement}} of the control.
		1. Let <var>block</var> be "<code>start</code>".
		1. Let <var>inline</var> be "<code>start</code>".
		1. <a lt='scroll a target into view'>Scroll the element into view</a> with <var>behavior</var>, <var>block</var>, and <var>inline</var>.
		1. 	: If the activation was triggered by invocation
			::
				1. <a spec=html>Follow the hyperlink</a> updating the URL, however retain focus on the marker element.

				Note: If the user tabs away the focus behavior will ensure they tab into the relevant content.
	</div>

<h4 id="scroll-container-scroll">Scroll tracking</h4>

	A scrolling operation might animate towards a particular position
	(e.g. scrollbar arrow clicks, arrow key presses, "behavior: smooth" programmatic scrolls)
	or might directly track a user’s input
	(e.g. touch scrolling, scrollbar dragging).
	In either case, the user agent chooses an 'eventual scroll position' to which the scroller
	will reach. This ensures that the relevant marker is activated immediately.

	This 'eventual scroll position' is used to determine the active marker within each [=scroll marker group=].
	Since markers themselves may represent just the start of the content (e.g. headers), we consider the active marker to be the first one which we are at or beyond the scroll position of.

	<div algorithm="scroll tracking">
		Whenever a [=scroll container=] is scrolled, or layout changes the scroll position, the user agent must run these steps to determine the active marker:

		1. Let <var>position</var> be the 'eventual scroll position' for the scrolling operation.
		1. For each focusgroup <var>group</var> containing one or more [=scroll marker control=] elements whose {{HTMLLinkElement/scrollTargetElement}} is a descendant of [=scroll container=]:

			1. 	Let <var>markers</var> be all of the [=scroll marker control=] elements which are a part of the [=scroll marker group=] for the [=scroll container=].
			1. 	Let <var>targets</var> be the {{HTMLLinkElement/scrollTargetElement}}s of |markers|, associated with the item of |markers| they came from, and sorted in [=tree order=].
			1. 	For each |target| in |targets|, <a>determine the scroll-into-view position</a> of |target|, storing this as the associated |target position| of |target|.
			1. 	Let |selected target| be the largest-indexed item of |targets|
				whose associated |target position| is equal to or before |position| in both the block and inline axises in the current writing mode direction of the [=scroll container=].

				Issue: When the next marker is closer to being aligned than the previous we should use the next marker, in a manner similar to mandatory snap point selection.

			1. 	: If there is no such item,
				::
					Set the "checked" state of all |markers| in the |group| to false and return.

			1. 	Let |selected marker| be the marker associated with |selected target|.
				If multiple items of |markers| are associated with |selected target|,
				set |selected marker| to be the marker that is earliest in tree order.
			1. 	Set the "checked" state of |selected marker| to true.
			1.	: If the active element was the <a href="https://open-ui.org/components/focusgroup.explainer/#last-focused-memory">last-focused element</a> of the |group|,
					::
						Focus |selected marker|
			1. 	Set the <a href="https://open-ui.org/components/focusgroup.explainer/#last-focused-memory">last-focused element</a> of the |group| to |selected marker|.
			1. 	Set the "checked" state of all other |markers| in the |group| to false.
	</div>

<h4 id="scroll-target-focus">Focus behavior</h4>

	When a [=scroll marker control=] is activated,
	the next tabindex-ordered focus navigation will focus the {{HTMLLinkElement/scrollTargetElement}} if it is focusable,
	otherwise, it will find the next focusable element from this <var>element</var> as though it were focused.
