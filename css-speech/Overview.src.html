    <h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that describes the rendering of markup documents
      (e.g. HTML, XML) on various supports, such as screen, paper, speech, etc. The Speech module
      defines aural CSS properties that enable authors to declaratively control the rendering of
      documents via speech synthesis, and using optional audio cues. Note that this standard was
      developed in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Voice/">Voice Browser
        Activity</a>.</p>

    <p> This document is based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-speech-20110818/"
        >Last Call Working Draft (18 August 2011)</a> and includes changes that reflect the outcome
      of the <a href="http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/css3-speech">disposition of comments</a>. </p>
    <p>Before the specification can progress
      to <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr#cfr"
      >Proposed Recommendation,</a> the <a href="#exit">CR exit
      criteria</a> must be met. The specification will not become
      Proposed Recommendation before 20 September 2012. A test suite
      and an implementation report will be made during the Candidate
      Recommendation period. </p>
    <p id="at-risk">The following features are at-risk and may be dropped at the end of the
      Candidate Recommendation period if there has not been enough interest from implementers:
      'voice-balance', 'voice-duration', 'voice-pitch', 'voice-range', and 'voice-stress'. </p>
    <h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="contents">Table of contents</h2>
    <!--toc-->
    <h2 id="intro">Introduction, design goals</h2>
    <p class="note">Note that this section is informative.</p>
    <p>The aural presentation of information is commonly used by people who are blind,
      visually-impaired or otherwise print-disabled. For instance, "screen readers" allow users to
      interact with visual interfaces that would otherwise be inaccessible to them. There are also
      circumstances in which <em>listening</em> to content (as opposed to <em>reading</em>) is
      preferred, or sometimes even required, irrespective of a person's physical ability to access
      information. For instance: playing an e-book whilst driving a vehicle, learning how to
      manipulate industrial and medical devices, interacting with home entertainment systems,
      teaching young children how to read.</p>
    <p> The CSS properties defined in the Speech module enable authors to declaratively control the
      presentation of a document in the aural dimension. The aural rendering of a document combines
      speech synthesis (also known as "TTS", the acronym for "Text to Speech") and auditory icons
      (which are referred-to as "audio cues" in this specification). The CSS Speech properties
      provide the ability to control speech pitch and rate, sound levels, TTS voices, etc. These
      stylesheet properties can be used together with visual properties (mixed media), or as a
      complete aural alternative to a visual presentation. </p>
    <h2 id="background">Background information, CSS 2.1</h2>
    <p class="note">Note that this section is informative.</p>
    <p> The CSS Speech module is a re-work of the informative CSS2.1 Aural appendix, within which
      the "aural" media type was described, but also deprecated (in favor of the "speech" media
      type). Although the [[!CSS21]] specification reserves the "speech" media type, it doesn't
      actually define the corresponding properties. The Speech module describes the CSS properties
      that apply to the "speech" media type, and defines a new "box" model specifically for the
      aural dimension. </p>
    <p> Content creators can conditionally include CSS properties dedicated to user agents with text
      to speech synthesis capabilities, by specifying the "speech" media type via the
        <code>media</code> attribute of the <code>link</code> element, or with the
        <code>@media</code> at-rule, or within an <code>@import</code> statement. When styles are
      authored within the scope of such conditional statements, they are ignored by user agents that
      do not support the Speech module. </p>
    <h2 id="ssml-rel">Relationship with SSML</h2>
    <p class="note">Note that this section is informative.</p>
    <p>Some of the features in this specification are conceptually similar to functionality
      described in the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.1 [[!SSML]]. However, the
      specificities of the CSS model mean that compatibility with SSML in terms of syntax and/or
      semantics is only partially achievable. The definition of each property in the Speech module
      includes informative statements, wherever necessary, to clarify their relationship with
      similar functionality from SSML.</p>
    <h2 id="css-values">CSS values</h2>
    <p>This specification follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs"
        >CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in this
      specification are defined in CSS Value and Units Level 3 [[!CSS3VAL]]. </p>
    <p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions, all properties
      defined in this specification also accept the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">inherit</a> keyword as
      their property value. For readability it has not been repeated explicitly. </p>
    <h2 id="example">Example</h2>
    <div class="example">
      <p>This example shows how authors can tell the speech synthesizer to speak HTML headings with
        a voice called "paul", using "moderate" emphasis (which is more than normal) and how to
        insert an audio cue (pre-recorded audio clip located at the given URL) before the start of
        TTS rendering for each heading. In a stereo-capable sound system, paragraphs marked with the
        CSS class "heidi" are rendered on the left audio channel (and with a female voice, etc.),
        whilst the class "peter" corresponds to the right channel (and to a male voice, etc.). The
        volume level of text spans marked with the class "special" is lower than normal, and a
        prosodic boundary is created by introducing a strong pause after it is spoken (note how the
          <code>span</code> inherits the voice-family from its parent paragraph).</p>
      <pre>
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
{
  voice-family: paul;
  voice-stress: moderate;
  cue-before: url(../audio/ping.wav);
  voice-volume: medium 6dB;
}
p.heidi
{
  voice-family: female;
  voice-balance: left;
  voice-pitch: high;
  voice-volume: -6dB;
}
p.peter
{
  voice-family: male;
  voice-balance: right;
  voice-rate: fast;
}
span.special
{
  voice-volume: soft;
  pause-after: strong;
}

...

&lt;h1&gt;I am Paul, and I speak headings.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class="heidi"&gt;Hello, I am Heidi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="peter"&gt;
  &lt;span class="special"&gt;Can you hear me ?&lt;/span&gt;
  I am Peter.
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    </div>
    <h2 id="aural-model">The aural formatting model</h2>
    <p>The CSS formatting model for aural media is based on a sequence of sounds and silences that
      occur within a nested context similar to the <a href="#box-model-def">visual box model</a>,
      which we name the <dfn id="aural-box-model">aural "box" model</dfn>. The aural "canvas"
      consists of a two-channel (stereo) space and of a temporal dimension, within which synthetic
      speech and audio cues coexist. The selected element is surrounded by 'rest', 'cue' and 'pause'
      properties (from the innermost to the outermost position). These can be seen as aural
      equivalents to 'padding', 'border' and 'margin', respectively. When used, the ':before' and
      ':after' pseudo-elements [[!CSS21]] get inserted between the element's contents and the
      'rest'. </p>
    <p> The following diagram illustrates the equivalence between properties of the visual and aural
      box models, applied to the selected &lt;element&gt;:</p>
    <p>
      <img
        title="The aural 'box' model, illustrated by a diagram: the selected element is positioned in the center, on its left side are (from innermost to outermost) rest-before, cue-before, pause-before, on its right side are (from innermost to outermost) rest-after, cue-after, pause-after, where rest is conceptually similar to padding, cue is similar to border, pause is similar to margin."

    <p>The 'voice-volume' property allows authors to control the amplitude of the audio waveform
      generated by the speech synthesiser, and is also used to adjust the relative volume level of
        <a href="#cue-props">audio cues</a> within the <a href="#aural-model">aural box model</a> of
      the selected element. </p>
    <p class="note"> Note that although the functionality provided by this property is similar to
      the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/#edef_prosody"><code>volume</code>
        attribute of the <code>prosody</code> element</a> from the SSML markup language [[!SSML]],
      there are notable discrepancies. For example, CSS Speech volume keywords and decibels units
      are not mutually-exclusive, due to how values are inherited and combined for selected
      elements. </p>
    <dl>
      <!-- dt>
        <strong>normal</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p> Corresponds to +0.0dB, which means that there is no modification of volume level. This
          value overrides the inherited value.</p>
      </dd -->
      <dt>
        <strong>silent</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p> Specifies that no sound is generated (the text is read "silently").</p>
        <p class="note"> Note that this has the same effect as using negative infinity decibels.
          Also note that there is a difference between an element whose 'voice-volume' property has
          a value of 'silent', and an element whose 'speak' property has the value 'none'. With the
          former, the selected element takes up the same time as if it was spoken, including any
          pause before and after the element, but no sound is generated (descendants within the <a
            href="#aural-model">aural box model</a> of the selected element can override the
          'voice-volume' value, and may therefore generate audio output). With the latter, the
          selected element is not rendered in the aural dimension and no time is allocated for
          playback (descendants within the <a href="#aural-model">aural box model</a> of the
          selected element can override the 'speak' value, and may therefore generate audio output).

          <strong>loud</strong>, <strong>x-loud</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This sequence of keywords corresponds to monotonically non-decreasing volume levels,
          mapped to implementation-dependent values that meet the listener's requirements with
          regards to perceived loudness. These audio levels are typically provided via a preference
          mechanism that allow users to calibrate sound options according to their auditory
          environment. The keyword 'x-soft' maps to the user's <em>minimum audible</em> volume
          level, 'x-loud' maps to the user's <em>maximum tolerable</em> volume level, 'medium' maps
          to the user's <em>preferred</em> volume level, 'soft' and 'loud' map to intermediary
          values.</p>

      <dd>
        <p>A <a href="#number-def">number</a> immediately followed by "dB" (decibel unit). This
          represents a change (positive or negative) relative to the given keyword value (see
          enumeration above), or to the default value for the root element, or otherwise to the
          inherited volume level (which may itself be a combination of a keyword value and of a
          decibel offset, in which case the decibel values are combined additively). When the
          inherited volume level is 'silent', this 'voice-volume' resolves to 'silent' too,
          regardless of the specified &lt;decibel&gt; value. Decibels represent the ratio of the
          squares of the new signal amplitude (a1) and the current amplitude (a0), as per the
          following logarithmic equation: volume(dB) = 20 log10 (a1 / a0) </p>
        <p class="note"> Note that -6.0dB is approximately half the amplitude of the audio signal,
          and +6.0dB is approximately twice the amplitude.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="note">Note that perceived loudness depends on various factors, such as the listening
      environment, user preferences or physical abilities. The effective volume variation between
      'x-soft' and 'x-loud' represents the dynamic range (in terms of loudness) of the audio output.
      Typically, this range would be compressed in a noisy context, i.e. the perceived loudness
      corresponding to 'x-soft' would effectively be closer to 'x-loud' than it would be in a quiet
      environment. There may also be situations where both 'x-soft' and 'x-loud' would map to low
      volume levels, such as in listening environments requiring discretion (e.g. library,
      night-reading). </p>

    <p> user agents may be connected to different kinds of sound systems, featuring varying audio
      mixing capabilities. The expected behavior for mono, stereo, and surround sound systems is
      defined as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> When user agents produce audio via a mono-aural sound system (i.e. single-speaker setup),
        the 'voice-balance' property has no effect. </li>
      <li> When user agents produce audio through a stereo sound system (e.g. two speakers, a pair
        of headphones), the left-right distribution of audio signals can precisely match the
        authored values for the 'voice-balance' property. </li>
      <li> When user agents are capable of mixing audio signals through more than 2 channels (e.g.
        5-speakers surround sound system, including a dedicated center channel), the physical
        distribution of audio signals resulting from the application of the 'voice-balance' property
        should be performed so that the listener perceives sound as if it was coming from a basic
        stereo layout. For example, the center channel as well as the left/right speakers may be
        used altogether in order to emulate the behavior of the 'center' value. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Future revisions of the CSS Speech module may include support for three-dimensional audio,
      which would effectively enable authors to specify "azimuth" and "elevation" values. In the
      future, content authored using the current specification may therefore be consumed by user
      agents which are compliant with the version of CSS Speech that supports three-dimensional
      audio. In order to prepare for this possibility, the values enabled by the current
      'voice-balance' property are designed to remain compatible with "azimuth" angles. More
      precisely, the mapping between the current left-right audio axis (lateral sound stage) and the
      envisioned 360 degrees plane around the listener's position is defined as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The value '0' maps to zero degrees ('center'). This is in "front" of the listener, not
        from "behind".</li>
      <li>The value '-100' maps to -40 degrees ('left'). Negative angles are in the
        counter-clockwise direction (the audio stage is seen from the top).</li>
      <li>The value '100' maps to 40 degrees ('right'). Positive angles are in the clockwise
        direction (the audio stage is seen from the top).</li>
      <li>Intermediary values on the scale from '-100' to '100' map to the angles between -40 and 40
        degrees in a numerically linearly-proportional manner. For example, '-50' maps to -20
        degrees.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note"> Note that sound systems may be configured by users in such a way that it would
      interfere with the left-right audio distribution specified by document authors. Typically, the
      various "surround" modes available in modern sound systems (including systems based on basic
      stereo speakers) tend to greatly alter the perceived spatial arrangement of audio signals. The
      illusion of a three-dimensional sound stage is often achieved using a combination of phase
      shifting, digital delay, volume control (channel mixing), and other techniques. Some users may
      even configure their system to "downgrade" any rendered sound to a single mono channel, in
      which case the effect of the 'voice-balance' property would obviously not be perceivable at
      all. The rendering fidelity of authored content is therefore dependent on such user
      customizations, and the 'voice-balance' property merely specifies the desired end-result. </p>
    <p class="note"> Note that many speech synthesizers only generate mono sound, and therefore do
      not intrinsically support the 'voice-balance' property. The sound distribution along the
      left-right axis consequently occurs at post-synthesis stage (when the speech-enabled user
      agent mixes the various audio sources authored within the document) </p>

        <p>Spells the text one letter at a time (useful for acronyms and abbreviations). In
          languages where accented characters are rare, it is permitted to drop accents in favor of
          alternative unaccented spellings. As as example, in English, the word "r&ocirc;le" can
          also be written as "role". A conforming implementation would thus be able to spell-out

    <p>The 'pause' property is a shorthand property for 'pause-before' and 'pause-after'. If two
      values are given, the first value is 'pause-before' and the second is 'pause-after'. If only
      one value is given, it applies to both properties.</p>
    <div class="example">

    <p> The pause defines the minimum distance of the aural "box" to the aural "boxes" before and
      after it. Adjoining pauses are merged by selecting the strongest named break and the longest
      absolute time interval. For example, "strong" is selected when comparing "strong" and "weak",
      "1s" is selected when comparing "1s" and "250ms", and "strong" and "250ms" take effect
      additively when comparing "strong" and "250ms". </p>
    <p>The following pauses are adjoining:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The 'pause-after' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-after' of its last child, provided the
        former has no 'rest-after' and no 'cue-after'.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-before' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-before' of its first child, provided
        the former has no 'rest-before' and no 'cue-before'.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-after' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-before' of its next sibling.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-before' and 'pause-after' of an aural "box", if the the "box" has a
        'voice-duration' of "0ms" and no 'rest-before' or 'rest-after' and no 'cue-before' or
        'cue-after', or if the the "box" has no rendered content at all (see 'speak').</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A collapsed pause is considered adjoining to another pause if any of its component pauses is
      adjoining to that pause.</p>
    <p class="note"> Note that 'pause' has been moved from between the element's contents and any
      'cue' to outside the 'cue'. This is not backwards compatible with the informative CSS2.1 Aural
      appendix [[!CSS21]].</p>

    <h3 id="cue-props-volume">Relation between audio cues and speech synthesis volume levels</h3>
    <p class="note">Note that this section is informative.</p>

    <p> The volume levels of audio cues and of speech synthesis within the <a href="#aural-model"
        >aural box model</a> of a selected element are related. For example, the desired effect of
      an audio cue whose volume level is set at +0dB (as specified by the &lt;decibel&gt; value) is
      that its perceived loudness during playback is close to that of the speech synthesis rendition
      of the selected element, as dictated by the computed value of the 'voice-volume' property.
      Note that a 'silent' computed value for the 'voice-volume' property results in audio cues
      being "forcefully" silenced as well (i.e. regardless of the specified audio cue 'decibel'
      value) </p>

    <p> The volume keywords of the 'voice-volume' property are user-calibrated to match requirements
      not known at authoring time (e.g. auditory environment, personal preferences). Therefore, in
      order to achieve this approximate loudness alignment of audio cues and speech synthesis,
      authors should ensure that the volume level of audio cues (on average, as there may be
      discrete variations of perceived loudness due to changes in the audio stream, such as
      intonation, stress, etc.) matches the output of a speech synthesis rendition based on the
      'voice-family' intended for use, given "typical" listening conditions (i.e. default system
      volume levels, centered equalization across the frequency spectrum). As speech processors are
      capable of directly controlling the waveform amplitude of generated text-to-speech audio, and
      because user agents are able to adjust the volume output of audio cues (i.e. amplify or
      attenuate audio signals based on the intrinsic waveform amplitude of digitized sound clips),
      this sets a baseline that enables implementations to manage the loudness of both TTS and cue
      audio streams within the aural box model, relative to user-calibrated volume levels (see the
      keywords defined in the 'voice-volume' property). </p>

    <p> Due to the complex relationship between perceived audio characteristics (e.g. loudness) and
      the processing applied to the digitized audio signal (e.g. signal compression), we refer to a
      simple scenario whereby the attenuation is indicated in decibels, typically ranging from 0dB
      (i.e. maximum audio input, near clipping threshold) to -60dB (i.e. total silence). Given this
      context, a "standard" audio clip would oscillate between these values, the loudest peak levels
      would be close to -3dB (to avoid distortion), and the relevant audible passages would have
      average (RMS) volume levels as high as possible (i.e. not too quiet, to avoid background noise
      during amplification). This would roughly provide an audio experience that could be seamlessly
      combined with text-to-speech output (i.e. there would be no discernible difference in volume
      levels when switching from pre-recorded audio to speech synthesis). Although there exists no
      industry-wide standard to support such convention, different TTS engines tend to generate
      comparably-loud audio signals when no gain or attenuation is specified. For voice and soft
      music, -15dB RMS seems to be pretty standard. </p>

        <p class="note">Note that as a result, most punctuation characters, or digits at the start
          of each token, must be escaped in unquoted voice names. </p>
        <p> If a sequence of identifiers is given as a voice name, the computed value is the name
          converted to a string by joining all the identifiers in the sequence by single spaces. </p>
        <p> Voice names that happen to be the same as the gender keywords ('male', 'female' and
          'neutral') or that happen to match the keywords 'inherit' or 'preserve' must be quoted to
          disambiguate with these keywords. The keywords 'initial' and 'default' are reserved for
          future use and must also be quoted when used as voice names. </p>
        <p class="note"> Note that in [[!SSML]], voice names are space-separated and cannot contain
          whitespace characters.</p>
        <p> It is recommended to quote voice names that contain white space, digits, or punctuation
          characters other than hyphens - even if these voice names are valid in unquoted form - in

          cost of a certain degree of approximation. Future versions of this specification may

    <h4 class="no-toc" id="voice-selection">Voice selection, content language</h4>
    <p>The 'voice-family' property is used to guide the selection of the speech synthesis voice
      instance. As part of this selection process, speech-capable user agents must also take into
      account the language of the selected element within the markup content. The "name", "gender",
      "age", and preferred "variant" (index) are voice selection hints that get carried down the
      content hierarchy as the 'voice-family' property value gets inherited by descendant elements.
      At any point within the content structure, the language takes precedence (i.e. has a higher
      priority) over the specified CSS voice characteristics. </p>
    <p> The following list outlines the voice selection algorithm (note that the definition of
      "language" is loose here, in order to cater for dialectic variations):</p>
    <ol>
      <li> If only a single voice instance is available for the language of the selected content,
        then this voice must be used, regardless of the specified CSS voice characteristics. </li>
      <li> If several voice instances are available for the language of the selected content, then
        the chosen voice is the one that most closely matches the specified name, or gender, age,
        and preferred voice variant. The actual definition of "best match" is processor-dependent.
        For example, in a system that only has male and female adult voices available, a reasonable
        match for "voice-family: young male" may well be a higher-pitched female voice, as this tone
        of voice would be close to that of a young boy. If no voice instance matches the
        characteristics provided by any of the 'voice-family' component values, the first available
        voice instance (amongst those suitable for the language of the selected content) must be
        used. </li>
      <li> If no voice is available for the language of the selected content, it is recommended that
        user agents let the user know about the lack of appropriate TTS voice. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The speech synthesizer voice must be re-evaluated (i.e. the selection process must take place
      once again) whenever any of the CSS voice characteristics change within the content flow. The
      voice must also be re-calculated whenever the content language changes, unless the 'preserve'
      keyword is used (this may be useful in cases where embedded foreign language text can be
      spoken using a voice not designed for this language, as demonstrated by the example
      below).</p>
    <p class="note">Note that dynamically computing a voice may lead to unexpected lag, so user
      agents should try to resolve concrete voice instances in the document tree before the playback
      starts. </p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Examples of property values:</p>
      <pre>
h1 { voice-family: announcer, old male; }
p.romeo  { voice-family: romeo, young male; }
p.juliet { voice-family: juliet, young female; }

    <p> The 'voice-range' property specifies the variability in the "baseline" pitch, i.e. how much
      the fundamental frequency may deviate from the average pitch of the speech output. The dynamic
      pitch range of the generated speech generally increases for a highly animated voice, for
      example when variations in inflection are used to convey meaning and emphasis in speech.
      Typically, a low range produces a flat, monotonic voice, whereas a high range produces an
      animated voice. </p>
    <p class="note"> Note that although the functionality provided by this property is similar to

    <p> The 'voice-duration' property specifies how long it should take to render the selected
      element's content (not including <a href="#cue-props">audio cues</a>, <a href="#pause-props">
        pauses</a> and <a href="#rest-props">rests</a> ). Unless the value 'auto' is specified, this
      property takes precedence over the 'voice-rate' property, and should be used to determine a
      suitable speaking rate for the voice. An element for which the 'voice-duration' property value
      is not 'auto' may have descendants for which the 'voice-duration' and 'voice-rate' properties
      are specified, but these must be ignored. In other words, when a 'time' is specified for the
      'voice-duration' of a selected element, it applies to the entire element subtree (children
      cannot override the property). </p>
    <p class="note"> Note that the functionality provided by this property is similar to the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/#edef_prosody"><code>duration</code> attribute

    <h2 id="lists">List items and counters styles</h2>
    <p>The '<a href="#list-style-type-def">
        <code class="property">list-style-type</code></a>' property of [[!CSS21]] specifies three
      types of list item markers: glyphs, numbering systems, and alphabetic systems. The values
      allowed for this property are also used for the counter() function of the 'content' property.
      The CSS Speech module defines how to render these styles in the aural dimension, using speech
      synthesis. The '<a href="#list-style-image-def"><code class="property"
        >list-style-image</code></a>' property of [[!CSS21]] is ignored, and instead the '<a
        href="#list-style-type-def"><code class="property">list-style-type</code></a>' is used. </p>
    <p class="note"> Note that the speech rendering of new features from the CSS Lists and Counters
      Module Level 3 [[CSS3LIST]] is not covered in this level of CSS Speech, but may be defined in
      a future specification.</p>

        <strong>disc, circle, square</strong>

        <p> For these list item styles, the user agent defines (possibly based on user preferences)
          what equivalent phrase is spoken or what audio cue is played. List items with graphical
          bullets are therefore announced appropriately in an implementation-dependent manner. </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <strong>decimal, decimal-leading-zero, lower-roman, upper-roman, georgian, armenian</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p> For these list item styles, corresponding numbers are spoken as-is by the speech
          synthesizer, and may be complemented with additional audio cues or speech phrases in the
          document's language (i.e. with the same TTS voice used to speak the list item content) in
          order to indicate the presence of list items. For example, when using the English
          language, the list item counter could be prefixed with the word "Item", which would result
          in list items being announced with "Item one", "Item two", etc. </p>

        <p> These list item styles are spelled out letter-by-letter by the speech synthesizer, in
          the document language (i.e. with the same TTS voice used to speak the list item content).
          For example, 'lower-greek' in English would be read out as "alpha", "beta", "gamma", etc.
          Conversely, 'upper-latin' in French would be read out as /a/, /be/, /se/, etc. (phonetic
          notation) </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="note">Note that it is common for user agents such as screen readers to announce the
      nesting depth of list items, or more generally, to indicate additional structural information
      pertaining to complex hierarchical content. The verbosity of these additional audio cues
      and/or speech output can usually be controlled by users, and contribute to increasing
      usability. These navigation aids are implementation-dependent, but it is recommended that user
      agents supporting the CSS Speech module ensure that these additional audio cues and speech
      output don't generate redundancies or create inconsistencies (for example: duplicated or
      different list item numbering scheme). </p>
    <h2 id="content">Inserted and replaced content</h2>
    <p class="note">Note that this entire section is informative.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, authors will want to specify a mapping from the source text into another string
      prior to the application of the regular pronunciation rules. This may be used for uncommon
      abbreviations or acronyms which are unlikely to be recognized by the synthesizer. The
      'content' property can be used to replace one string by another. The functionality provided by
      this property is similar to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/#edef_sub"
          ><code>alias</code> attribute of the <code>sub</code> element</a> from the SSML markup
      language [[!SSML]]. </p>
    <div class="example">
      <p> In this example, the abbreviation is rendered using the content of the title attribute
        instead of the element's content.</p>
      <pre>
/* This replaces the content of the selected element
by the string "World Wide Web Consortium". */
abbr { content: attr(title); }
...

&lt;abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium"&gt;W3C&lt;/abbr&gt;</pre>
    </div>
    <p>In a similar way, text strings in a document can be replaced by a previously recorded
      version.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>In this example - assuming the format is supported, the file is available and the UA is
        configured to do so - a recording of Sir John Gielgud's declamation of the famous monologue
        is played. Otherwise the UA falls back to render the text using synthesized speech. </p>
      <pre>
.hamlet { content: url(./audio/gielgud.wav); }
...

&lt;div class="hamlet"&gt;
To be, or not to be: that is the question:
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Furthermore, authors (or users via a user stylesheet) may add some information to ease the
      understanding of structures during non-visual interaction with the document. They can do so by
      using the '::before' and '::after' pseudo-elements. Note that different stylesheets can be
      used to define the level of verbosity for additional information spoken by screen readers.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>This example inserts the string "Start list: " before a list and the string "List item: "
        before the content of each list item. Likewise, the string "List end: " gets inserted after
        the list to inform the user that the list speech output is over.</p>
      <pre>
ul::before { content: "Start list: "; }
ul::after  { content: "List end. "; }
li::before { content: "List item: "; }</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Detailed information can be found in the CSS3 Generated and Replaced Content module
      [[CSS3GENCON]].</p>
    <h2 id="pronunciation"> Pronunciation, phonemes </h2>
    <p class="note">Note that this entire section is informative.</p>
    <p> CSS does not specify how to define the pronunciation (expressed using a well-defined
      phonetic alphabet) of a particular piece of text within the markup document. A "phonemes"
      property was described in earlier drafts of this specification, but objections were raised due
      to breaking the principle of separation between content and presentation (the "phonemes"
      authored within aural CSS stylesheets would have needed to be updated each time text changed
      within the markup document). The "phonemes" functionality is therefore considered out-of-scope
      in CSS (the presentation layer) and should be addressed in the markup / content layer.</p>
    <p> The <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-pronunciation">"pronunciation"</a>
      <code>rel</code> value allows importing pronunciation lexicons in HTML documents using the
        <code>link</code> element (similar to how CSS stylesheets can be included). The W3C PLS
      (Pronunciation Lexicon Specification) [[PRONUNCIATION-LEXICON]] is one format that can be used
      to describe such a lexicon.</p>
    <p> Additionally, an attribute-based mechanism can be used within the markup to author
      text-pronunciation associations. At the time of writing, such mechanism isn't formally defined
      in the W3C HTML standard(s). However, the <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/30">EPUB 3.0
        specification</a> allows (x)HTML5 documents to contain attributes derived from the [[!SSML]]
      specification, that describe how to pronounce text based on a particular phonetic
      alphabet.</p>
    <!-- p> 
      One avenue to explore is the use CSS to "bind" HTML text with a   
      phoneme (also declared in the HTML document). This would maintain a   
      clear separation between content and presentation, and it would allow   
      authors to define different pronunciations for one given text token   
      (Media Queries could drive the switch of stylesheet to import). This   
      possibility has been mentioned several times by Working Group members   
      as well as people from the public mailing-list, so it cannot be   
      ignored. However, there are architectural considerations (e.g.   
      collision between CSS versus HTML -defined phonemes) which make this a   
      lot trickier to standardize than it sounds. The   
      whole "speech synthesis" issue should be tackled globally at the level   
      of the W3C ecosystem. For example, there are many cross-cutting   
      concerns with the work done by the HTML-Audio and HTML-Speech   
      Incubator Groups.

      CSS3 Speech module by parsing them correctly and rendering the document accordingly. However
      the inability of a UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device does not
      make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not required to render color on a monochrome

	<p>This document was updated to address the issues listed in the Last Call Working Draft (18 August 2011) <a href="http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/css3-speech">Disposition Of Comments</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarified the relationship between SSML and CSS3-Speech, across the specification (exact 1-to-1 mapping, or similarity).</li>
      <li>Minor editorial improvement to clarify the use of 'voice-rate' percentages.</li>
      <li>Changed 'span' to 'em' to illustrate the use of 'voice-stress'.</li>
      <li>Added accessible description for the aural box model diagram.</li>
      <li>Fixed the informative statements about volume level of audio cues.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- For reference only, changes in previous draft
      (http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-speech-20110818/#changes) -->
    <!-- ul>
      <li>Renamed 'voice-pitch-range' to 'voice-range', which is compatible with SSML's notation,
        and removes the possibility to interpret this property as being a subset of
        'voice-pitch'.</li>
      <li>Fixed "computed value" for 'voice-pitch' and 'voice-range' properties, and added the
        possibility to combine a keyword with a relative change.</li>
      <li>Removed the "phonemes" property (and its associated "@alphabet" at-rule).</li>
      <li>Renamed 'speakability' to 'speak', and 'speak' to 'speak-as'. Reorganized the 'speak-as'
        values to allow mixing different types.</li>
      <li>Added support for lists and counters (item styles, numbering, etc.).</li>
      <li>Adjusted the [initial] value for shorthand properties, to be consistent with other CSS
        specifications (i.e. "see individual properties"), and removed the erroneous "inherit"
        value.</li>
      <li>Fixed 'voice-volume' by conforming to SSML 1.1 (dB scale, etc.).</li>
      <li>Fixed the [initial] values for 'pause' and 'rest', which should be zero (were
        "implementation-dependent").</li>
      <li>Corrected the [initial] values for 'voice-range' and 'voice-pitch' to "medium".</li>
      <li>Added an "auto" value to 'voice-duration', which is the [initial] property value as
        well.</li>
      <li>Handling of 'voice-balance' values outside of the allowed range (clamping).</li>
      <li>Fixed 'voice-balance' prose to better explain the relationship between author intent
        (stereo sound distribution) and actual user sound system setup (mono, stereo, or surround
        speaker layout / mixing capabilities).</li>
      <li>Added prose for 'voice-balance' to describe the mapping between stereo left-right sound
        axis and three-dimensional sound stage (azimuth support in future versions of
        CSS-Speech).</li>
      <li>Fixed the "computed value" for 'voice-balance'.</li>
      <li>Added the 'normal' value for voice-rate ("default" in SSML 1.1).</li>
      <li>Fixed the "computed value" for voice-rate, and added the possibility to combine keywords
        and percentages (to be consistent with 'voice-volume'). Added an example to illustrate
        inheritance and value resolution.</li>
      <li>Renamed voice-family fields to be consistent with SSML.</li>
      <li>Improved the 'voice-family' selection algorithm to cater for language changes.</li>
      <li>Separated definition of semitones (pitch properties).</li>
      <li>More consistent behavior when audio cue URI fails (for whatever reason).</li>
      <li>Enabled voice-family names to contain spaces, matching 'font-family' syntax which is based
        on quoted strings and concatenated identifiers.</li>
      <li>Added a new section to define the relationship of this specification with CSS2.1.</li>
      <li>Added the missing "Computed value" line to each property definition.</li>
      <li>Cleaned-up the list of module dependencies, and removed redundant "module dependencies"
        section.</li>
      <li> Voice age keywords now mapped to SSML ages. </li>
      <li>Improved the pause collapsing prose, removed redundant paragraphs.</li>
      <li>Added the missing 'normal' value for 'voice-stress'.</li>
      <li>Separated the 'absolute' keyword for 'voice-pitch' and 'voice-range'.</li>
      <li>Improved document structure by adding sub-sections.</li>
      <li>Removed the implicit 'inherit' value for all properties.</li>
      <li>Fixed typos and made other minor edits.</li>

    <!-- For reference only, changes in previous draft
      (http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-speech-20110419/#changes) -->
    <!-- ul>
            <li>Removed the "mark" property, see the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Feb/0029.html">Working Group resolution</a></li>
            <li>Added the 'speakability' property and removed the 'none' value of the 'speak' property,
            as per this <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jan/0483.html">discussion</a></li>
            <li>Fixed 'voice-family' grammar as per <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Dec/0231.html">this discussion</a></li>
            <li>The volume level of audio cues can only be set relatively to the inherited 'voice-volume' property (to avoid cues being spoken when the main element is silent, which contradicts the "aural box model").</li>
            <li>Added "HTML" to "CSS defines aural properties that give control over rendering
            XML to speech" in the abstract.</li>
            <li>Removed unused normative links to CSS3 modules (actually moved to informative references), now the only dependency is CSS3 Values and Units.</li>
            <li>Removed issue about the 'sub' SSML element given that the CSS "content" replacement functionality addresses the same requirement.</li>
            <li>Added support for semitones in pitch alterations.</li>
            <li>Added reference to "time" values syntax (s, ms) for 'voice-duration'.</li>
            <li>Moved "content" outside of "phonetics", as the ::before and ::after use-cases do not relate to pronunciation rules (this is actually more similar to audio cues, only applied with text rather than audio files)</li>
            <li>Added prose to explicitly support alphabet other than IPA, via the "x-" vendor-specific prefix.</li>
            <li>Reworked HTML source code to work with the <a href="http://cgi.w3.org/member-bin/process.cgi">members-only W3C pre-processor/generator</a></li>
            <li>Added note about the "speech" and "aural" media types.</li>
            <li>Harmonized all hyperlinks so that CSS properties get auto-linked by the pre-processor</li>
            <li>Clarified computation rules for positive percentages with "+" prefixes (i.e. they do not denote increments, the regular multiplicative behavior is used).</li>
            <li>Fixed IPA URL reference</li>
            <li>Reorganized appendixes</li>
            <li>Fixed minor typos</li>
