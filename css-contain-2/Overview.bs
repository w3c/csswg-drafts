<h2 id='intro'>
Introduction</h2>

	Efficiently rendering a website relies on the User Agent being able to detect what parts of the page are being displayed,
	which parts might affect the currently-displayed section,
	and what can be ignored.

	There are various heuristics that can be used to guess when a given sub-tree is independent of the rest of the page in some manner,
	but they're fragile,
	so innocuous changes to a page may inadvertently make it flunk the heuristics and fall into a slow mode.
	There are also many things that would be good to isolate which are difficult or impossible to detect in a heuristic manner.

	To alleviate these problems
	and allow strong, predictable isolation of a subtree from the rest of the page,
	this specification defines a 'contain' property.

<h3 id="interaction">
Module Interactions</h3>

	This document defines new features not present in earlier specifications.
	In addition, it aims to replace and supersede [[!CSS-CONTAIN-1]]
	once stable.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	This specification follows
	the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]].
	Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values & Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification
	also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> keywords as their property value.
	For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

Strong Containment: the 'contain' property</h2>

	<pre class='propdef'>
		Name: contain
		Value: none | strict | content | [ size || layout || style || paint ]
		Initial: none
		Inherited: no
		Applies to: See <a href="#contain-applies">below</a>
		Computed value: specified keyword(s)
		Animation type: not animatable

	<p class=all-media>User Agents are expected to support this property on all media, including non-visual ones.</p>

	The 'contain' property allows an author to indicate that an element and its contents are,
	as much as possible,
	<em>independent</em> of the rest of the document tree.
	This allows user agents to utilize much stronger optimizations when rendering a page using 'contain' properly,
	and allows authors to be confident that their page won't accidentally fall into a slow code path
	due to an innocuous change.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=contain>
		<dt><dfn>none</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value indicates that the property has no effect.
			The element renders as normal,
			with no containment effects applied.

		<dt><dfn>strict</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value turns on all forms of <a>containment</a> <em>except</em> <a>style containment</a> for the element.
			In other words, it behaves the same as ''contain: size layout paint;''.

			<wpt>

				contain-strict-002.html

				contain-strict-011.html
			</wpt>

		<dt><dfn>content</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value turns on all forms of <a>containment</a> <em>except</em> <a>size containment</a> and <a>style containment</a> for the element.
			In other words, it behaves the same as ''contain: layout paint;''.

			<wpt>

				contain-content-002.html
				contain-content-003.html
				contain-content-004.html
				contain-content-011.html

			</wpt>

			Note: ''contain: content'' is reasonably "safe" to apply widely;
			its effects are fairly minor in practice,
			and most content won't run afoul of its restrictions.
			However, because it doesn't apply <a>size containment</a>,
			the element can still respond to the size of its contents,
			which can cause layout-invalidation to percolate further up the tree than desired.
			Use ''contain: strict'' or ''contain: strict style'' when possible,
			to gain as much containment as you can.

		<dt><dfn>size</dfn>
		<dd>
			The value turns on <a>size containment</a> for the element.
			This ensures that the containing box can be laid out
			without needing to examine its descendants.

	<span id="contain-applies">This property generally applies to all elements (including [[css-pseudo-4#generated-content]])</span>,
	although some types of containment have no effect on some elements,
	as detailed in [[#containment-types]].
	In addition, in the case of [[SVG2]],
	the 'contain' property only applies to <{svg}> elements that have an associated CSS layout box.

	<div class='example'>
		'contain' is useful when used widely on a page,
		particularly when a page contains a lot of "widgets" which are all independent.

		For example, assume a micropost social network had markup something like this:

		<pre><code highlight=markup>
			&lt;body>
				&lt;aside>...&lt;/aside>
				&lt;section>
					&lt;h2>Messages&lt;/h2>
					&lt;article>
						Lol, check out this dog: images.example.com/jsK3jkl
					&lt;/article>
					&lt;article>
						I had a ham sandwich today. #goodtimes
					&lt;/article>
					&lt;article>
						I have political opinions that you need to hear!
					&lt;/article>
					…
				&lt;/section>
			&lt;/body>
		</code></pre>

		There are probably a <em>lot</em> of messages displayed on the site,
		but each is independent and won't affect anything else on the site.
		As such, each can be marked with ''contain: content'' to communicate this to the user agent,
		so it can optimize the page and skip a lot of computation for messages that are off-screen.
		If the size of each message is known ahead of time,
		''contain: strict'' can be applied to communicate further restrictions.
	</div>


<h2 id='containment-types'>
Types of Containment</h2>

	There are several varieties of <dfn export>containment</dfn> that an element can be subject to,
	restricting the effects that its descendants can have on the rest of the page in various ways.
	<a>Containment</a> enables much more powerful optimizations by user agents,
	and helps authors compose their page out of functional units,
	as it limits how widely a given change can affect a document.

	Advisement: Specification authors introducing new properties or mechanisms
	need to consider whether and how the various types of containment
	affect what they are introducing,
	and include in their specification any effect not described here.

<h3 id='containment-size'>
Size Containment</h3>

	If the element does not generate a <a>principal box</a> (as is the case with ''display: contents'' or ''display: none''),
	or its [=inner display type=] is ''display/table'',
	or its principal box is an <a spec="css-display-3">internal table box</a>,
	or an <a spec="css-display-3">internal ruby box</a>,
	or a <a spec="css-display-3" lt="atomic inline">non-atomic</a> <a spec="css-display-3">inline-level</a> box,
	size containment has no effect.
	Otherwise, giving an element <dfn export>size containment</dfn>
	makes its [=principal box=] a <dfn for=size-containment>containing box</dfn> for [=size containment=]
	and has the following effects:

	<wpt>
	contain-size-001.html
	contain-size-002.html
	contain-size-003.html
	contain-size-004.html
	contain-size-005.html
	contain-size-006.html
	contain-size-007.html
	contain-size-008.html
	contain-size-009.html
	contain-size-010.html
	contain-size-012.html
	contain-size-012b.html
	contain-size-051.html
	contain-size-052.html
	</wpt>

	Note: Internal table boxes,
	which do not include table captions,
	are excluded,
	because the table layout algorithm
	does not allow boxes to become smaller than their inflow content.
	Sizing a table cell as if it was empty and then layout out its content inside without changing the size
	is effectively an undefined operation.
	Manually setting the 'width' or 'height' properties to ''0''
	cannot make it smaller than its content.
	This concern does not apply to table captions,
	which are perfectly capable of having a fixed size
	that is independent of their content.

	<wpt>
	contain-size-011.html
	contain-size-056.html
	</wpt>

	1. When calculating the size of the [=size-containment/containing box=],
		it must be treated as having no contents.

		<wpt>
		contain-size-021.html
		contain-size-023.html
		contain-size-025.html
		contain-size-027.html
		contain-size-061.html
		contain-size-062.html
		contain-size-borders.html
		contain-size-fieldset-001.html
		contain-size-fieldset-002.html
		contain-size-select-001.html
		contain-size-select-002.html
		contain-size-scrollbars-001.html
		contain-size-scrollbars-002.html
		contain-size-scrollbars-003.html

		contain-size-button-001.html
		contain-size-flexbox-001.html
		contain-size-flexbox-002.html
		contain-size-grid-001.html
		</wpt>

		Note: Even when the element's [=sizing properties=] are ''height/auto''
		this does not necessarily make the element zero-sized:
		properties set on the element itself,
		such as the 'columns' property or the 'grid' property,
		continue to be taken into account.

		<wpt>
		contain-size-grid-002.html
		contain-size-grid-003.html
		contain-size-multicol-001.html
		contain-size-multicol-as-flex-item.html
		</wpt>

		Then,
		its contents must then be laid out into the [=size-containment/containing box=]'s resolved size.

		Note: [=size containment=] does not suppress baseline alignment.
		See [=layout containment=] for that.

		<wpt>
		contain-size-baseline-001.html
		</wpt>

		<a>Replaced elements</a> must be treated as having an intrinsic width and height of 0.

		<wpt>
		contain-size-013.html
		contain-size-041.html
		contain-size-042.html
		contain-size-replaced-001.html
		contain-size-replaced-002.html
		contain-size-replaced-003a.html
		contain-size-replaced-003b.html
		contain-size-replaced-003c.html
		contain-size-replaced-004.html
		contain-size-replaced-005.html
		contain-size-replaced-006.html
		</wpt>
	2. [=size-containment/Containing boxes=] for <a>size containment</a> are <a spec=css-break-3>monolithic</a> (See [[CSS-BREAK-3#possible-breaks]]).

		<wpt>
		contain-size-breaks-001.html
		contain-size-monolithic-001.html
		</wpt>

	By itself, <a>size containment</a> does not offer much optimization opportunity.
	Its primary benefit on its own is that tools which want to lay out the containing box's contents
	based on the containing box's size
	(such as a JS library implementing the "container query" concept)
	can do so without fear of "infinite loops",
	where having a child's size respond to the size of the containing box
	causes the containing box's size to change as well,
	possibly triggering <em>further</em> changes in how the child sizes itself
	and possibly thus more changes to the containing box's size,
	ad infinitum.

	When paired with <a>layout containment</a>, though,
	possible optimizations that can be enabled include (but are not limited to):

	1. When the style or contents of a descendant of the containing box is changed,
		calculating what part of the DOM tree is "dirtied" and might need to be re-laid out
		can stop at the containing box.

	2. When laying out the page,
		if the containing box is off-screen or obscured,
		the layout of its contents can be delayed or done at a lower priority.

<h3 id='containment-layout'>
Layout Containment</h3>

	If the element does not generate a <a>principal box</a> (as is the case with 'display' values of ''display/contents'' or ''display/none''),
	or its [=principal box=] is an <a spec="css-display-3">internal table box</a> other than ''display/table-cell'',
	or an <a spec="css-display-3">internal ruby box</a>,
	or a <a spec="css-display-3" lt="atomic inline">non-atomic</a> <a spec="css-display-3">inline-level</a> box,
	layout containment has no effect.
	Otherwise, giving an element <dfn export>layout containment</dfn>
	makes its [=principal box=] a <dfn for=layout-containment>containing box</dfn> for [=layout containment=]
	and has the following effects:

	<wpt>
	contain-layout-001.html
	contain-layout-002.html
	contain-layout-003.html
	contain-layout-004.html
	contain-layout-005.html
	contain-layout-009.html
	contain-layout-010.html
	contain-layout-011.html
	contain-layout-012.html
	contain-layout-013.html
	contain-layout-014.html
	contain-layout-independent-formatting-context-003.html
	</wpt>

	1. The [=layout-containment/containing box=] [=establishes an independent formatting context=].

		<wpt>
		contain-layout-ifc-022.html
		contain-layout-independent-formatting-context-001.html
		contain-layout-independent-formatting-context-002.html
		contain-subgrid-001.html
		</wpt>

	2. If at least one [=fragmentation container=] of a [=fragmentation context=] has [=layout containment=],
		or if at least one [=fragmentation container=] of a [=fragmentation context=] is a descendant of [=layout-containment/containing box=] for layout containment
		<strong>and</strong> at least one subsequent [=fragmentation container=] of the same [=fragmentation context=]
		is not a descendant of that same element with layout containment,
		then the first [=layout-containment/containing box=] for [=layout containment=]
		which is either a [=fragmentation container=] itself
		or is an ancestor of a [=fragmentation container=]
		must “trap” the remainder of the [=fragmented flow=]:
		[=fragmentation=] must not continue past the [=layout containment=] boundary,
		and the last [=fragmentation container=]
		within the first [=layout containment=] boundary
		is treated as if it is the last [=fragmentation container=]
		in its [=fragmentation context=].

		If subsequent [=fragmentation containers=] in the [=fragmentation context=]
		are only generated when more content remains in the [=fragmented flow=],
		then they are not generated.
		If they would exist regardless,
		they remain part of the [=fragmentation context=],
		but do not receive any content from the [=fragmented flow=].

		Note: At the time of writing, no stable specification is affected by this point.
		Only specifications that would enable some (but not all) fragmentation containers of a fragmentation context
		to be layout-contained (or descendants of a layout contained element)
		are concerned.
		This is not the case of [[CSS-PAGE-3]] nor of [[CSS-MULTICOL-1]].
		This requirement is nonetheless included because
		several mechanisms that would make this a possibility have been considered
		(e.g.: [[CSS-REGIONS-1]], ''::nth-fragment()'', a hypothetical selector for individual columns of a multicol…),
		and the guarantees that layout containment is intended to offer would not be realized
		if such mechanisms did not abide by this rule.
		[[CSS-REGIONS-1]] has details over how <a>layout containment</a> affects
		regions.

				&lt;/aside>
				&lt;div id=f>&lt;/div>
			</code></pre>
			<pre><code highlight=css>
				article {flow-into: foo;}
				#a, #b, #c, #d, #e, #f {flow-from: foo;}
				aside {contain: layout}
			</code></pre>

			In this [[CSS-REGIONS-1]] example,
			content can flow from <code>#a</code> to <code>#b</code>,
			from <code>#b</code> to <code>#c</code>.
			However as <code>#c</code> is the last fragment container in the first containing box for layout containment,
			it traps all the remaining content,
			and nothing gets flowed into <code>#d</code>, <code>#e</code>, or <code>#f</code>.
		</div>

	3. If the computed value of the 'overflow' property is
		either ''overflow/visible'' or ''overflow/clip'' or a combination thereof,
		any overflow must be treated as [=ink overflow=].

	4. The [=layout-containment/containing box=] acts as a containing block for absolutely positioned and fixed positioned descendants.

		contain-layout-006.html
		contain-layout-007.html
		contain-layout-cell-001.html
		contain-layout-cell-002.html
		</wpt>

	5. The [=layout-containment/containing box=] creates a <a>stacking context</a>.

		<wpt>
		contain-layout-016.html
		contain-layout-017.html
		contain-layout-018.html
		</wpt>

	6. [=Forced breaks=] are allowed within [=layout-containment/containing boxes=] for [=layout containment=],
		but do not propagate to the parent as otherwise described in [[CSS-BREAK-3#break-between]].

		<wpt>
		contain-layout-breaks-001.html
		contain-layout-breaks-002.html
		</wpt>

		Note: This introduces the previously non-existent possibility that [=forced breaks=]
		may occur between a box and its container (See [[CSS-BREAK-3#possible-breaks]]).

	7. For the purpose of the 'vertical-align' property,
		or any other property whose effects
		need to relate the position of the [=layout-containment/containing box=]'s baseline
		to something other than its descendants,
		the [=layout-containment/containing box=] is treated as having no baseline.

		<wpt>
		contain-layout-baseline-001.html
		contain-layout-button-001.html
		contain-layout-flexbox-001.html
		contain-layout-grid-001.html
		contain-layout-baseline-002.html
		contain-layout-baseline-003.html
		contain-layout-baseline-004.html
		contain-layout-baseline-005.html
		</wpt>

	Possible optimizations that can be enabled by <a>layout containment</a> include (but are not limited to):

	1. When laying out the page,
		the contents of separate containing boxes
		can be laid out in parallel,
		as they're guaranteed not to affect each other.

	2. When laying out the page,
		if the containing box is off-screen or obscured
		and the layout of the visible parts of the screen do not depend on the size of the containing box
		(for example, if the containing box is near the end of a block container,
		and you're viewing the beginning of the block container),
		the layout of the containing box' contents can be delayed or done at a lower priority.

		(When paired with <a>size containment</a>,
		this optimization can be applied more liberally.)

Style Containment</h3>

	Note: Style Containment is at-risk.

	Giving an element <dfn export>style containment</dfn>
	and has the following effects:

	1. The 'counter-increment' and 'counter-set' properties
	    must be <a for=property>scoped to the element's sub-tree</a>
	    and create a new counter.

	    <wpt>
	    contain-style-counters-001.html
	    contain-style-counters-002.html
	    contain-style-counters-003.html
	    contain-style-counters-004.html
	    </wpt>

	2. The effects of the 'content' property's
	    ''content/open-quote'', ''content/close-quote'', ''content/no-open-quote'' and ''content/no-close-quote''
	    must be <a for=property>scoped to the element's sub-tree</a>.

	    Note: This implies that the depth of quote nesting in the subtree
	    is unchanged and starts at the value that its context normally implies,
	    but that changes to the depth of quote nesting by these values inside the subtree
	    do not affect the depth of quote nesting outside the subtree.

	    <wpt>
	    quote-scoping-001.html
	    quote-scoping-002.html
	    quote-scoping-003.html
	    quote-scoping-004.html
	    </wpt>

	<wpt>

	contain-style-breaks-003.html
	contain-style-breaks-004.html
	contain-style-breaks-005.html
	</wpt>

	Note: [[CSS-REGIONS-1]] has normative requirements on how <a>style containment</a> affects regions.

	A <dfn export for=property lt="scoped | scoped property | scoped properties">scoped property</dfn> has its effects scoped to a particular element or subtree.

	* If <dfn export for=property lt="scoped to an element | scoped to the element">scoped to an element</dfn>,
	    it must act as if the scoping element was the root of the document
	    for the purpose of evaluating the property's effects:
	    any uses of the property outside the scoping element must have no effect on the uses of the property on or in the scoping element,
	    and vice versa.

	    Note: “Scoping to an element” is currently unused.
	    It is defined as an extension point for future specifications to use.

	* If <dfn export for=property lt="scoped to a sub-tree | scoped to the sub-tree | scoped to the element's sub-tree | scoped to an element's sub-tree">scoped to a sub-tree</dfn>, it's the same,
	    except the scoping element itself is counted as "outside" the tree,
	    like the rest of the document,
	    and the effects of the property on that element are unaffected by scoping.
	    When considering the effects of the scoped property on elements <em>inside</em> the subtree,
	    the element at the base of the subtree is treated as if it was the root of the document.

	    <wpt>
	    counter-scoping-001.html
	    counter-scoping-002.html
	    counter-scoping-003.html
	    </wpt>

	<div class=example>
	As 'counter-increment' is scoped to an element's subtree,
	the first use of it within the subtree acts as if the named counter were set to 0 at the scoping element,
	regardless of whether the counter had been used outside the scoping element.
	Any increments made within the subtree have no effect on counters of the same name outside the scoping element.
	However, the ''content/counter()'' and ''content/counters()'' value of the 'content' property is not itself scoped,
	and can refer to counters established outside of the subtree.
	Therefore, the following code results in <q><samp>1 1.2</samp></q> being displayed:
	<pre><code highlight=markup>
	&lt;div>&lt;/div>
	</code></pre>
	<pre><code highlight=css>
	div {
		contain: style;
		counter-increment: n;
	}
	div::before, div::after {
		content: counters(n, '.') " ";
	}
	div::after {
		counter-increment: n 2;
	}
	</code></pre>
	</div>

	Possible optimizations that can be enabled by <a>style containment</a> include (but are not limited to):

	1. Whenever a property is changed on a descendant of an element with [=style containment=],
		calculating what part of the DOM tree is "dirtied" and might need to have its style recalculated
		can stop at the containing box.

<h3 id='containment-paint'>
Paint Containment</h3>

	If the element does not generate a <a>principal box</a> (as is the case with 'display' values of ''display/contents'' or ''display/none''),
	or its [=principal box=] is an <a spec="css-display-3">internal table box</a> other than ''display/table-cell'',
	or an <a spec="css-display-3">internal ruby box</a>,
	or a <a spec="css-display-3" lt="atomic inline">non-atomic</a> <a spec="css-display-3">inline-level</a> box,
	paint containment has no effect.
	Otherwise, giving an element <dfn export>paint containment</dfn>
	makes its [=principal box=] a <dfn for=paint-containment>containing box</dfn> for [=paint containment=]
	and has the following effects:

	<wpt>
	contain-paint-002.html
	contain-paint-005.html

	</wpt>

	1. The contents of the element
		including both the paint of the descendants and their geometry
		must be clipped to the <a>padding edge</a> of the [=paint-containment/containing box=],
		taking <a>corner clipping</a> into account.
		This does not include the creation of any mechanism
		to access or indicate the presence of the clipped content;
		nor does it inhibit the creation of any such mechanism through other properties,
		<span class=informative>such as 'overflow', 'resize', or 'text-overflow'</span>.
		<span class=note>This is as if ''overflow: visible'' was changed to ''overflow: clip'' at used value.</span>

<div class=informative>
	Possible optimizations that can be enabled by <a>paint containment</a> include (but are not limited to):

	1. If the containing box is off-screen or obscured,
		the UA can directly skip trying to paint its contents,
		as they're guaranteed to be off-screen/obscured as well.

	2. Unless the clipped content is made accessible via a separate mechanism
		such as the 'overflow', 'resize', or 'text-overflow' properties,
		the UA can reserve "canvas" space for the box exactly the box's size.
		(In similar, scrollable, situations, like ''overflow: hidden'',
		it's possible to scroll to the currently-clipped content,
		so UAs often predictively overpaint somewhat
		so there's something to see as soon as the scroll happens,
		rather than a frame later.)

	3. Because they are guaranteed to be stacking contexts,
		scrolling elements can be painted into a single GPU layer.
