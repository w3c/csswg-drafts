<h2 id="introduction">1 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Tests not needed.

<h3 id="module-interactions">1.1 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#placement">Module Interactions</a></h3>

<p>Tests not needed.

<h3 id="values">1.2 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#values">Values</a></h3>

<p>Tests not really needed.

<p>Possible addition:

<ul>
	<li>Check that the css-wide keywords work on every property.
</ul>

<h3 id="languages-and-typesetting">1.3 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#languages">Languages and Typesetting</a></h3>

<p>Tests not really needed: these are definitions, they get tested through their applications, not standalone.

<p>Possible addition:

<ul>
	<li>whether The HTTP Content-Language header is having the desired effect on things that depend on content language
</ul>

<h3 id="characters-and-letters">1.4 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#characters">Characters and Letters</a></h3>

<p>For the most part, tests not really needed:
these are definitions, they get tested through their applications, not standalone.
The few testable assertions that are made have coverage.

<p>Possible addition:

<ul>
	<li>turning the content of example 1 into tests (first, check that it’s not already done)
</ul>

<h3 id="text-processing">1.5 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#text-encoding">Text Processing</a></h3>

<p>Adequate coverage.

<p>Exhaustive coverage unrealistic, since this section is effectively a dependency on all of Unicode.
Some tests nonetheless provided for sanity checking
(such as the effect of certain control characters on Arabic shaping).

<h2 id="transforming-text">2 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#transforming">Transforming Text</a></h2>

<p>Test only needed in subsection.

<h3 id="case-transforms-the-text-transform-property">2.1 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#text-transform-property"> Case Transforms: the text-transform property</a></h3>

<p>Overall good coverage. Very good i18n coverage.

<p>Missing:

<ul>
	<li>No test of Animation type.
</ul>

<p>Possible addition:
<ul>
	<li>An automated test for plain text copy&amp;paste not applying transforms. Not clear such an <em>automated</em> test is possible, but it would be nice to have one if it were.
</ul>

<h2 id="white-space-and-wrapping-the-white-space-property">3 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#white-space-property">White Space and Wrapping: the white-space property</a></h2>

<p>Good overal coverage through section 4 (white space processing details) and subsections.

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>
	<li>wrappable inlines inside white-space:pre blocks don’t get ignored
	<li>No test of Animation type.
	<li>intrinsic (min and max) sizing tests for values other than pre-wrap and break-spaces
</ul>

<p>Possible addition:
<ul>
	<li>coverage of "break-spaces" not as exhaustive as other values. Basic behavior is covered, and difference from "pre-wrap" is covered as well, so this is adequate, but it doesn't have the long list of basic tests that other values got from the CSS2 test suite.
</ul>

<h2 id="white-space-processing-details">4 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#white-space-processing">White Space Processing Details</a></h2>

<p>Partial coverage.

<p>Missing tests:

<h4 id="segment-break-transformation-rules">4.1.2 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#line-break-transform">Segment Break Transformation Rules</a></h4>

<p>Partial coverage.

<p>Indirectly tested, no dedicated tests:

<ul>
	<li>When 'white-space' is ''break-spaces'' segment breaks are not collapsible and are instead transformed into a preserved line feed (U+000A).
</ul>

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>
	<li>the first 3 bullet points are not tested for “nowrap”
	<li>“Otherwise, if the writing system of the segment break is Chinese, Japanese, or Yi, […]”
	<li>For this purpose, Emoji (Unicode property Emoji) with an East Asian Width property of W or N are treated as having an East Asian Width property of A.
        <li>“Otherwise, the segment break is converted to a space (U+0020).”
	<li>inline element boundary and out of flow elements have no effect on these rules
</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="line-breaking-and-word-boundaries">5 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#line-breaking">Line Breaking and Word Boundaries</a></h2>

<p>Tests not really needed: these are definitions, they get tested through their applications, not standalone.

<p>Can be a good section to host tests for i18n requirements not covered in detail by the spec.

<p>Possible Additions:

<ul>
	<li>Basic line breaking tests for any language mentioned (Thai, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, Balinese, Yi…)
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>“Regardless of the white-space value […] the BK, NL […] classes […] must be honored”
	<li>For soft wrap opportunities before the first or after the last character of a box, the break occurs immediately before/after the box (at its margin edge) rather than breaking the box between its content edge and the content.
</ul>

<p>Untestable(?):

<ul>
	<li>UAs that allow wrapping at punctuation other than spaces should prioritize breakpoints. […]
</ul>

<h3 id="breaking-rules-for-letters-the-word-break-property">5.2 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#word-break-property">Breaking Rules for Letters: the word-break property</a></h3>

	<li>and/or non-letter typographic character units belonging to the NU, AL, AI, or ID Unicode line breaking classes [UAX14]
	<li>effect of word-break:keep-all on NU and AI classes
	<li>Symbols that line-break the same way as letters of a particular category are affected the same way as those letters.
	<li>does not suppress <code>&lt;wbr></code>
</ul>

<p>Covered, but could have more:

<ul>
	<li>It does not affect rules governing the soft wrap opportunities created around punctuation
</ul>

<h3 id="line-breaking-strictness-the-line-break-property">5.3 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#line-break-property">Line Breaking Strictness: the line-break property</a></h3>

</ul>

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>
	<li>applies to inlines
	<li>No test of Animation type.
	<li>Affects intrinsic sizing
	<li>none value
	<li>none does not suppress wrapping after an actual hyphen
	<li>basic behavior of auto when lang is declared and there’s no soft hyphen
	<li>However, if, even after breaking at such opportunities, a portion of that word is is still too long to fit on one line, an automatic hyphenation opportunity may be used.
</ul>

<p>Partial Coverage.

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>
	<li>If (after justification, if any) the inline contents of a line box are too long to fit within it, then the contents are start-aligned: any content that doesn’t fit overflows the line box’s end edge.
	<li>If the UA chooses to adjust the text, then it must ensure that tab stops continue to line up
	<li>“Values other than justify-all or match-parent are assigned to text-align-all and reset text-align-last to auto.”, and being a shorthand in general
</ul>

<h3 id="default-text-alignment-the-text-align-all-property">6.2 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#text-align-all-property">Default Text Alignment: the text-align-all property</a></h3>

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>

	<li>computed / resolved value of normal
	<li>&lt;length&gt; Specifies extra spacing in addition
	<li>negative values are allowed
	<li>doesn’t do anything between words defined by text analysis like in Thai, only on actual word separators
	<li>if a word-separating character has a zero advance width (such as the zero width space U+200B) then the user agent must not create an additional spacing between words.
	<li>General punctuation and fixed-width spaces (such as U+3000 and U+2000 through U+200A) are not considered word-separator characters.
	<li>word-spacing and bidi
	<li>Tests for <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3878">https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3878</a>

	<li>is in addition to any word-spacing
	<li>inherit lengths as absolute
	<li>&lt;length&gt; Specifies extra spacing in addition
	<li>negative values are allowed
	<li>For legacy reasons, a computed letter-spacing of zero yields a resolved value (getComputedStyle() return value) of normal.
	<li>For the purpose of letter-spacing, each consecutive run of atomic inlines (such as images and inline blocks) is treated as a single typographic character unit.
	<li>When the effective spacing between two characters is not zero (due to either justification or a non-zero value of letter-spacing), user agents should not apply optional ligatures
	<li>However, ligatures and other font features specified via the low-level font-feature-settings property take precedence over this rule

<p>No Tests.

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>

	<li>Grapheme clusters formed with a Space Separator (Zs) as the base are considered to be Modifier Symbols (Sk). They are assumed to have the same East Asian Width property as the base, but take their other properties from the first combining character in the sequence.
