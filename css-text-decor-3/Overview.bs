<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	<em>This subsection is non-normative.</em>

	This module covers text decoration, i.e. decorating the glyphs
	of the text once typeset according to font and typographic rules.
	(See [[CSS-TEXT-3]] and [[CSS-FONTS-3]].)
	Such features are traditionally used not only for purely decorative purposes,
	but also in some cases to show emphasis, for honorifics,
	and to indicate editorial changes such as insertions, deletions, and misspellings.

	CSS Levels 1 and 2 only defined very basic <a href="#line-decoration">line decorations</a>
	(underlines, overlines, and strike-throughs)
	appropriate to Western typographical traditions.
	Level 3 of this module adds the ability to change
	the color, style, position, and continuity of these decorations,
	and also introduces
	<a href="#emphasis-marks">emphasis marks</a> (traditionally used in East Asian typography),
	and <a href="#text-shadow-property">shadows</a> (which were proposed then deferred from Level 2).

<h3 id="placement">
Module Interactions</h3>

	This module replaces and extends the text-decorating
	features defined in [[!CSS2]] chapter 16.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	This specification follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]].
	Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values & Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
	Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification
	also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> keywords as their property value.
	For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

<h3 id="terms">Terminology</h3>

	The terms <dfn><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#grapheme-cluster">character</a></dfn>,
	<dfn><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#letter">letter</a></dfn>, and
	<dfn><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#content-language">content language</a></dfn>
	as used in this specification are defined in [[!CSS-TEXT-3]].
	Other terminology and concepts used in this specification are defined
	in [[!CSS2]] and [[!CSS-WRITING-MODES-4]].

<h2 id="line-decoration">
Line Decoration: Underline, Overline, and Strike-Through</h2>


	The following properties describe line decorations that are added to the content of an element.
	When specified on or propagated to an <a>inline box</a>,
	that <a>box</a> becomes a <dfn>decorating box</dfn> for that decoration,
	applying the decoration to all its <a>fragments</a>.
	The decoration is then further propagated to any <a>in-flow</a> <a>block-level</a> boxes that split the inline
	(see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#anonymous-block-level">CSS2.1 section 9.2.1.1</a>).
	When specified on or propagated to a <a>block container</a> that establishes an <a>inline formatting context</a>,
	the decorations are propagated to an <a>anonymous</a> inline box that wraps all the <a>in-flow</a> <a>inline-level</a> children of the <a>block container</a>.
	When specified on or propagated to a <a>ruby container</a>,
	the decorations are propagated only to the <a>ruby base</a>.
	For all other box types,
	the decorations are propagated to all in-flow children.

	<p class="note">
		Note that text decorations are not propagated to any out-of-flow descendants,
		nor to the contents of atomic inline-level descendants such as inline blocks and inline tables.
		They are also not propagated to inline children of inline boxes,
		although the decoration is <em>applied</em> to such boxes.


	Underlines, overlines, and line-throughs are drawn only for <a>non-replaced</a> <a>inline boxes</a>,
	and are drawn across all text (including white space, letter spacing, and word spacing)
	except spacing (white space, letter spacing, and word spacing) at the beginning and end of a line.
	<a>Atomic inlines</a>, such as images and inline blocks, are not decorated.
	Margins, borders, and padding of the <i>decorating box</i> are always skipped,
	however the margins, border, and padding of descendant <a>inline boxes</a> are not.

	<p class='note'>
		Note that CSS 2.1 required skipping margins, borders, and padding always.
		In this level, by default only the margins, borders, and padding of the <i>decorating box</i> are skipped.
		In the future CSS2.1 may be updated to match this new default.
		Also, control over decorating leading/trailing spaces is expected in Level 4,
		and will be applied by default to the HTML <{ins}> and <{del}> elements.


	UAs <em>may</em> interrupt underlines and overlines where the line would cross glyph ink
	and to some distance to either side of the glyph outline;
	this behavior is not controllable in this level,
	but will be further defined in Level 4.
	Line-throughs must remain continuous, however.

	<div class="figure">
		<img title="Skipping Descenders When Drawing an Underline"
		     alt="An alphabetic underline through Myanmar text skips around descenders and the vertical strokes of combining characters that drop below the alphabetic baseline."
		     src="images/decoration-skip-ink.png">
		<p class="caption">Skipping Glyph Ink
	</div>

	When the UA interrupts underlines or overlines at glyph boundaries,
	the shape of the line at that boundary should
	follow the shape of the glyph.

	<div class="note">
		Note, this specification intentionally does not mandate a particular method
		for “following the shape” of the glyph
		so that UAs can take appropriate measures to handle
		aesthetic and performance considerations.
		For example,
		a UA could assume square line endings below a certain size threshold
		for performance reasons;
		or use trapezoidal endings to approximate curves,
		especially on thinner line decorations.
		In terms of aesthetic considerations,
		the UA might also consider what happens when the glyph boundary
		intersects only part of the line thickness
		or is slanted close to the horizontal--
		following the curve exactly
		could result in typographically-awkward wisps of underline.
		Whether to show the line within enclosed areas of a glyph is yet
		another consideration.

		<div class="figure">
			<img title="Wispy Leftovers of a Masked-Out Underline"
			       alt="Take, for example, the word “goal” with an underline striking through the bottom loop of the “g”.
			            Depending on the position and thickness of the underline,
			            we might see the entire thickness of the underline, or only part of it within the “g”.
			            This example shows a masked-out underline in two positions.
			            In the left pair the underline passes through the center of the bowl of the “g”:
			            the full thickness of the underline shows through the center,
			            filling it.
			            In the right pair the underline is slightly lower,
			            and thus the portion of the underline within the “g” can only show a partial thickness."
			       src="images/skip-ink-wisp.png">
			<p class="caption">
			Hiding the portion of the underline within the bowl gives a cleaner look to the type,
			while the curved ends of the underline outside it
			suggest the continuity of the underline through the letter
			by hugging its outer contour.
		</div>

	</div>

	Relatively positioning a descendant moves all text decorations
	applied to it along with the descendant's text; it does not affect
	calculation of the decoration's initial position on that line.
	The 'visibility' property, 'text-shadow', filters, and other graphical transformations
	likewise affect text decorations as part of the text they're drawn on,
	even if the decorations were specified on an ancestor box,
	and do not affect the calculation of their initial positions or thicknesses.
	(In the case of line decorations drawn over an atomic inline
	or across the margins/borders/padding of a non-replaced inline box,
	they are analogously associated with the affected atomic inline / non-replaced inline box
	rather than with the <i>decorating box</i>.)

	<div class="example">
		In the following style sheet and document fragment:
		<pre>
		  blockquote { text-decoration: underline; color: blue; }
		  em { display: block; }
		  cite { color: fuchsia; }
		</pre>
		<pre>
		  &lt;blockquote&gt;
		   &lt;p&gt;
		    &lt;span&gt;
		     Help, help!
		     &lt;em&gt; I am under a hat! &lt;/em&gt;

		     &lt;cite&gt; &mdash;GwieF &lt;/cite&gt;
		    &lt;/span&gt;
		   &lt;/p&gt;
		  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
		</pre>
		...the underlining for the blockquote element is propagated to an
		anonymous inline box that surrounds the span element, causing
		the text "Help, help!" to be blue, with the blue underlining from
		the anonymous inline underneath it, the color being taken from the
		blockquote element. The <code>&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;</code>
		in the em block is also underlined, as it is in an in-flow block to
		which the underline is propagated. The final line of text is fuchsia,
		but the underline underneath it is still the blue underline from the
		anonymous inline element.
		<img src="images/underline-example.png" alt="Sample rendering of the above underline example">
		This diagram shows the boxes involved in the example above. The
		rounded aqua line represents the anonymous inline element wrapping
		the inline contents of the paragraph element, the rounded blue line
		represents the span element, and the orange lines represent the
		blocks.
	</div>

	Note: Line decorations are propagated through the box tree,
	not through inheritance,
	and thus have no effect on descendants
	when specified on an element with ''display: contents''.

<h3 id="text-decoration-line-property">
Text Decoration Lines: the 'text-decoration-line' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-decoration-line
	Value: none | [ underline || overline || line-through || blink ]
	Initial: none
	Inherited: no (but see prose, above)
	Computed value: specified keyword(s)
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	Specifies what line decorations, if any, are added to the element.
	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-line">none</dfn>
		<dd>
		  Neither produces nor inhibits text decoration.
		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-line">underline</dfn>
		<dd>
		  Each line of text is underlined.
		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-line">overline</dfn>
		<dd>
		  Each line of text has a line over it (i.e. on the opposite
		  side from an underline).
		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-line">line-through</dfn>
		  <dd>
		  Each line of text has a line through the middle.
		<dt><dfn value for="text-decoration-line">blink</dfn>
		<dd>
		  The text blinks (alternates between visible and invisible).
		  Conforming user agents may simply not blink the text.
		  Note that not blinking the text is one technique to satisfy <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG/guidelines.html#tech-on-off-blinking-text">checkpoint 3.3 of WAI-UAAG</a>.
		  This value is <strong>deprecated</strong> in favor of Animations [[CSS-ANIMATIONS-1]].
	</dl>

	Note: In <a>vertical writing modes</a>,
	'text-underline-position' can cause the underline and overline to switch sides.
	This allows the position of underlines to key off of language-specific preferences
	automatically.

<h3 id="text-decoration-style-property">
Text Decoration Style: the 'text-decoration-style' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-decoration-style
	Value: solid | double | dotted | dashed | wavy
	Initial: solid
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: specified keyword
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	This property specifies the style of the line(s) drawn for
	text decoration specified on the element. Values have the
	same meaning as for the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#the-border-style">border-style
	properties</a> [[!CSS-BACKGROUNDS-3]]. ''wavy'' indicates a wavy line.

	The style of text decorations must remain the same on all decorations originating from a given element,
	even if descendant boxes have different specified styles.


<h3 id="text-decoration-color-property">
Text Decoration Color: the 'text-decoration-color' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-decoration-color
	Value: <<color>>
	Initial: currentcolor
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: computed color
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	This property specifies the color of text decoration (underlines
	overlines, and line-throughs) set on the element with
	'text-decoration-line'.

	The color of text decorations must remain the same on all decorations originating from a given element,
	even if descendant boxes have different specified colors.


<h3 id="text-decoration-property">
Text Decoration Shorthand: the 'text-decoration' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef shorthand">
	Name: text-decoration
	Value: <<'text-decoration-line'>> || <<'text-decoration-style'>> || <<'text-decoration-color'>>
	</pre>

	This property is a shorthand for setting 'text-decoration-line',
	'text-decoration-color', and 'text-decoration-style' in one declaration.
	Omitted values are set to their initial values. A 'text-decoration'
	declaration that omits both the 'text-decoration-color'
	and 'text-decoration-style' values is backwards-compatible
	with CSS Levels 1 and 2.

	<div class="example">
		The following example underlines unvisited links with a solid blue
		underline in CSS1 and CSS2 UAs and a navy dotted underline in CSS3 UAs.

		<pre>
			link {
			  color: blue;
			  text-decoration: underline;
			  text-decoration: navy dotted underline; /* <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#ignore">Ignored</a> in CSS1/CSS2 UAs */
			}
		</pre>
	</div>

	Note: The shorthand purposefully omits the 'text-underline-position' property,
	which is a language/writing-system–dependent setting that keys off the content,
	so that it can cascade and inherit independently
	from the (uninherited) stylistic settings of the 'text-decoration' shorthand.

<h3 id="text-underline-position-property">
Text Underline Position: the 'text-underline-position' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-underline-position
	Value: auto | [ under || [ left | right ] ]
	Initial: auto
	Inherited: yes
	Computed value: specified keyword(s)
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	This property sets the position of an underline specified on the element.
	(It does not affect underlines specified by ancestor elements.)
	If ''text-underline-position/left'' or ''text-underline-position/right'' is specified alone,
	''text-underline-position/auto'' is also implied.

	<div class="example">
		The following example styles modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
		texts with the appropriate underline positions in both horizontal
		and vertical text:
		<pre>
			:root:lang(ja), [lang|=ja], :root:lang(ko), [lang|=ko] { text-underline-position: under right; }
			:root:lang(zh), [lang|=zh] { text-underline-position: under left; }
		</pre>
	</div>

	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn id="underline-auto" value for="text-underline-position">auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			The user agent may use any algorithm to determine the
			underline's position; however it must be placed at or under
			the alphabetic baseline.

			Note: It is suggested that the default underline position
			be close to the alphabetic baseline,
			unless that would either cross subscripted (or otherwise lowered) text
			or draw over glyphs from Asian scripts such as Han or Tibetan
			for which an alphabetic underline is too high:
			in such cases, shifting the underline lower
			or aligning to the em box edge as described for ''text-underline-position/under''
			may be more appropriate.

			<div class="figure">
				<img title="text-underline-position: alphabetic"
				    alt="In a typical Latin font, the underline is positioned slightly
				         below the alphabetic baseline, leaving a gap between the line
				         and the bottom of most Latin letters, but crossing through
				         descenders such as the stem of a 'p'."
				    src="images/underline-position-alphabetic.png" >
				<p class="caption">A typical “alphabetic” underline is positioned just below the alphabetic baseline
			</div>

		<dt><dfn id="underline-under" value for="text-underline-position">under</dfn>
		<dd>
			The underline is positioned <i>under</i> the element's text content.
			In this case the underline usually does not cross the descenders.
			(This is sometimes called “accounting” underline.)
			This value can be combined with ''text-underline-position/left'' or ''text-underline-position/right''
			if a particular side is preferred in vertical <a>typographic modes</a>.
			<div class="figure">
			  <img title="text-underline-position: under"
			      alt="In a typical Latin font, the underline is far enough
			           below the text that it does not cross the bottom of a 'g'."
			      src="images/underline-position-under.png">
			  <p class="caption">''text-underline-position: under''
			</div>
			<div class="example">
				Because 'text-underline-position' inherits, and is not reset
				by the 'text-decoration' shorthand, the following example
				switches the document to use ''text-underline-position/under'' underlining, which can
				be more appropriate for writing systems  with long, complicated
				descenders. It is also often useful for mathematical or chemical
				texts that use many subscripts.

				<pre>:root { text-underline-position: under; }</pre>
			</div>

			Note: The ''text-decoration/under'' value does not guarantee
			that the underline will not conflict with glyphs,
			as some fonts have descenders or diacritics
			that extend below the font’s descent metrics.

		<dt><dfn id="underline-left" value for="text-underline-position">left</dfn>
		<dd>
			In vertical <a>typographic modes</a>, the underline is aligned as for
			''text-underline-position/under'', except it is always aligned to the left edge of the text.
			If this causes the underline to be drawn on the "over" side of
			the text, then an overline also switches sides and is drawn on
			the "under" side.

		<dt><dfn id="underline-right" value for="text-underline-position">right</dfn>
		<dd>
			In vertical <a>typographic modes</a>, the underline is aligned as for

			treated as ''text-underline-position/under''.)
	</div>

	The exact position and thickness of line decorations is UA-defined in this level.
	However, for underlines and overlines
	the UA must use a single thickness and position on each line
	for the decorations deriving from a single <i>decorating box</i>.

	<div class="figure">
		<img src="images/underline-single.png"
		        alt="A single underline drawn under varying font sizes and vertical positions must be a single line.">
		   vs.
		   <img src="images/underline-broken.png"
		        alt="Drawing multiple line segments, each with the position and thickness appropriate to the decorated text, is incorrect.">
		<p class="caption">Correct and incorrect rendering of <code>&lt;u>A&lt;sup>B&lt;/sup>&lt;big>C&lt;/big>D&lt;/u></code>
	</div>

	<div class="note">
		Note, since line decorations can span elements with varying font sizes and
		vertical alignments, the best position for a line decoration is not
		necessarily the ideal position dictated by the <i>decorating box</i>.
		For example, an overline positioned to a small font
		will effectively become a line-through if the element contains text in a significantly larger font-size.
		Even for underlines, if the text is not aligned to the alphabetic baseline
		(for example, in vertical typesetting styles,
		text is aligned by its central baseline by default [[CSS-WRITING-MODES-4]])
		an underline will cut through descendant text of a larger font-size.
		UA consideration of descendant content will therefore result in better typography.

		<div class="figure">
		  <img src="images/leftline-cross.png" alt="">
		     <img src="images/leftline-under.png" alt="">
		  <p class="caption">
		    Due to the central baseline alignment of vertical text,
		    a left-side underline on small vertical text will cut through the text
		    of a child with a larger font size.
		    The underline is not allowed to be broken,
		    but adjusting its position further to the left
		    properly accommodates all of the underlined text.
		</div>
	</div>

	UAs <em>must</em> adjust line positions
	to match the shifted metrics of <i>decorating boxes</i> shifted
	with 'vertical-align' values other than ''vertical-align/baseline'' [[!CSS2]]
	or subscripted/superscripted via 'font-variant-position' [[!CSS-FONTS-3]],
	but <em>must not</em> adjust the line position or thickness
	in response to descendants of a <i>decorating box</i> that are so styled.
	This allows superscripts and subscripts to be properly decorated
	(underlined, struck through, etc.)
	but prevents them from distorting or breaking the positioning of such decorations on their ancestors.

	<div class="figure">
		<img src="images/underline-superscript.png"
		        alt="An underline for just the superscript 'st' in '1st' is drawn just below the superscript,

		  <style>html { font: 2em Sawasdee; } big { font-size: 2em; }</style>

	</div>

	Some font formats (such as OpenType) can offer information
	about the appropriate position of a line decoration.
	The UA should use such information
	(such as the underline thickness,
	or appropriate alphabetic underline position)
	from the font wherever appropriate.

	Note: Typically, OpenType font metrics give the position
	of an ''text-underline-position/alphabetic'' underline;
	in some cases (especially in CJK fonts),
	it gives the position of a ''under left'' underline.
	(In this case, the font's underline metrics typically
	touch the bottom edge of the em box).
	The UA may but is not required to correct for incorrect font metrics.

<h2 id="emphasis-marks">
Emphasis Marks</h2>

	East Asian documents traditionally use small symbols next to each glyph to emphasize
	a run of text. For example:

	<div class="figure">
		<img alt="Example of emphasis in Japanese appearing over the text"
		     src="images/text-emphasis-ja.png" height="39" width="208">
		<p class="caption">Accent emphasis (shown in blue for clarity) applied to Japanese text
	</div>

	The 'text-emphasis' shorthand, and its 'text-emphasis-style' and 'text-emphasis-color' longhands,
	can be used to apply such marks to the text.
	The 'text-emphasis-position' property, which inherits separately,
	allows setting the emphasis marks’ position with respect to the text.

<h3 id="text-emphasis-style-property">
Emphasis Mark Style: the 'text-emphasis-style' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-emphasis-style
	Value: none | [ [ filled | open ] || [ dot | circle | double-circle | triangle | sesame ] ] | <<string>>
	Initial: none
	Inherited: yes
	Computed value: the keyword ''text-emphasis-style/none'', a pair of keywords representing the shape and fill, or a string
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	This property applies emphasis marks to the element's text.
	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn value for="text-text-emphasis-style">none</dfn>
		<dd>No emphasis marks.

		<dt><dfn value for="text-text-emphasis-style">filled</dfn>
		<dd>The shape is filled with solid color.

	If a shape keyword is specified but neither of ''filled'' nor ''open'' is
	specified, ''filled'' is assumed. If only ''filled'' or ''open'' is specified,
	the shape keyword computes to ''circle'' in horizontal <a>typographic modes</a> and
	''sesame'' in vertical <a>typographic modes</a>.

	The marks should be drawn using the element's font settings
	with the addition of the ''font-variant-east-asian/ruby'' feature
	and the size scaled down 50%.
	However, since not all fonts have all these glyphs,
	and some fonts use inappropriate sizes for emphasis marks in these code points,
	the UA may opt to use a font known to be good for emphasis marks,
	or the marks may instead be synthesized by the UA.
	Marks must remain upright in vertical <a>typographic modes</a>:
	like CJK characters, they do not rotate to match the writing mode.
	The orientation of marks in horizontal <a>typographic modes</a> of vertical <a>writing modes</a>
	is undefined in this level
	(but may be defined in a future level if definitive use cases arise).

	Note: One example of good fonts for emphasis marks is Adobe's open source
	<a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/kenten-generic">Kenten Generic OpenType Font</a>,
	which is specially designed for the emphasis marks.


	The marks are drawn once for each <a>typographic character unit</a>.
	However, emphasis marks are <em>not</em> drawn for:

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#word-separator">Word separators</a>
			or other <a>characters</a> that
			belong to the Unicode separator classes (Z*).
			(But note that emphasis marks <em>are</em> drawn for a space
			 that combines with any combining characters.)

		<li>Punctuation--specifically,
			any <a>characters</a> that belong to the
			Unicode P* <a>general category</a> and
			do not <code>NFKD</code> normalize [[!UAX15]] to
			any of the following symbols:

<h3 id="text-emphasis-color-property">
Emphasis Mark Color: the 'text-emphasis-color' property</h3>

	Name: text-emphasis-color
	Value: <<color>>
	Initial: currentcolor
	Inherited: yes
	Computed value: computed color
	Animation type: by computed value type
	</pre>

	This property specifies the foreground color of the emphasis marks.

	Note: ''currentcolor'' keyword computes to itself
	and is resolved to the value of 'color' after inheritance is performed.
	This means 'text-emphasis-color' by default matches the text 'color'
	even as 'color' changes across elements.

<h3 id="text-emphasis-property">
Emphasis Mark Shorthand: the 'text-emphasis' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef shorthand">
	Name: text-emphasis
	Value: <<'text-emphasis-style'>> || <<'text-emphasis-color'>>
	</pre>

	This property is a shorthand for setting
	'text-emphasis-style' and 'text-emphasis-color'
	in one declaration.
	Omitted values are set to their initial values.

	<p class="note">Note that 'text-emphasis-position' is not reset in this
	shorthand. This is because typically the shape and color vary, but the
	position is consistent for a particular language throughout the document.
	Therefore the position should inherit independently.

<h3 id="text-emphasis-position-property">
Emphasis Mark Position: the 'text-emphasis-position' property</h3>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-emphasis-position
	Value: [ over | under ] && [ right | left ]?
	Initial: over right
	Inherited: yes
	Computed value: specified keyword(s)
	Animation type: discrete
	</pre>

	This property describes where emphasis marks are drawn at.
	If ''[ right | left ]'' is omitted, it defaults to ''text-emphasis-position/right''.
	The values have following meanings:

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn value for="text-text-emphasis-position">over</dfn>
		<dd>Draw marks over the text in horizontal <a>typographic modes</a>.

		<dt><dfn value for="text-text-emphasis-position">under</dfn>

		<dt><dfn value for="text-text-emphasis-position">right</dfn>
		<dd>Draw marks to the right of the text in vertical <a>typographic modes</a>.

		<dt><dfn value for="text-text-emphasis-position">left</dfn>
		<dd>Draw marks to the left of the text in vertical <a>typographic modes</a>.
	</dl>

	Emphasis marks are drawn exactly as if each character was
	assigned the mark as its ruby annotation text with the ruby position
	given by 'text-emphasis-position' and the ruby alignment as centered.
	Note that this position may be adjusted if it would conflict
	with underline or overline decorations.

	The effect of emphasis marks on the line height is the same as for
	ruby text.

	<div class="note">

	If emphasis marks are applied to characters
	for which ruby is drawn in the same position as the emphasis mark,
	the emphasis marks are placed outside the ruby.
	This includes <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ruby-1/#autohide">auto-hidden</a>
	and empty <a>ruby annotations</a>.

	<div class="figure">

		Some editors prefer to hide emphasis marks when they conflict with ruby.

		<pre>ruby { text-emphasis: none; }</pre>
		Some other editors prefer to hide ruby when they conflict with emphasis marks.
		In HTML, this can be done with the following pattern:

<h2 id="text-shadow-property">
Text Shadows: the 'text-shadow' property</h2>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: text-shadow
	Value: none | [ <<color>>? && <<length>>{2,3} ]#
	Initial: none
	Inherited: yes
	Computed value: either the keyword ''box-shadow/none'' or
		a list, each item consisting of three absolute lengths
		plus a computed color
	Animation type: by computed value,

		and appending blank shadows (''transparent 0 0 0'')
		as needed to match the longer list
		if the the shorter list is otherwise compatible with the longer one
	</pre>

	This property accepts a comma-separated list of shadow effects to
	be applied to the text of the element. Values are interpreted as for
	'box-shadow'
	[[!CSS-BACKGROUNDS-3]].
	(But note that spread values and the ''box-shadow/inset'' keyword are not allowed.)
	Each layer shadows the element's text and all its text decorations
	(composited together).
	If the color of the shadow is not specified,
	it defaults to ''currentColor'',
	i.e. the shadow’s color is taken from the element’s 'color' property.

	The shadow effects are applied front-to-back: the first shadow is on
	top. The shadows may thus overlay each other, but they never overlay
	the text itself. The shadow must be painted at a stack level between
	the element's border and/or background, if present, and the elements
	text and text decoration. UAs should avoid painting text shadows over
	text in adjacent elements belonging to the same stack level and stacking
	context. (This may mean that the exact stack level of the shadows depends
	on whether the element has a border or background: the exact stacking
	behavior of text shadows is thus UA-defined.)
	It is undefined whether a given shadow layer shadows
	each glyph or decoration independently
	or if the text and/or decorations are flattened and then shadowed.

	Unlike 'box-shadow', text shadows are not clipped to the shadowed
	shape and may show through if the text is partially-transparent.
	Like 'box-shadow', text shadows do not influence layout, and do not
	trigger scrolling or increase the size of the <a>scrollable overflow region</a>.

	Note: The painting order of shadows defined here is the opposite
	of that defined in the 1998
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512">CSS2 Recommendation</a>.

	The ''text-shadow'' property applies to both the
	<code>::first-line</code> and <code>::first-letter</code>
	pseudo-elements.

<h2 id="painting">
Painting Text Decorations</h2>

<h3 id="painting-order">
Painting Order of Text Decorations</h3>

	As in [[!CSS2]], text decorations are drawn immediately over/under the text they decorate,
	in the following order (bottommost first):

	<ul>
		<li>shadows ('text-shadow')
		<li>underlines ('text-decoration')
		<li>overlines ('text-decoration')
		<li>text
		<li>emphasis marks ('text-emphasis')
		<li>line-through ('text-decoration')
	</ul>


	Where line decorations are drawn across box decorations or atomic inlines,
	they are drawn over non-positioned content and just below any positioned descendants
	(immediately below layer #8 in CSS2.1 Appendix E).

<h3 id="overflow">
Overflow of Text Decorations</h3>

	Text decorations that leak outside a <a>box</a>
	are considered <a>ink overflow</a>:
	they do not extend the <a>scrollable overflow region</a>.
