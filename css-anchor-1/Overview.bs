Anchoring {#anchoring}
==================================

While CSS generally determines the position and size of elements
according to their parents or other ancestors,
[=absolutely positioned=] elements barely participate in their ancestors' layout.
Instead, they're sized and positioned explicitly
by the [=inset properties=] and [=box alignment properties=],
only referencing the final size and position of their [=containing block=].
This provides extreme flexibility,
allowing elements to be positioned more or less arbitrarily,
including over the top of other elements
in ways that the layout methods don't otherwise allow,
but in return it's not very expressive--
the element cannot easily express its size and position
in terms of other elements on the page.

The <dfn export lt="anchor function">anchor functions</dfn>
''anchor()'' and ''anchor-size()'',
defined below,
give back some of the expressivity of ordinary layout
without compromising on the flexibility and power of [=absolute positioning=].
Using these functions,
one can size and position an [=absolutely positioned=] element
relative to one or more [=anchor elements=] on the page.
The ''@position-set'' rule allows even more flexibility,
allowing multiple different sizes/positions to be tried out sequentially
until one is found that fits within the [=containing block=].

Anchor-based Positioning: the ''anchor()'' function {#anchor-pos}
---------------------------------------------------

An [=absolutely-positioned=] element
can use the <dfn>anchor()</dfn> function
as a value in its [=inset properties=]
to refer to the position of one or more [=anchor elements=].
The ''anchor()'' function resolves to a <<length>>.

<pre class=prod>
anchor() = anchor( <<dashed-ident>>? <<anchor-side>>, <<length-percentage>>? )
<dfn><<anchor-side>></dfn> = top | left | right | bottom
			  | start | end | self-start | self-end
			  | <<percentage>> | center
</pre>

The ''anchor()'' function has three arguments:

* the <<dashed-ident>> specifies the [=anchor name=] of the [=anchor element=]
	it will be drawing positioning information from.
	See [=target anchor element=] for details.
	This name is a [=tree-scoped reference=].

	If omitted, the function uses an element's [=implicit anchor element=] instead.

* the <<anchor-side>> value
	refers to the position of the corresponding side
	of the [=target anchor element=].

	The physical <<anchor-side>> keywords
	(<dfn value for=anchor()>left</dfn>,
	<dfn value for=anchor()>right</dfn>,
	<dfn value for=anchor()>top</dfn>,
	and <dfn value for=anchor()>bottom</dfn>)
	are only useful in [=inset properties=]
	corresponding to their corresponding axis:
	for example, using ''top'' and ''bottom'' in 'left' or 'right'
	(or in 'inset-inline-start' if the inline axis is horizontal, etc)
	results in an [=invalid anchor query=].

	The logical <<anchor-side>> keywords
	(<dfn value for=anchor()>start</dfn>,
	<dfn value for=anchor()>end</dfn>,
	<dfn value for=anchor()>self-start</dfn>,
	and <dfn value for=anchor()>self-end</dfn>)
	map to one of the physical keywords
	depending on the property the function is being used in
	(''top'' or ''bottom'' in the 'top' or 'bottom' properties, etc)
	and the [=writing mode=] of either the element
	(for ''self-start'' and ''self-end'')
	or the [=writing mode=] of the element's [=containing block=]
	(for ''start'' and ''end'').

	Issue: Do we need to refer to the anchor element's [=writing mode=]?
	I think that's too unpredictable to actually do anything useful.
	If you're specifying your 'inset-inline-start' property,
	you almost certainly want to refer to an anchor edge
	relative to your own directions,
	not an unpredictable edge based on the anchor.

	A <<percentage>> value refers to a position
	a corresponding percentage between the ''start'' and ''end'' sides,
	with ''0%'' being equivalent to ''start''
	and ''100%'' being equivalent to ''end''.
	The <dfn value for=anchor()>center</dfn> keyword is equivalent to ''50%''.

* the optional <<length-percentage>> final argument is a fallback value.
	If the ''anchor()'' represents an [=invalid anchor query=],
	it resolves to this value
	rather that determining its value as detailed below.

	If omitted,
	it defaults to ''0px''.

An ''anchor()'' function representing a [=valid anchor query=]
resolves to the <<length>>
that would align the edge
of the positioned elements' [=inset-modified containing block=]
corresponding to the property the function appears in
with the specified border edge of the [=target anchor element=],
assuming that all [=scroll containers=]
between the [=target anchor element=]
and the positioned element's [=containing block=]
are scrolled to their initial scroll position
(but see 'anchor-scroll').

If the [=target anchor element=] is [=fragmented=],
the axis-aligned bounding rectangle
of the fragments' border boxes is used instead.

Issue: Do we need to control which box we're referring to,
so you can align to padding or content edge?

If the positioned element
has a [=snapshotted scroll offset=],
then it is additionally visually shifted
by those offsets,
as if by an additional ''translate()'' transform.

<div class=example>
	For example,
	in ''.bar { top: anchor(--foo top); }'',
	the ''anchor()'' will resolve to the length
	that'll line up the <code>.bar</code> element's top edge
	with the ''--foo'' anchor's top edge.

	On the other hand,
	in ''.bar { bottom: anchor(--foo top); }'',
	it will instead resolve to the length
	that'll line up the <code>.bar</code> element's <em>bottom</em> edge
	with the ''--foo'' anchor's top edge.

	Since 'top' and 'bottom' values specify insets from different edges
	(the top and bottom of the element's [=containing block=],
	respectively),
	the same ''anchor()'' will usually resolve to different lengths in each.
</div>

<div class=example>
	Because the ''anchor()'' function resolves to a <<length>>,
	it can be used in [=math functions=] like any other length.

	For example, the following will set up the element
	so that its [=inset-modified containing block=]
	is centered on the [=anchor element=]
	and as wide as possible without overflowing the [=containing block=]:

	<pre highlight=css>
	.centered-message {
		position: fixed;
		max-width: max-content;
		justify-content: center;

		--center: anchor(--x 50%);
		--half-distance: min(
			abs(0% - var(--center)),
			abs(100% - var(--center))
		);
		left: calc(var(--center) - var(--half-distance));
		right: calc(var(--center) - var(--half-distance));
		bottom: anchor(--x top);
	}
	</pre>

	This might be appropriate for an error message
	on an <{input}> element,
	for example,
	as the centering will make it easier to discover
	which input is being referred to.
</div>

Anchor-based Sizing: the ''anchor-size()'' function {#anchor-size}
---------------------------------------------------

An [=absolutely-positioned=] element
can use the <dfn>anchor-size()</dfn> function
in its [=sizing properties=]
to refer to the size of one or more [=anchor elements=].
The ''anchor-size()'' function resolves to a <<length>>.

<pre class=prod>
anchor-size() = anchor( <<dashed-ident>>? <<anchor-size>>, <<length-percentage>>? )
<dfn><<anchor-size>></dfn> = width | height | block | inline | self-block | self-inline
</pre>

The ''anchor-size()'' function is similar to ''anchor()'',
and takes the same arguments,
save that the <<anchor-side>> keywords are replaced with <<anchor-size>>,
referring to the distance between two opposing sides.

The physical <<anchor-size>> keywords
(<dfn value for=anchor-size()>width</dfn>
and <dfn value for=anchor-size()>height</dfn>)
refer to the width and height,
respectively,
of the [=target anchor element=].
Unlike ''anchor()'', there is no restriction on having to match axises;
for example, ''width: anchor-size(--foo height);'' is valid.

The logical <<anchor-size>> keywords
(<dfn value for=anchor-size()>block</dfn>,
<dfn value for=anchor-size()>inline</dfn>,
<dfn value for=anchor-size()>self-block</dfn>,
and <dfn value for=anchor-size()>self-inline</dfn>)
map to one of the physical keywords
according to either the [=writing mode=] of the element
(for ''self-block'' and ''self-inline'')
or the [=writing mode=] of the element's [=containing block=]
(for ''anchor-size()/block'' and ''anchor-size()/inline'').

An ''anchor-size()'' function representing a [=valid anchor query=]
resolves to the <<length>> separating the relevant border edges
(either left and right, or top and bottom,
whichever is in the specified axis)
of the [=target anchor element=].


<!-- Big Text: a-scroll -->

Taking Scroll Into Account: the 'anchor-scroll' property {#scroll}
------------------------------------------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: anchor-scroll
Value: none | <<dashed-ident>>
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Applies to: [=absolutely-positioned=] elements
Animation Type: discrete
</pre>

Because scrolling is often done in a separate thread from layout in implementations for performance reasons,
but ''anchor()'' can result in both positioning changes
(which can be handled in the scrolling thread)
and layout changes
(which cannot),
''anchor()'' is defined to assume
all the [=scroll containers=] between the anchor element
and the positioned element's containing block
are at their initial scroll position.
This means a positioned element
will <em>not</em> be aligned with its anchor
if any of the scrollers are <em>not</em> at their initial positions.

The 'anchor-scroll' property allows an author to compensate for this,
without losing the performance benefits of the separate scrolling thread,
so long as the positioned element
is only anchoring to a single anchor element.
Its values are:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=anchor-scroll>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	:: No effect.

	: <dfn><<dashed-ident>></dfn>
	::
		The scroll offsets of the [=target anchor element=]
		with the name given by the <<dashed-ident>>
		will be compensated for in positioning and fallback.

	: <dfn>implicit</dfn>
	::
		The scroll offsets of the [=implicit anchor element=]
		will be compensated for in positioning and fallback.
</dl>

<div algorithm="compensate for scroll">
	If 'anchor-scroll' is not ''anchor-scroll/none''
	on an [=absolutely-positioned=] element |query el|,
	and there is a [=target anchor element=] for |query el|
	with either the name given by 'anchor-scroll'
	(if its value is a <<dashed-ident>>)
	or no name
	(if its value is ''implicit''),
	and at least one ''anchor()'' function on |query el|
	refers to the same [=target anchor element=],
	then |query el| has a <dfn>snapshotted scroll offset</dfn>,
	which is a pair of lengths
	representing a vertical and horizontal offset.

	The [=snapshotted scroll offset=]
	is the sum of the offsets from the [=initial scroll position=]
	of all [=scroll container=] ancestors of the [=target anchor element=],
	up to but not including |query el|'s [=containing block=].

	Issue: Define the precise timing of the snapshot:
	updated each frame,
	before style recalc.

Determining The Anchor: the 'anchor-name' property {#determining}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: anchor-name
Value: none | <<dashed-ident>>
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Applies to: all elements that generate a [=principal box=]
Animation Type: discrete
</pre>

Values are defined as follows:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=anchor-name>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	:: The property has no effect.

	: <dfn><<dashed-ident>></dfn>
	:: If the element generates a [=principal box=],
		the element is an <dfn dfn for local-lt="anchor">anchor element</dfn>,
		with an <dfn dfn for>anchor name</dfn> equal to the <<dashed-ident>>.
		The [=anchor name=] is a [=tree-scoped name=].

		Otherwise, the property has no effect.
</dl>

The [=anchor functions=]
refer to an [=anchor element=] by name.
That name is not necessarily unique on the page, however;
even if it is, the [=anchor element=] in question
might not be capable of anchoring the positioned element.

<div algorithm>
	To determine the <dfn>target [=anchor element=]</dfn>
	given a querying element |query el|
	and an optional anchor name |name|:

	1. If |name| is not provided:

		1. If |query el| has an [=implicit anchor element=],
			and that element is an [=acceptable anchor element=] for |query el|,
			return that element.

		2. Otherwise, return nothing.

	2. Otherwise, return the first element |el| in tree order
		that satisfies the following conditions:

		* |el| is an [=anchor element=] with an [=anchor name=] of |name|.

		* |el|'s [=anchor name=] and |name| are both associated with the same [=tree=] [=tree/root=].

			Note: The [=anchor name=] is a [=tree-scoped name=],
			while |name| is a [=tree-scoped reference=].

		* |el| is an [=acceptable anchor element=] for |query el|.

		If no element satisfies these conditions,
		return nothing.

	Note: The general rule captured by these conditions
	is that |el| must be fully laid out
	before |query el| is laid out.
	CSS's rules about the layout order of stacking contexts
	give us assurances about this,
	and the list of conditions above
	exactly rephrases the stacking context rules
	into just what's relevant for this purpose,
	ensuring there is no possibly circularity
	in anchor positioning.

	Note: An 'anchor-name' defined by styles in one [=shadow tree=]
	won't be seen by [=anchor functions=] in styles in a different [=shadow tree=],
	preserving encapsulation.
	However, <em>elements</em> in different [=shadow trees=]
	can still anchor to each other,
	so long as both the 'anchor-name' and [=anchor function=]
	come from styles in the same tree,
	such as by using ''::part()'' to style an element inside a shadow.
	([=Implicit anchor elements=] also aren't intrinsically limited to a single tree,
	but the details of that will depend on the API assigning them.)
</div>

<div algorithm>
	An element |el| is a <dfn export>acceptable anchor element</dfn>
	for an [=absolutely positioned=] element |query el|
	if all of the following properties apply:

	* Either |el| is a descendant of |query el|'s [=containing block=],
		or |query el|'s [=containing block=] is the [=initial containing block=].

	* If |el| has the same [=containing block=] as |query el|,
		|el| is not [=absolutely positioned=].

	* If |el| has a different [=containing block=] from |query el|,
		the last [=containing block=] in |el|'s [=containing block chain=]
		before reaching |query el|'s [=containing block=]
		is not [=absolutely positioned=].
</div>

An element can also have an <dfn export>implicit anchor element</dfn>,
used when an [=anchor function=] doesn't specify an explicit [=anchor name=].

Note: The Popup API, for example,
defines an [=implicit anchor element=] for a popup--
the element that the popup is attached to.

Note: An element can have only one implicit anchor element.
If we end up with multiple features defining
potentially different [=implicit anchor elements=] on the same element,
this specification will define a resolution order.

Anchor Queries {#queries}
--------------

The ''anchor()'' and ''anchor-size()'' functions
represent an <dfn>anchor query</dfn>:
a request for the position of one or more sides
of one or more [=anchor elements=].

[=Anchor queries=] are <dfn lt="valid anchor query|invalid anchor query" local-lt="invalid|valid">valid</dfn>
only if all of the following conditions are true:

* Their function is used on an element that is [=absolutely-positioned=].
* If representing an ''anchor()'' function,
	the function is being used in an [=inset property=].
* If representing an ''anchor()'' function
	and the <<anchor-side>> keyword is a physical keyword,
	it's used in an [=inset property=] in the corresponding axis.
* If representing an ''anchor-size()'' function,
	the function is being used in a [=sizing property=].
* There is a [=target anchor element=]
	for the element
	and the [=anchor name=] specified in the function.

Note: As specified in the definition of ''anchor()'',
an [=invalid anchor query=]
causes the function to resolve to its fallback value instead.

Fallback Sizing/Positioning {#fallback}
===========================

Anchor positioning,
while powerful,
can also be unpredictable.
The [=anchor element=] might be anywhere on the page,
so positioning an element in any particular fashion
(such as above the anchor, or the right of the anchor)
might result in the positioned element overflowing its [=containing block=]
or being positioned partially off screen.

To ameliorate this, an [=absolutely positioned=] element
can use the 'position-fallback' property
to refer to a ''@position-fallback'' block,
giving a list of possible style rules to try out.
Each is applied to the element, one by one,
and the first that doesn't cause the element
to overflow its [=containing block=]
is taken as the winner.

The 'position-fallback' Property {#fallback-property}
--------------------------------

<pre class=propdef>
Name: position-fallback
Value: none | <<dashed-ident>>
Initial: none
Inherited: no
Applies to: [=absolutely-positioned=] elements
Animation type: discrete
</pre>

Values have the following meanings:

<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=position-fallback>
	: <dfn>none</dfn>
	:: The property has no effect;
		the element does not use a [=position fallback list=].

	: <dfn><<dashed-ident>></dfn>
	:: If there is a ''@position-fallback'' rule
		with a name matching the specified ident,
		then the element uses that [=position fallback list=].

		Otherwise,
		this value has no effect.
</dl>

The ''@position-fallback'' Rule {#fallback-rule}
-------------------------------

The <dfn>@position-fallback</dfn> rule
defines a [=position fallback list=]
with a given name,
specifying one or more sets of positioning properties
inside of <dfn>@try</dfn> blocks
that will be applied to an element,
with each successive one serving as fallback
if the previous would cause the element
to partially or fully overflow its [=containing block=].

The grammar of the ''@position-fallback'' rule is:

<pre class=prod>
@position-fallback <<dashed-ident>> {
	<<rule-list>>
}

@try { <<declaration-list>> }
</pre>

The ''@position-fallback'' rule only accepts ''@try'' rules.
The <<dashed-ident>> specified in the prelude
is the rule's name.
If multiple ''@position-fallback'' rules are declared with the same name,
the last one in document order "wins".

The ''@try'' rule only accepts the following [=properties=]:

* [=inset properties=]
* [=sizing properties=]
* [=box alignment properties=]

Issue: What exactly are the constraints that determine what's allowed here?
Current list is based off of what's reasonable
from Chrome's experimental impl.
We can make a CQ that keys off of which fallback was used
to allow more general styling,
at least for descendants.

The ''@try'' rules inside a ''@position-fallback''
specify a <dfn>position fallback list</dfn>,
where each entry consists of the properties specified by each ''@try'',
in order.

Issue: If you have a bunch of elements
that all use the same positioning and fallback,
just relative to different anchor elements
(like a bunch of tooltips),
there's no way to have them share @position-fallback rules;
they each need a unique set.
This sucks!
Should figure out some way to address this.

Issue: Would be useful to be able to detect
when your anchor(s) are fully off-screen
and suppress your display entirely.
For example, tooltips living outside the scroller
holding the text they're anchored to
don't want to just hover over arbitrary parts of the page
because their anchor happens to have that position
relative to the scrollport.

Applying Position Fallback {#fallback-apply}
--------------------------

When an element uses a [=position fallback list=],
it selects one entry from the list
as defined below,
and applies those properties to itself as [=used values=].

Note: These have to be applied as used values
because we're in the middle of layout right now;
defining how they'd interact with the cascade
would be extremely confusing *at a minimum*,
and perhaps actually circular.
In any case, not worth the cost in spec or impl.

Issue: This implies that the values can't be transitioned in the usual fashion,
since transitions key off of computed values
and we're past that point.
However, popups sliding between positions is a common effect in UI libs.
Probably should introduce a <css>smooth</css> keyword
to 'position-fallback'
to trigger automatic "animation" of the fallback'd properties.

To determine which entry is selected,
[=list/iterate=] over the [=position fallback list=],
applying the properties of each entry in turn
according to the standard cascade rules,
and additionally shifting the element's [=margin box=]
according to its [=snapshotted scroll offset=]
(if it has one),
and determining whether or not the element's [=margin box=]
overflows its [=containing block=].

Note: Descendants overflowing the anchored block
don't affect this.

The properties of the first non-overflowing entry
(or the last attempted entry, if none succeeded),
are taken as the final values for the specified properties.

Implementations may choose to impose an implementation-defined limit
on the length of [=position fallback lists=],
to limit the amount of excess layout work that may be required.
This limit must be <em>at least</em> five.

<div class=issue>
	Nested anchors
	(an anchored element inside of another anchored element)
	present the potential for exponential blow-up of layouts
	when doing fallback,
	since the grandchild anchored element can cause scrollbars on an ancestor,
	changing the IMCB for the child anchored element,
	thus possibly causing the fallback choice to change for it.

	There are strategies to avoid this,
	but they're not without costs of their own.
	We should <em>probably</em> impose a <strong>maximum</strong> limit as well,
	to avoid this.

	However, since *most* usages won't be problematic in the first place,
	we don't want to restrict them unduly
	just to prevent weird situations from exploding.
	Perhaps a complexity budget based on the branching factor at each level?
	Like, accumulate the product of the fallback list lengths from ancestors,
	and your fallback list gets limited to not exceed a total product
	of, say, 1k.
	Get too deep and you're stuck with your first choice only!
	But this would allow large, complex fallback lists for top-level stuff,
	and even some reasonable nesting.
	(Length-five lists could be nested to depth of 4, for example,
	if we did go with 1k.)

	More thought is needed.

<div class=example>
	For example,
	the following CSS will first attempt to position a "popup"
	below the [=element=],
	but if it doesn't fit on-screen will switch to being above;
	it defaults to left-aligning,
	but will switch to right-aligning if that doesn't fit.

	<pre highlight=css>
	#myPopup {
		position: fixed;
		position-fallback: --button-popup;
		overflow: auto;

		/* The popup is at least as wide as the button */
		min-width: anchor-size(--button width);

		/* The popup is at least as tall as 2 menu items */
		min-height: 6em;
	}

	@position-fallback --button-popup {
		/* First try to align the top, left edge of the popup
		with the bottom, left edge of the button. */
		@try {
			top: anchor(--button bottom);
			left: anchor(--button left);
		}

		/* Next try to align the bottom, left edge of the popup
		with the top, left edge of the button. */
		@try {
			bottom: anchor(--button top);
			left: anchor(--button left);
		}

		/* Next try to align the top, right edge of the popup
		with the bottom, right edge of the button. */
		@try {
			top: anchor(--button bottom);
			right: anchor(--button right);
		}

		/* Finally, try to align the bottom, right edge of the popup
		with the top, right edge of the button. Other positions are possible,
		but this is the final option the author would like the rendering
		engine to try. */
		@try {
			bottom: anchor(--button top);
			right: anchor(--button right);
		}
	}
