      <h1>Long description of example illustrating floating with
clear</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates the effects of floating a box ("inner")
and how its "sibling" is forced below it due to the 'clear' property.

<P>A document window is shown, with 8 lines (numbered 1 to 8), each
24px high. Text before the "inner" box flows on lines 1 and halfway on
line 2. The "inner" box has been floated to the right and occupies the
second half of lines 3 and 4.  The sibling box flows on the following
line (line 4) and is followed by the remainder of the text.

<P>In the following PRE element, each 24 pixel line is simulated by
two lines, the second beginning with the appropriate number. 
Vertical bars represent the left edge of the floated box.
The lines, as they appear in the image, contain:</p>

<PRE>

1 Beginning of body contents. Start 

2 of outer contents.     | Inner

3                        | contents.

4 Sibling contents. End of outer 

5 contents. End of body contents.
</PRE>

<P>The default text color is black.
"Start of outer contents" is red.
"Sibling contents" is red.
"Inner contents" is blue.
"End of outer contents" is red.
