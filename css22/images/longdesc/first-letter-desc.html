      <h1>Long description for drop cap example</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates a drop cap layout using 
the :first-letter pseudo-class.

capital "T" that spans two lines. The rest of the text
flows around the "T": the first two lines lie to its right

<P>In the following PRE element layout, the space occupied
by the "T" at the beginning of the second line is represented
by an underscore (_):</P>
