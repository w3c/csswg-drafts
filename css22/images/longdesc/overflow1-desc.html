      <h1>Long description for example with unclipped overflow</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates how content may overflow a box.

<P>Two boxes are shown. The first one has a red border and is
labeled DIV. The upper left corner of the second box, labeled
BLOCKQUOTE, is positioned in the middle of the DIV box. The
BLOCKQUOTE box has a black dashed border and contains 
the following text, attributed to Groucho Marx:
"I didn't like the play, but then again I saw it
under adverse conditions - the curtain was up." The BLOCKQUOTE
box overflows the DIV box to the right and below it. Since
the 'overflow' property on BLOCKQUOTE is 'visible', the overflowing
text remains visible.
