      <h1>Long description of example illustrating hidden internal
borders</h1>

<P>This diagram shows how the precedence rules may be used
to achieve the effect of hidden internal borders.

<P>The two by two table is surrounded by a solid border. The HTML
table specification and style rules following the image cause the
vertical border between the two cells in the first row and the
horizontal border between the two cells in the first column to
disappear.
