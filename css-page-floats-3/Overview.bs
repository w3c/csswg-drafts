<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  This specification adds new keywords on the 'float' property.

  This document allows to specify whether a <a>float</a> floats to align with a
  <a>float reference</a> inline box, column, region or page. In the case of floats
  with a reference <a>fragmentation container</a>, placement can be deferred to a
  subsequent <a>fragmentation container</a> with the <em>float-defer</em> properties.

  New values on the 'clear' property add further ways of refining layouts.

  The way contents wrap around floats can be controlled by changing the value of
  the 'wrap-flow' property which initially is set to 'both' for page floats.

  <p class="issue">
    Page floats as defined here work with different types of fragmentation types
    (columns, regions, pages) as well as container elements. The specification
    is no longer specific to print or to pages.
    At the same time, inline floats and page floats differ in many ways, and it may
    (or may not) be a good idea to separate the two entirely.
    Therefore, the name <em>CSS Page Floats</em> should probably be replaced with
    a more appropriate name.
  </div>

<h3 id="values">Value Definitions</h3>

  This specification follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS2]]
  using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#value-defs">value definition syntax</a> from [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
  Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Values &amp; Units [[!CSS-VALUES-3]].
  Combination with other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types.

  In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
  all properties defined in this specification
  also accept the <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> as their property value.
  For readability they have not been repeated explicitly.

<h2 id="terms">

        placement takes place.
    <dt><dfn>Float reference</dfn>
    <dd>
      The entity to which the float is aligned.
    <dt><dfn>Not overlapping</dfn>
    <dd>

  </dl>

<h2 id="floating">
Floating to the inline-start/inline-end and block-start/block-end</h2>

  <p>
    Floating elements can float to the start or end of the <a>float anchor</a>'s line or
    block, specified by the 'float' attribute. The floats are aligning to the start
    or end of a <a>float reference</a>, specified by the 'float-reference' attribute. The
    <a>float reference</a> can be the <a>float anchor</a>'s line box, column, region or page.

      The <a>float reference</a> is the line box of the <a>float anchor</a>.

      The <a>float containing block formatting context</a> is the same as that of the
      <a>float anchor</a>.

      The float is an <a>inline float</a>.

    <dt><dfn>column</dfn>
    <dd>
      The <a>float reference</a> is the column in a multi column environment in
      which the <a>float anchor</a> is placed. If the <a>float anchor</a> is not
      inside a column, the <a>float reference</a> is the line box of the <a>float

    <dt><dfn>region</dfn>
    <dd>
      The <a>float reference</a> is the region in a region-chain within which the
      <a>float anchor</a> is placed. If the <a>float anchor</a> is not inside a
      region, the <a>float reference</a> is the line box of the <a>float

  </dl>

  <div class="issue">
    The <a>float containing block formatting context</a> having the same dimensions
    as the <a>float reference</a> means that all floats that are not inline floats
    cannot move outside of their float references. Is this wanted?
  </div>

  <div class="issue">
    It is not possible to specify a block element which element to use as the
    reference element. This has been requested.

    Maybe something like:

    <pre><code>
&lt;style>
.float {
float-reference: float-container;
}

#container {
float-container: true;
}
&lt;/style>

&lt;div id="container">
&lt;p>First paragraph&lt;span class="float">FLOAT&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Second paragraph
&lt;span class="inline-block">[&lt;span class="float">FLOAT&lt;/span>] &lt;/span>
And some more text&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
    </code></pre>

    This should float both floats with reference to the &lt;div id="container">
    element, rather than the &lt;P> and inline &lt;SPAN> elements.

<div class="issue">
  There is currently no way to float into a combination of directions (top right,
  right top, left bottom, bottom left, etc.).
</div>


<div class="example">
  Float figure to top of reference column:

<pre>
.figure { float-reference: column; float: top }
</pre>

  <img alt="sample rendering" src="images/7.png">

<div class="example">
  In this example a block-start float that does not fill the entire <a>inline size</a>
  of the float reference is placed at the start of the block and line.

<pre>
.figure { float-reference: column; float: block-start; width: 50% }
</pre>

  <img alt="sample rendering" src="images/block_line_start.png">
</div>

<div class="example">
  In this example, a figure naturally appears close to a column break. There is
  not enough space for the figure in the first column, and it is therefore placed
  in the second column, leaving white space at the bottom of the first column.

  <img alt="sample rendering" src="images/23.png">

  To avoid the white space, the image can be floated to the nearest edge (in the
  block direction):

<pre>
.figure { float-reference: column; float: snap-block }
</pre>

  In this example, the figure is already at the nearest edge, so it does not
  move. However, floats allow subsequent content to be displayed before the
  float and the white space can therefore be filled:

  <img alt="sample rendering" src="images/7.png">
</div>

<div class="example">

  In this example, two figures naturally appear in the text flow:

  <img alt="sample rendering" src="images/20.png">

  A typographer would typically try to avoid single lines of text above/below
  figures, which can be achieved with:

<pre>
div.figure { float-reference: column; float: snap-block(1.5em) }

  The length value specifies the reach of the snap function; in this example the
  second figure is affected, but not the first.

<h2 id="deferring_floats">Deferring page floats</h2>

  Users can influence the placement of a <a>page float</a> by deferring them to
  another <a>fragmentation container</a> than where the <a>float anchor</a> is
  placed.

  A float that is an <a>inline float</a> cannot be deferred.

  Float deferring assigns an <a>initial float reference</a>, yet float stacking
  can lead page floats being moved to a subsequent <a>fragmentation container</a>
  if their <a>initial float reference</a> lacks the space to host them.

  The 'float-defer' property is introduced to control deferring floats:

        <a>fragmentation container</a> within the given <a>fragmentation context</a> at the time of
        assignment, then N is the order number of the last <a>fragmentation container</a>
        within the given <a>fragmentation context</a>.

        A negative integer value indicates that the <a>initial float reference</a> of
        the page float should be a <a>fragmentation container</a> of the
        <a>fragmentation context</a>, counting backward from the end, so that -1
        is the last <a>fragmentation container</a>, -2 is the next-to-last, etc. .
        In the case of a negative integer value, the <a>initial float reference</a> is the
        Nth <a>fragmentation container</a> of the <a>fragmentation context</a>, where N is 1
        plus the order number of the last <a>fragmentation container</a> within the given
        <a>fragmentation context</a> after all previous page floats have been placed plus
        the value of the `float-defer` property.

        Zero is the same as `none`.

        If the value of the `float-defer` property would cause the <a>initial float
        reference</a> to be an inexistent <a>fragmentation container</a>, the property
        is interpreted as if it were zero.

        <p class="note">
          Negative float-defer values put the initial float reference a certain number
          to be a certain amount of fragmentation containers from the last fragmentation
          container at the time of the placement. Subsequent page float stacking
          can mean that a page float is being placed in a later fragmentation container
          (a page float with float-defer set to -3 can end up being placed in the
          last fragmentation container), and later page floats may mean that new
          fragmentation containers are added, so that the a fragmentation container
          that previously was Nth last fragmentation container within a fragmentation
          context now is the N+Xth last. Additional fragmentation container(s) that
          are added after the page float was placed, will not cause the page float
          to be moved.

      <dt>last
      <dd>
        The <a>initial float reference</a> is the last <a>fragmentation container</a> within

<h2 id="wrapping-around-page-floats">Wrapping around page floats</h2>

  Page floats have their 'wrap-flow' property set to 'both' initially and are
  treated like exclusions. This specification does not make any further
  specification about wrapping contents around page floats.

  <div class="issue">
    Should the 'wrap-flow' really be set to both, or should the flow be restricted
    to only be on one side?

    Inherited: no
    Percentages: see prose

  </pre>

  This property pushes a <a>page float</a> in direction opposite of the where it has been
  floated with 'float'.

  If the element is an <a>inline float</a>, this property is ignored.

  This property can only influence a <a>page float</a> along an axis along which
  it has been floated.

      Percentage values are computed according to this formula:

<h2 id="page-float-placement">Page float placement</h2>

  The order of page floats placement is determined by the following rules:

  <ol>
    <li>
      All page floats with 'float-reference' set to `page` are placed, in
      document order, before those with 'float-reference' set to `region` and
      `column`.
    <li>
      Thereafter, page floats with 'float-reference' set to `column` and `region`
      are placed in document order.
    </li>
  </ol>

  The placement of a single page float is a process that has to be terminated
  entirely before the placement of a subsequent page float can be initiated. The
  placement process consists of the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Determine the <a>initial float reference</a> by considering the
    <a>fragmentation container</a> in which the <a>float anchor</a> is placed and
    the `float-defer` property of the page float. The <a>float reference</a> is
    initially set to be the same as the <a>initial float reference</a>.</li>

    <li>Determine if the given <a>float reference</a> has enough space or can be
    expanded to host the page float, if the rules of <a href="#float-stacking">
    float stacking</a> and <a href="#float-reference-growth">float reference
    growth</a> are to be followed. If this is not the case, and the <a>float
    reference</a> is not the last <a>fragmentation container</a> within the given
    <a>fragmentation context</a>, then make the following <a>fragmentation
    container</a> within the given <a>fragmentation context</a> the <a>float
    reference</a>. Repeat this step until the <a>float reference</a> can be
    expanded enough to host the page float or it is the last <a>fragmentation
    container</a> within the given <a>fragmentation context</a>.</li>

    <li>If the <a>float reference</a> is the last <a>fragmentation container</a> within
    the given <a>fragmentation context</a>, and it has not enough space and cannot be
    expanded to host the page float, then do the following:</li>

    <ol>
      <li>If the <a>fragmentation context</a> allows for the addition of another
      <a>fragmentation container</a> and an additional <a>fragmentation container</a>
      would have the needed size to host the page float, a new <a>fragmentation
      container</a> is added to the end of the <a>fragmentation context</a>. The
      <a>float reference</a> is set the newly created <a>fragmentation
      container</a>.</li>

      <li>Otherwise, if the <a>fragmentation container</a> is a region, then the
      'regionOverset` attribute of the <a>fragmentation container</a> is set to
      `overset`.
    </ol>

    <li>The page float is placed in the <a>float reference</a> according to the rules
    of 'float stacking' and 'float reference growth'.</li>

  </ol>

<h3 id="float-reference-growth">Float reference growth</h3>

Float references can grow up to the their `max-height` and `max-width` or their
`available size`, whichever is the lowest, in order to accommodate page floats.

<h3 id="float-stacking">Rules for page float stacking</h3>

Page floats are stacked within a given <a>float reference</a> in the order of their
placement and in the direction of the inline- and flow-directions of the
<a>fragmentation context</a> while <a>not overlapping</a> with any other page
floats with the same <a>float reference</a> and by keeping a distance N between
the page float's margin edge and the padding edge of the <a>float reference</a>
as well as between the page float's margin edge and the margin edge of the last
previously placed page float with the same <a>float reference</a> and the same
'float' value, where N is the 'float-offset' value of the page float.

For the purpose of calculating whether enough space is available for a page floats
within the <a>float reference</a>, it is assumed that the page floats in the block
directions fill the entire line size of the <a>float reference</a> and page floats
in the inline direction fill the entire block size of the <a>float reference</a>.

For the purpose of placement, page floats in the block-start direction are also
placed at the inline-start edge of the float reference and vice versa, and page
floats in the block-end direction are placed at the inline-end edge of the float
reference and vice versa.

If the page float has a defined 'clear'-value, then the <a>float reference</a> in
which the page float is placed is closed for all subsequent page floats that
floating in the direction specified by the 'clear'-value.

<p class="issue">
  We can effectively currently float to two corners: inline-start/block-start and
  inline-end/block-end. We should augment this with the option to have a secondary
  float direction to allow basic 2D floating.


<h2 id="relation_to_absolutely_positioned_exclusions">
Floats and absolutely positioned exclusions</h2>

Floats and absolutely positioned exclusions share some common traits, but in the
case of inline floats they are not the same. Floats that are not inline floats
should behave the same as absolutely positioned exclusions with positions and
sizes manually set to prevent overlap between floats and to prevent floats from
moving beyond the edges of the float reference, with the float reference being
grown as much as needed up to its maximum extend to accommodate all containing
floats.

<h3 id="inline_floats_and_absolutely_positioned_exclusions">
Differences between inline floats and absolutely positioned elements</h3>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  <p>
    Inline floats and absolutely positioned elements are both out-of-flow elements.
    Absolutely positioned elements that are also exclusions can imitate many of
    the features of floats.

  <p>
    However, in the case of inline floats, the block formatting context that
    contains them (the <a>float containing block formatting context</a>) is
    required to include the area occupied by the float, which is not a requirement
    for absolutely positioned elements.

  <div class="example">
    An inline float inside a <a>float containing block formatting context</a> given
    by a display-inline-block element. The element, which has a green border, is
    expanded to include the brown float.

<pre><code>
&lt;style>
.float {
  float: left;
  margin: 5px;
}
.border {
    border: 3px solid black;
    margin: 5px;
}
#outer {
    border: 1px solid green;
    display: inline-block;
}
canvas {
    background-color: brown;
}
p {
  margin: 5px;
}
&lt;/style>
&lt;div id="outer">
    &lt;p class="border">
        &lt;span class="float border">
            &lt;canvas width="100" height="100"/>
        &lt;/span>
        First paragraph.
    &lt;/p>
    &lt;p class="border">
        Second paragraph and some more text.
    &lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
</code></pre>

    <img alt="sample rendering" src="images/float_containing_context.png">

    In comparison, the below is the same HTML, but the float is replaced by an
    absolutely positioned element that is also an exclusion. The <a>float
    containing block formatting context</a> is still given by a
    display-inline-block element. However, the element, marked by a green border,
    does not expand to include the brown, absolutely positioned element.

<pre><code>
&lt;style>
.float {
    position: absolute;
    top: 8px;
    left: 8px;
    wrap-flow: both;
}
.border {
    border: 3px solid black;
    margin: 5px;
}
#outer {
    border: 1px solid green;
    display: inline-block;
    position: relative;
}
canvas {
    background-color: brown;
}
&lt;/style>
&lt;div id="outer">
    &lt;p class="border">
        &lt;span class="float border">
            &lt;canvas width="100" height="100"/>
        &lt;/span>
        First paragraph.
    &lt;/p>
    &lt;p class="border">
        Second paragraph and some more text.

<h2 id="overconstrained-page-floats">Overconstrained floats</h2>

  In many cases, the specified values on these properties cannot be honored.

  <div class="example">

    The number of columns is limited, and high values therefore cannot be honored:

<pre>
.figure { float-reference: column; float: top; float-defer: 1000 }
</pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    A narrow screen may only have room for one column, in which case this request
    cannot be honored:

<pre>
.figure { float-reference: column; float: top; float-defer: -5 }
</pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    In long documents, all content cannot fit on the last page, and this rule
    therefore cannot be honored:

<pre>
p { float-reference: page; float: top; float-defer: last }
</pre>

  </div>

  Floats are processed in the order they appear in the source. However, the
  visual order of floats may not be the same as the source order.

  <div class="example">
    Consider this code:

<pre>
.one { float-reference: page; float: top; float-defer: last }
.two { float-reference: column; float: top; clear: column }

&lt;div class=one>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class=two>&lt;/div>
</pre>

    In this example, the first element requests to appear on the last page, while
    the second element requests to appear in the natural column. If the natural
    column of the second element appears on a page before the last page, the second
    element will appear visually before the first.

  </div>


  <div class="example">

    Consider this code:

<pre>
.one { float-reference: page; float: top; float-defer: last }
.two { float-reference: page; float: top; clear: page; }

&lt;div class=one>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class=two>&lt;/div>
</pre>

    If all content can fit on one page, the first page will also be the last page.
    The first element is processed first and is placed on top of the first page.
    Then the second element is processed. It requests a clear top, something which is
    not possible on the first page. Therefore, a second page is created and the
    first element is moved there. Even if the first element requests to be on the
    last page, it will not appear there.

  </div>

  When resolving over-constrained layouts, the order of importance for defined
  goals are:

  <ol>
    <li>honor 'clear: top/bottom'
    <li>honor 'float-defer'
    <li>honor 'float: top/bottom'
    <li>display all content (as described by other CSS properties)
    <li>keep the number of pages to a minimum
  </ol>
