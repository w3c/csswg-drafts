<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	The value definition field of each CSS property can contain keywords,
	data types (which appear between <css>&lt;</css> and <css>></css>), and information on how
	they can be combined.
	Generic data types (<<length>> being the most widely used)
	that can be used by many properties are described in this specification,
	while more specific data types (e.g., <<spacing-limit>>)
	are described in the corresponding modules.

<h3 id="placement">
Module Interactions</h3>

	This module replaces and extends the data type definitions in [[!CSS21]]
	sections

	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#values">4.3</a>,

<h2 id="value-defs">
Value Definition Syntax</h2>

	The <dfn for=CSS export>value definition syntax</dfn> described here
	is used to define the set of valid values for CSS properties
	(and the valid syntax of many other parts of CSS).
	A value so described can have one or more components.

<h3 id="component-types">
Component Value Types</h3>

	Component value types are designated in several ways:

	<ol>
		<li>
			<a href="#keywords">keyword</a> values (such as <css>auto</css>, ''disc'', etc.),
			which appear literally, without quotes (e.g. <code>auto</code>)

		<li>
			basic data types, which appear between <css>&lt;</css> and <css>></css>
			(e.g., <<length>>, <<percentage>>, etc.).
			For <a>numeric data types</a>,
			this type notation can annotate any range restrictions
			using the [[#numeric-ranges|bracketed range notation]] described below.

		<li>
			types that have the same range of values as a property bearing the same name
			(e.g., <<'border-width'>>, <<'background-attachment'>>, etc.).
			In this case, the type name is the property name (complete with quotes) between the brackets.
			Such a type does <em>not</em> include <a href="#common-keywords">CSS-wide keywords</a> such as ''inherit'',
			and also does not include any top-level <a href="#mult-comma">comma-separated-list multiplier</a>
			(i.e. if a property named <css>pairing</css> is defined as <css>[ <<custom-ident>> <<integer>>? ]#</css>,
			then \<<\'pairing'>> is equivalent to <css>[ <<custom-ident>> <<integer>>? ]</css>,
			not <css><<custom-ident>> <<integer>> ]#</css>).

		<li>
			non-terminals that do not share the same name as a property.
			In this case, the non-terminal name appears between <css>&lt;</css> and <css>></css>,
			as in <<spacing-limit>>.
			Notice the distinction between <<border-width>> and <<'border-width'>>:
			the latter is defined as the value of the 'border-width' property,
			the former requires an explicit expansion elsewhere.
			The definition of a non-terminal is typically located near its first appearance in the specification.
	</ol>


	Some property value definitions also include the slash (/),
	the comma (,),
	and/or parentheses as literals.
	These represent their corresponding tokens.
	Other non-keyword literal characters that may appear in a component value,
	such as “+”,
	must be written enclosed in single quotes.

	<strong><dfn lt="," id='comb-comma' export grammar>Commas</dfn> specified in the grammar are implicitly omissible</strong> in some circumstances,
	when used to separate optional terms in the grammar.
	Within a top-level list in a property or other CSS value,
	or a function's argument list,
	a comma specified in the grammar must be omitted if:

	<ul>
		<li>
			all items preceding the comma have been omitted

		<li>
			all items following the comma have been omitted

		<li>
			multiple commas would be adjacent (ignoring <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace">white space</a>/comments),
			due to the items between the commas being omitted.
	</ul>

	<div class='example'>
		For example, if a function can accept three arguments in order,
		but all of them are optional,
		the grammar can be written like:

		<pre class='prod'>
		example( first? , second? , third? )
		</pre>

		Given this grammar,
		writing ''example(first, second, third)'' is valid,
		as is ''example(first, second)'' or ''example(first, third)'' or ''example(second)''.
		However, ''example(first, , third)'' is invalid, as one of those commas are no longer separating two options;
		similarly, ''example(,second)'' and ''example(first,)'' are invalid.
		''example(first second)'' is also invalid,
		as commas are still required to actually separate the options.

		If commas were not implicitly omittable,
		the grammar would have to be much more complicated
		to properly express the ways that the arguments can be omitted,
		greatly obscuring the simplicity of the feature.
	</div>

	All CSS properties also accept the <a href="#common-keywords">CSS-wide keyword values</a>
	as the sole component of their property value.
	For readability these are not listed explicitly in the property value syntax definitions.
	For example, the full value definition of 'border-color'
	is <code>&lt;color>{1,4} | inherit | initial | unset</code>
	(even though it is listed as <code>&lt;color>{1,4}</code>).

	Note: This implies that, in general,
	combining these keywords with other component values in the same declaration
	results in an invalid declaration.
	For example,
	''background: url(corner.png) no-repeat, inherit;'' is invalid.

<h3 id="component-combinators">
Component Value Combinators</h3>

	Component values can be arranged into property values as follows:

	<ul export dfn-type="grammar">
		<li>Juxtaposing components means that
			all of them must occur, in the given order.
		<li>A double ampersand (<dfn id='comb-all'>&&</dfn>) separates two or more components,
			all of which must occur, in any order.
		<li>A double bar (<dfn id='comb-any'>||</dfn>) separates two or more options:
			one or more of them must occur, in any order.
		<li>A bar (<dfn id='comb-one'>|</dfn>) separates two or more alternatives:
			exactly one of them must occur.
		<li>Brackets ([&nbsp;]) are for grouping.
	</ul>

	Juxtaposition is stronger than the double ampersand, the double
	ampersand is stronger than the double bar, and the double bar
	is stronger than the bar. Thus, the following lines are equivalent:

	<pre>
	  a b   |   c ||   d &&   e f
	[ a b ] | [ c || [ d && [ e f ]]]
	</pre>

	For reorderable combinators (||, &&),
	ordering of the grammar does not matter:
	components in the same grouping may be interleaved in any order.
	Thus, the following lines are equivalent:

	<pre>
	a || b || c
	b || a || c
	</pre>

<h3 id="component-multipliers">
Component Value Multipliers</h3>

	Every type, keyword, or bracketed group may be followed by one of
	the following modifiers:

	<ul export dfn-type="grammar">
		<li>An asterisk (<dfn id='mult-zero-plus'>*</dfn>) indicates that the preceding type, word, or
			group occurs zero or more times.

		<li>A plus (<dfn id='mult-one-plus'>+</dfn>) indicates that the preceding type, word, or group
			occurs one or more times.

		<li>A question mark (<dfn id='mult-opt'>?</dfn>) indicates that the preceding type, word, or
			group is optional (occurs zero or one times).

		<li>A single number in curly braces (<dfn id='mult-num'>{<var>A</var>}</dfn>)
			indicates that the preceding type, word, or group occurs <var>A</var> times.

		<li>A comma-separated pair of numbers in curly braces (<dfn id='mult-num-range'>{<var>A</var>,<var>B</var>}</dfn>)
			indicates that the preceding type, word, or group occurs at least
			<var>A</var> and at most <var>B</var> times.
			The <var>B</var> may be omitted ({<var>A</var>,})
			to indicate that there must be at least <var>A</var> repetitions,
			with no upper bound on the number of repetitions.

		<li>A hash mark (<dfn id='mult-comma'>#</dfn>) indicates that the preceding type, word, or
			group occurs one or more times, separated by comma tokens
			(which may optionally be surrounded by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace">white space</a> and/or comments).
			It may optionally be followed by the curly brace forms, above,
			to indicate precisely how many times the repetition occurs,
			like ''&lt;length>#{1,4}''.

		<li>An exclamation point (<dfn id='mult-req'>!</dfn>) after a group indicates that the group is required
			and must produce at least one value;
			even if the grammar of the items within the group would otherwise allow the entire contents to be omitted,
			at least one component value must not be omitted.
	</ul>

	For repeated component values (indicated by <css>*</css>, <css>+</css>, or <css>#</css>),
	UAs must support at least 20 repetitions of the component.
	If a property value contains more than the supported number of repetitions,
	the declaration must be ignored as if it were invalid.

<h3 id='combinator-multiplier-patterns'>
Combinator and Multiplier Patterns</h3>

	There are a small set of common ways to combine multiple independent <a>component values</a> in particular numbers and orders.
	In particular, it's common to want to express that,
	from a set of component value,
	the author must select zero or more, one or more, or all of them,
	and in either the order specified in the grammar or in any order.

	All of these can be easily expressed using simple patterns of <a href="#component-combinators">combinators</a> and <a href="#component-multipliers">multipliers</a>:

	<table class='data'>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>
				<th>in order
				<th>any order
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>zero or more
				<td><code>A? B? C?</code>
				<td><code>A? || B? || C?</code>

			<tr>
				<th>one or more
				<td><code>[ A? B? C? ]!</code>
				<td><code>A || B || C</code>

			<tr>
				<th>all
				<td><code>A B C </code>
				<td><code>A && B && C</code>
	</table>

	Note that all of the "any order" possibilities are expressed using combinators,
	while the "in order" possibilities are all variants on juxtaposition.

<h3 id="component-whitespace">
Component Values and White Space</h3>

	Unless otherwise specified,
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace">white space</a> and/or comments may appear before, after, and/or between
	components combined using the above
	<a href="#component-combinators">combinators</a> and
	<a href="#component-multipliers">multipliers</a>.

	Note: In many cases, spaces will in fact be <em>required</em> between components
	in order to distinguish them from each other.
	For example, the value ''1em2em'' would be parsed as a single <<dimension-token>>
	with the number ''1'' and the identifier ''em2em'',
	which is an invalid unit.
	In this case, a space would be required before the ''2''
	to get this parsed as the two lengths ''1em'' and ''2em''.

<h3 id="value-examples">
Property Value Examples</h3>

	Below are some examples of properties with their corresponding value
	definition fields

	<div class=example>
		<table class="data" id="propvalues">

<h2 id="combining-values">
Combining Values: Interpolation, Addition, and Accumulation</h2>

	Some procedures, for example
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transitions/">transitions</a>
	and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-animations/">animations</a>,
	<dfn export>combine</dfn> two CSS property values.
	The following combining operations--
	on the two <a>computed values</a> <var>V<sub>a</sub></var> and <var>V<sub>B</sub></var>
	yielding the <a>computed value</a> <var>V<sub>result</sub></var>--
	are defined:

	<dl export>
		<dt><dfn id="interpolation" lt="interpolation | interpolate | value interpolation | interpolation procedure">interpolation</dfn>
		<dd>
			Given two property values
			<var>V<sub>a</sub></var> and <var>V<sub>B</sub></var>,
			produces an intermediate value
			<var>V<sub>result</sub></var>
			at a distance of <var>p</var>
			along the interval between
			<var>V<sub>a</sub></var> and <var>V<sub>B</sub></var>
			such that <var>p</var> = 0 produces <var>V<sub>a</sub></var>
			and <var>p</var> = 1 produces <var>V</var><sub>B</sub>.

			The range of <var>p</var> is (&minus;&infin;, &infin;)
			due to the effect of <a>timing functions</a>.
			As a result, this procedure must also define
			extrapolation behavior for <var>p</var> outside [0, 1].

		<dt><dfn id="addition" lt="value addition | addition procedure" local-lt="add | addition">addition</dfn>
		<dd>
			Given two property values
			<var>V<sub>a</sub></var> and <var>V<sub>B</sub></var>,
			returns the sum of the two properties,
			<var>V</var><sub>result</sub>.
			For addition that is not commutative
			(for example, matrix multiplication)
			<var>V<sub>a</sub></var> represents
			the first term of the operation and
			<var>V<sub>B</sub></var> represents
			the second.

			Note: While <a>addition</a>
			can often be expressed
			in terms of the same weighted sum function
			used to define <a>interpolation</a>,
			this is not always the case.
			For example, interpolation of transform matrices involves
			decomposing and interpolating the matrix components
			whilst addition relies on matrix multiplication.

		<dt><dfn id="accumulation" lt="value accumulation | accumulation procedure" local-lt="accumulate | accumulation">accumulation</dfn>
		<dd>
			Given two property values
			<var>V<sub>a</sub></var> and <var>V<sub>B</sub></var>,
			returns the result, <var>V<sub>result</sub></var>,
			of combining the two operands
			such that <var>V<sub>B</sub></var>
			is treated as a <em>delta</em> from <var>V<sub>a</sub></var>.
			For accumulation that is not commutative
			(for example, accumulation of mismatched transform lists)
			<var>V<sub>a</sub></var> represents the first term of the operation
			and <var>V<sub>B</sub></var> represents the second.

			<div class="note">
				Note: For many types of animation such as numbers or lengths,
				<a>accumulation</a> is defined to be identical
				to <a>addition</a>.

				A common case where the definitions differ
				is for list-based types
				where <a>addition</a> may be defined as appending to a list
				whilst <a>accumulation</a> may be defined
				as component-based addition.
				For example, the filter list values ''blur(2)'' and ''blur(3)'',
				when <a>added</a> together would produce ''blur(2) blur(3)'',
				but when <a>accumulated</a> would produce ''blur(5)''.
			</div>
	</dl>

	These operations are only defined on <a>computed values</a>.
	(As a result, it is not necessary to define, for example,
	how to add a <<length>> value of ''15pt'' with ''5em''
	since such values will be resolved to their <a>canonical unit</a>
	before being passed to any of the above procedures.)

	If a value type does not define a specific procedure for <a>addition</a>
	or is defined as <dfn export>not additive</dfn>,
	its <a>addition</a> operation is simply
	<var>V<sub>result</sub></var> = <var>V<sub>a</sub></var>.

	If a value types does not define a specific procedure for <a>accumulation</a>,
	its <a>accumulation</a> operation is identical to <a>addition</a>.

<h2 id="textual-values">
Textual Data Types</h2>

	The <dfn export for=CSS>textual data types</dfn> include
	various keywords and identifiers
	as well as strings (<<string>>) and URLs (<<url>>).
	Aside from the casing of <a href="#keywords">pre-defined keywords</a>
	or as explicitly defined for a given property,
	no normalization is performed,
	not even Unicode normalization:
	the <a lt="specified value">specified</a> and <a>computed value</a> of a property
	are exactly the provided Unicode values after parsing
	(which includes character set conversion and [[css-syntax-3#escaping|escaping]]).
	[[!UNICODE]] [[!CSS3SYN]]

	<dfn export lt="CSS identifier | CSS ident | identifier | ident">CSS identifiers</dfn>,
	generically denoted by <dfn>&lt;ident></dfn>,
	consist of a sequence of characters conforming to the <<ident-token>> grammar. [[!CSS3SYN]]
	Identifiers cannot be quoted;
	otherwise they would be interpreted as strings.
	CSS properties accept two classes of <a>identifiers</a>:
	[[#keywords|pre-defined keywords]]
	and [[#custom-idents|author-defined identifiers]].

	Note: The <<ident>> production is not meant for property value definitions--
	<<custom-ident>> should be used instead.
	It is provided as a convenience for defining other syntactic constructs.

	All textual data types <a>interpolate</a> as <a>discrete</a>
	and are <a>not additive</a>.

<h3 id="keywords">
Pre-defined Keywords</h3>

	In the value definition fields,
	<dfn lt="keyword" export>keywords</dfn> with a pre-defined meaning appear literally.
	Keywords are <a>CSS identifiers</a>
	and are interpreted <a lt="ASCII case-insensitive">ASCII case-insensitively</a>
	(i.e., [a-z] and \[A-Z] are equivalent).

	<div class="example">
		For example, here is the value definition for the 'border-collapse'
		property:

		<pre>Value: collapse | separate</pre>

		And here is an example of its use:

		<pre>table { border-collapse: separate }</pre>
	</div>

<h4 id="common-keywords">
CSS-wide keywords: ''initial'', ''inherit'' and ''unset''</h4>

	As defined <a href="#component-types">above</a>,
	all properties accept the <dfn export>CSS-wide keywords</dfn>,
	which represent value computations common to all CSS properties.

	The ''initial'' keyword represents the value specified as the property's initial value.
	The ''inherit'' keyword represents the computed value of the property on the element's parent.
	The ''unset'' keyword acts as either ''inherit'' or ''initial'',
	depending on whether the property is inherited or not.
	All of these keywords are normatively defined in the Cascade module. [[!CSS3CASCADE]]

	Other CSS specifications can define additional CSS-wide keywords.

	<!-- Make it easier to add CSS-wide keywords by defining a grammar production. -->

<h3 id='custom-idents'>
Author-defined Identifiers: the <<custom-ident>> type</h3>

	Some properties accept arbitrary author-defined identifiers as a component value.
	This generic data type is denoted by <dfn id="identifier-value">&lt;custom-ident></dfn>,
	and represents any valid CSS <a>identifier</a>
	that would not be misinterpreted as a pre-defined keyword in that property's value definition.
	Such identifiers are fully [=case-sensitive=]
	(meaning they're compared by codepoint),
	even in the ASCII range
	(e.g. ''example'' and ''EXAMPLE'' are two different, unrelated user-defined identifiers).

	The <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> are not valid <<custom-ident>>s.
	The ''default'' keyword is reserved
	and is also not a valid <<custom-ident>>.
	Specifications using <<custom-ident>> must specify clearly
	what other keywords are excluded from <<custom-ident>>, if any--
	for example by saying that any pre-defined keywords in that property's value definition are excluded.
	Excluded keywords are excluded in all <a lt="ASCII case-insensitive">ASCII case permutations</a>.

	When parsing positionally-ambiguous keywords in a property value,
	a <<custom-ident>> production can only claim the keyword if no other unfulfilled production can claim it.

	<div class="example">
		For example, the shorthand declaration ''animation: ease-in ease-out''
		is equivalent to the longhand declarations
		''animation-timing-function: ease-in; animation-name: ease-out;''.
		''ease-in'' is claimed by the <<easing-function>> production belonging to 'animation-timing-function',
		leaving ''ease-out'' to be claimed by the <<custom-ident>> production belonging to 'animation-name'.
	</div>

	Note: When designing grammars with <<custom-ident>>,
	the <<custom-ident>> should always be "positionally unambiguous",
	so that it's impossible to conflict with any keyword values in the property.

<h3 id="strings">
Quoted Strings: the <<string>> type</h3>

	<dfn export lt="string">Strings</dfn> are denoted by <dfn id="string-value">&lt;string></dfn>
	and consist of a sequence of characters delimited by double quotes or
	single quotes. They correspond to the <<string-token>> production
	in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/">CSS Syntax Module</a> [[!CSS3SYN]].

	<div class=example>
		Double quotes cannot occur inside double quotes, unless
		<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#escaped-characters">escaped</a>
		(as <code>"\""</code> or as <code>"\22"</code>).
		Analogously for single quotes (<code>&#39;\&#39;&#39;</code> or <code>&#39;\27&#39;</code>).

		<pre>
		content: "this is a &#39;string&#39;.";
		content: "this is a \"string\".";
		content: &#39;this is a "string".&#39;;
		content: &#39;this is a \&#39;string\&#39;.&#39;
		</pre>
	</div>

	It is possible to break strings over several lines, for aesthetic or
	other reasons, but in such a case the newline itself has to be escaped
	with a backslash (\). The newline is subsequently removed from the
	string. For instance, the following two selectors are exactly the
	same:

	<div class="example">
		<p style="display:none">Example(s):
		<pre>
		a[title="a not s\
		o very long title"] {/*...*/}
		a[title="a not so very long title"] {/*...*/}
		</pre>
	</div>

	Since a string cannot directly represent a newline, to include a
	newline in a string, use the escape "\A". (Hexadecimal A is the line
	feed character in Unicode (U+000A), but represents the generic notion
	of "newline" in CSS.)

<h3 id="urls">
Resource Locators: the <<url>> type</h3>

	The <dfn>url()</dfn> <a>functional notation</a>,
	denoted by <<url>>,
	represents a <l spec=url>[=/URL=]</l>,
	which is a pointer to a resource.
	The typical syntax of a <<url>> is:

	<pre class="prod"><dfn id="url-value">&lt;url></dfn> = url( <<string>> <<url-modifier>>* )</pre>

	<div class="example">
		Below is an example of a URL being used as a background image:

		<pre>body { background: url("http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif") }</pre>
	</div>

	A <<url>> may alternately be written without quotation marks around the URL itself,
	in which case it is <a lt="consume a url token" spec=css-syntax-3>specially-parsed</a>
	as a <<url-token>> [[!CSS3SYN]].

	<div class="example">
		For example, the following declarations are identical:
		<pre>
			background: url("http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif");
			background: url(http://www.example.com/pinkish.gif);
		</pre>
	</div>

	Note: This unquoted syntax cannot accept a <<url-modifier>> argument
	and has extra escaping requirements:
	parentheses, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace">whitespace</a> characters,
	single quotes (&#39;) and double quotes (") appearing in a URL
	must be escaped with a backslash,
	e.g. ''url(open\(parens)'', ''url(close\)parens)''.
	(In quoted <<string>> ''url()''s,
	only newlines and the character used to quote the string need to be escaped.)
	Depending on the type of URL,
	it might also be possible to write these characters as URL-escapes
	(e.g. ''url(open%28parens)'' or ''url(close%29parens)'')
	as described in [[URL]].

	Some CSS contexts (such as ''@import'') also allow a <<url>>
	to be represented by a bare <<string>>, without the ''url()'' wrapper.
	In such cases the string behaves identically to a ''url()'' function containing that string.

	<div class="example">
		For example, the following statements are identical:
		<pre>
			@import url("base-theme.css");
			@import "base-theme.css";
		</pre>
	</div>

<h4 id="relative-urls">
Relative URLs</h4>

	In order to create modular style sheets that are not dependent on
	the absolute location of a resource, authors should use relative URLs.
	Relative URLs (as defined in [[!URL]]) are resolved to full URLs
	using a base URL. RFC&nbsp;3986, section&nbsp;3, defines the normative
	algorithm for this process.
	For CSS style sheets, the base URL is that of the style sheet itself,
	not that of the styled source document.
	Style sheets embedded within a document have
	the base URL associated with their container.

	When a <<url>> appears in the computed value of a property,
	it is resolved to an absolute URL,
	as described in the preceding paragraph.
	The computed value of a URL that the UA cannot resolve to an absolute URL is the specified value.

	<div class="example">
		For example, suppose the following rule:

		<pre>body { background: url("tile.png") }</pre>

		is located in a style sheet designated by the URL:

		<pre>http://www.example.org/style/basic.css</pre>

		The background of the source document's <code>&lt;body></code>
		will be tiled with whatever image is described by the resource designated by the URL:

		<pre>http://www.example.org/style/tile.png</pre>

		The same image will be used regardless of the URL of the source document containing the <code>&lt;body></code>.
	</div>

<h5 id='local-urls'>
Fragment URLs</h5>

	To work around some common eccentriticites in browser URL handling,
	CSS has special behavior for fragment-only urls.

	If a ''url()''’s value starts with a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (<code>#</code>) character,
	parse it as per normal for URLs,
	but additionally set the <dfn export for="url()">local url flag</dfn> of the ''url()''.

	When matching a ''url()'' with the <a>local url flag</a> set,
	ignore everything but the URL's fragment,
	and resolve that fragment against the current document that relative URLs are resolved against.
	This reference must always be treated as same-document
	(rather than cross-document).

	When <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/#serializing-css-values">serializing</a>
	a ''url()'' with the <a>local url flag</a> set,
	it must serialize as just the fragment.

	<details class=note>
		<summary>What “browser eccentricities”?</summary>

		Theoretically, browsers should re-resolve any relative URLs,
		including fragment-only URLs,
		whenever the document's base URL changes
		(such as through mutation of the <{base}> element,
		or calling {{History/pushState()}}).
		In many cases they don't, however,
		and so without special handling,
		fragment-only URLs will suddenly become cross-document references
		(pointing at the previous base URL)
		and break in many of the places they're used.

		Since fragment-only URLs express a clear semantic
		of wanting to refer to the current document
		regardless of what its current URL is,
		this hack preserves the expected behavior at least in these cases.
	</details>

<h4 id="url-empty">
Empty URLs</h4>

	If the value of the ''url()'' is the empty string
	(like ''url("")'' or ''url()''),
	the url must resolve to an invalid resource
	(similar to what the url ''about:invalid'' does).

	Note: This matches the behavior of empty urls for embedded resources elsewhere in the web platform,
	and avoids excess traffic re-requesting the stylesheet or host document
	due to editting mistakes leaving the ''url()'' value empty,
	which are almost certain to be invalid resources for whatever the ''url()'' shows up in.
	Linking on the web platform <em>does</em> allow empty urls,
	so if/when CSS gains some functionality to control hyperlinks,
	this restriction can be relaxed in those contexts.

<h4 id='url-modifiers'>
URL Modifiers</h4>

	The ''url()'' function supports specifying additional <dfn>&lt;url-modifier></dfn>s,
	which change the meaning or the interpretation of the URL somehow.
	A <<url-modifier>> is either an <<ident>> or a <a>functional notation</a>.

	This specification does not define any <<url-modifier>>s,
	but other specs may do so.

	Note: A <<url>> that is either unquoted or not wrapped in ''url()'' notation
	cannot accept any <<url-modifier>>s.

<h2 id="numeric-types">
Numeric Data Types</h2>

	Numeric data types are used to represent
	quantities, indexes, positions, and other such values.
	Although many syntactic variations can exist
	in expressing the quantity (numeric aspect) in a given numeric value,
	the <a lt="specified value">specified</a> and <a>computed value</a>
	do not distinguish these variations:
	they represent the value’s abstract quantity,
	not its syntactic representation.

	The <dfn>numeric data types</dfn> include
	<<integer>>,
	<<number>>,
	<<percentage>>,
	and various <a>dimensions</a>
	including <<length>>, <<angle>>, <<time>>, <<frequency>>, and <<resolution>>.

	Note: While general-purpose <a>dimensions</a> are defined here,
	some other modules define additional data types
	(e.g. [[css-grid-1]] introduces ''fr'' units)
	whose usage is more localized.

<h3 id="numeric-ranges">
Range Restrictions and Range Definition Notation</h3>

	Properties can restrict numeric values to some range.
	If the value is outside the allowed range,
	then unless otherwise specified,
	the declaration is invalid and must be <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignored</a>.
	Range restrictions can be annotated in the numeric type notation
	using <dfn local-lt="bracketed range notation">CSS bracketed range notation</dfn>--
	<code>[<var>min</var>,<var>max</var>]</code>--
	within the angle brackets, after the identifying keyword,
	indicating a closed range
	between (and including) <var>min</var> and <var>max</var>.
	For example, <<integer [0,10]>> indicates an integer between ''0'' and ''10'', inclusive.

	Note: CSS values generally do not allow open ranges;
	thus only square-bracket notation is used.

	CSS theoretically supports infinite precision and infinite ranges for all value types;
	however in reality implementations have finite capacity.
	UAs should support reasonably useful ranges and precisions.
	Range extremes that are ideally unlimited
	are indicated using &infin; or &minus;&infin; as appropriate.

	If no range is indicated,
	either by using the <a>bracketed range notation</a>
	or in the property description,
	then <code>[&minus;&infin;,&infin;]</code> is assumed.

	Note: At the time of writing,
	the <a>bracketed range notation</a> is new;
	thus in most CSS specifications
	any range limitations are described only in prose.
	(For example, “Negative values are not allowed” or
	“Negative values are invalid”
	indicate a <code>[0,&infin;]</code> range.)
	This does not make them any less binding.

<!--
	The recommended minimum ranges and precision,
	and the required rounding and clamping rules,
	are given in <a href="#required-ranges">Appendix A</a>.

	Number values are denoted by <dfn id="number-value">&lt;number></dfn>,
	and represent real numbers, possibly with a fractional component.

	When written literally,
	a <dfn export>number</dfn> is either an <a>integer</a>,
	or zero or more decimal digits followed by a dot (.) followed by one or more decimal digits
	and optionally an exponent composed of "e" or "E" and an integer.

	As with integers, the first character of a number may be immediately preceded by <css>-</css> or <css>+</css>
	to indicate the number's sign.

	The value <dfn id=zero-value>&lt;zero></dfn> represents a literal <a>number</a>

	When written literally,
	a <a>dimension</a> is a <a>number</a>

	which is an <a>identifier</a>.
	It corresponds to the <<dimension-token>> production
	in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/">CSS Syntax Module</a> [[!CSS3SYN]].
	Like keywords, unit identifiers are <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a>.

	<wpt>

	the following convenience notations may be used in the property grammar:

	: <dfn>&lt;length-percentage></dfn>
	:: Equivalent to <code class=prod>[ <<length>> | <<percentage>> ]</code>,
		where the <<percentage>> will resolve to a <<length>>.
	: <dfn>&lt;frequency-percentage></dfn>

		where the <<percentage>> will resolve to an <<angle>>.
	: <dfn>&lt;time-percentage></dfn>
	:: Equivalent to <code class=prod>[ <<time>> | <<percentage>> ]</code>,
		where the <<percentage>> will resolve to a <<time>>.

	<div class="example">
		For example, the 'width' property can accept a <<length>> or a <<percentage>>,
		both representing a measure of distance.
		This means that ''width: calc(500px + 50%);'' is allowed--
		both values are converted to absolute lengths and added.
		If the containing block is ''1000px'' wide,
		then ''width: 50%;'' is equivalent to ''width: 500px'',
		and ''width: calc(50% + 500px)'' thus ends up equivalent to ''width: calc(500px + 500px)'' or ''width: 1000px''.

		On the other hand, the second and third arguments of the ''hsl()'' function
		can only be expressed as <<percentage>>s.
		Although ''calc()'' productions are allowed in their place,
		they can only combine percentages with themselves,
		as in ''calc(10% + 20%)''.
	</div>

	Note: Specifications should never alternate <<percentage>> in place of a dimension
	in a grammar unless they are <a>compatible</a>.

	Note: More &lt;TYPE-percentage> productions can be added in the future as needed.
	A &lt;number-percentage> will never be added,
	as <<number>> and <<percentage>> can't be combined in ''calc()''.

<h2 id="lengths">
Distance Units: the <<length>> type</h2>

	Lengths refer to distance measurements
	and are denoted by <dfn id="length-value">&lt;length></dfn> in the property definitions.
	A length is a <a>dimension</a>.

	For zero lengths the unit identifier is optional
	(i.e. can be syntactically represented as the <<number>> ''0'').
	However, if a ''0'' could be parsed as either a <<number>> or a <<length>> in a property
	(such as 'line-height'),
	it must parse as a <<number>>.

	Properties may restrict the length value to some range.
	If the value is outside the allowed range,
	the declaration is invalid and must be <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignored</a>.

	While some properties allow negative length values,
	this may complicate the formatting and there may be implementation-specific limits.
	If a negative length value is allowed but cannot be supported,
	it must be converted to the nearest value that can be supported.

	In cases where the <a lt="used value">used</a> length cannot be supported,
	user agents must approximate it in the <a lt="actual value">actual</a> value.

	There are two types of length units: <a lt="relative length">relative</a> and <a lt="absolute length">absolute</a>.

<h3 id="relative-lengths">
Relative Lengths</h3>

	<dfn lt="relative length">Relative length units</dfn> specify a length relative to another length.

	Issue: We can potentially add more typographic units,
	like cicero, didot, etc.
	They're just absolute units,
	and so can be done with the existing units,
	but is there enough desire for them
	(potentially for printing use-cases)
	that it would be worth adding them?
	Or should we just wait for Houdini Custom Units?

	When used outside the context of an element
	(such as in <a>media queries</a>),
	these units refer to the metrics corresponding
	to the initial values of the 'font' and 'line-height' properties.
	When used in the value of the 'font-size' property on the element they refer to,
	they resolve against the computed metrics of the parent element--
	or against the computed metrics corresponding to the initial values
	of the 'font' and 'line-height' properties,
	if the element has no parent.
	Additionally,
	when ''lh'' or ''rlh'' units are used
	in the value of the 'line-height' property on the element they refer to,
	they resolve against the computed 'line-height' and font metrics of the parent element--
	or the computed metrics corresponding to the initial values
	of the 'font' and 'line-height' properties,
	if the element has no parent.
	(The other font-relative units continue to resolve against
	the element’s own metrics when used in 'line-height'.)

<h4 id="viewport-relative-lengths">
Viewport-percentage Lengths: the ''vw'', ''vh'', ''vi'', ''vb'', ''vmin'', ''vmax'' units</h4>

	The <dfn export>viewport-percentage lengths</dfn> are relative to the size of the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#containing-block-details">initial containing block</a>.
	When the height or width of the initial containing block is changed,
	they are scaled accordingly.
	However, when the value of 'overflow' on the root element is ''overflow/auto'',
	any scroll bars are assumed not to exist.
	<span class='note'>Note that the initial containing block's size is affected by the presence of scrollbars on the viewport.</span>

	For paged media, the exact definition of the viewport-percentage lengths
	is deferred to [[!CSS3PAGE]].

	<dl export dfn-type=value dfn-for="<length>">

	In situations where there is no root element

	</div>

	All of the absolute length units are <a>compatible</a>,
	and ''px'' is their <a>canonical unit</a>.

	For a CSS device, these dimensions are <dfn lt="anchor unit | anchor">anchored</dfn> either

	<ol type=i>
		<li>by relating the <a>physical units</a> to their physical measurements, or
		<li>by relating the <a>pixel unit</a> to the <a>reference pixel</a>.
	</ol>

	For print media at typical viewing distances,
	the [=anchor unit=] should be one of the [=physical units=] (inches, centimeters, etc).
	For screen media (including high-resolution devices),
	low-resolution devices,
	and devices with unusual viewing distances),
	it is recommended instead that the [=anchor unit=] be the [=pixel unit=].
	For such devices it is recommended that the [=pixel unit=]
	refer to the whole number of device pixels that best approximates the reference pixel.

	Note: If the [=anchor unit=] is the [=pixel unit=],
	the [=physical units=] might not match their physical measurements.
	Alternatively if the [=anchor unit=] is a [=physical unit=],
	the [=pixel unit=] might not map to a whole number of device pixels.

	Note: This definition of the [=pixel unit=] and the [=physical units=]
	differs from previous versions of CSS.
	In particular, in previous versions of CSS the [=pixel unit=] and the [=physical units=]
	were not related by a fixed ratio:
	the [=physical units=] were always tied to their physical measurements
	while the [=pixel unit=] would vary to most closely match the reference pixel.
	(This change was made because too much existing content relies on the assumption of 96dpi,
	and breaking that assumption broke the content.)

	Note: Values are case-insensitive and serialize as lower case, for example 1Q serializes as 1q.

	The <dfn export>reference pixel</dfn> is the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96dpi
	and a distance from the reader of an arm's length.
	For a nominal arm's length of 28 inches,
	the visual angle is therefore about 0.0213 degrees.
	For reading at arm's length,
	1px thus corresponds to about 0.26&nbsp;mm (1/96&nbsp;inch).

	The image below illustrates the effect of viewing distance on the size of a reference pixel:
	a reading distance of 71&nbsp;cm (28&nbsp;inches)
	results in a reference pixel of 0.26&nbsp;mm,
	while a reading distance of 3.5&nbsp;m (12&nbsp;feet)
	results in a reference pixel of 1.3&nbsp;mm.

	<figure>

		             from the user's eye onto each plane. Where the cone
		             strikes the first plane, the projected pixel is 0.26 mm
		             high. Where the cone strikes the second plane, the
		             projected pixel is 1.4 mm high.">

	This second image illustrates the effect of a device's resolution
	on the pixel unit: an area of 1px by 1px is covered by a single dot
	in a low-resolution device (e.g. a typical computer display), while
	the same area is covered by 16 dots in a higher resolution device
	(such as a printer).

<h3 id="angles">
Angle Units: the <<angle>> type and ''deg'', ''grad'', ''rad'', ''turn'' units</h3>

	Angle values are <<dimension>>s denoted by <dfn id="angle-value">&lt;angle></dfn>.
	The angle unit identifiers are:

	<dl export dfn-type=value dfn-for="<angle>">
		<dt><dfn id="deg">deg</dfn>
		<dd>
			Degrees. There are 360 degrees in a full circle.

		<dt><dfn id="grad">grad</dfn>
		<dd>
			Gradians, also known as "gons" or "grades".
			There are 400 gradians in a full circle.

		<dt><dfn id="rad">rad</dfn>
		<dd>
			Radians. There are 2&pi; radians in a full circle.

		<dt><dfn id="turn">turn</dfn>
		<dd>
			Turns. There is 1 turn in a full circle.
	</dl>

	For example, a right angle is ''90deg'' or ''100grad'' or ''0.25turn'' or
	approximately ''1.57rad''.

	All <<angle>> units are <a>compatible</a>,
	and ''deg'' is their <a>canonical unit</a>.

	<div class="note">
		By convention,
		when an angle denotes a direction in CSS,
		it is typically interpreted as a <dfn export>bearing angle</dfn>,
		where 0deg is "up" or "north" on the screen,
		and larger angles are more clockwise
		(so 90deg is "right" or "east").

		For example, in the ''linear-gradient()'' function,
		the <<angle>> that determines the direction of the gradient
		is interpreted as a bearing angle.
	</div>

	Note: For legacy reasons,
	some uses of <<angle>> allow a bare ''0'' to mean ''0deg''.
	This is not true in general, however,
	and will not occur in future uses of the <<angle>> type.

Frequency Units: the <<frequency>> type and ''Hz'', ''kHz'' units</h3>

	Frequency values are <a>dimensions</a> denoted by <dfn id="frequency-value">&lt;frequency></dfn>.
	The frequency unit identifiers are:

	<dl export dfn-type=value dfn-for="<frequency>">
	  <dt><dfn id="Hz">Hz</dfn>
	  <dd>Hertz. It represents the number of occurrences per second.
	  <dt><dfn id="kHz">kHz</dfn>
	  <dd>KiloHertz. A kiloHertz is 1000 Hertz.
	</dl>

	For example, when representing sound pitches, 200Hz (or 200hz)
	is a bass sound, and 6kHz (or 6khz) is a treble sound.

	All <<frequency>> units are <a>compatible</a>,
	and ''hz'' is their <a>canonical unit</a>.

	Note: Values are case-insensitive and serialize as lower case, for example 1Hz serializes as 1hz.

Resolution Units: the <<resolution>> type and ''&lt;resolution&gt;/dpi'', ''&lt;resolution&gt;/dpcm'', ''&lt;resolution&gt;/dppx'' units</h3>

	Resolution units are <a>dimensions</a> denoted by <dfn id="resolution-value">&lt;resolution></dfn>.
	The resolution unit identifiers are:

	<dl export dfn-type=value dfn-for="<resolution>">
		<dt><dfn id="dpi">dpi</dfn>

		<dd>Dots per centimeter.

		<dt><dfn id="dppx">dppx</dfn>
		<dt><dfn id="x">x</dfn>
		<dd>Dots per ''px'' unit.
	</dl>

	The <<resolution>> unit represents the size of a single "dot" in a graphical representation
	by indicating how many of these dots fit in a CSS ''in'', ''cm'', or ''px''.
	For uses, see e.g. the  ''resolution'' media query in [[MEDIAQ]]
	or the 'image-resolution' property defined in [[CSS3-IMAGES]].

	All <<resolution>> units are <a>compatible</a>,
	and ''&lt;resolution>/dppx'' is their <a>canonical unit</a>.

	<p class="note">Note that due to the 1:96 fixed ratio of CSS ''in'' to CSS ''px'',
	''1dppx'' is equivalent to ''96dpi''.
	This corresponds to the default resolution of images displayed in CSS:

<h3 id="position">
2D Positioning: the <<position>> type</h3>

	The <dfn><<position>></dfn> value specifies the position of a object area (e.g. background image)
	inside a positioning area (e.g. background positioning area).
	It is interpreted as specified for 'background-position'. [[!CSS3-BACKGROUND]]

	<pre class=prod>
		<<position>> = [
		  [ left | center | right ] || [ top | center | bottom ]
		|
		  [ left | center | right | <<length-percentage>> ]
		  [ top | center | bottom | <<length-percentage>> ]?
		|
		  [ [ left | right ] <<length-percentage>> ] &amp;&amp;
		  [ [ top | bottom ] <<length-percentage>> ]
		]
	</pre>

	Note: The 'background-position' property also accepts a three-value syntax.
	This has been disallowed generically because it creates parsing ambiguities
	when combined with other length or percentage components in a property value.

	The canonical order when serializing is
	the horizontal component followed by the vertical component.

	When specified in a grammar alongside other keywords, <<length>>s, or <<percentage>>s,
	<<position>> is <em>greedily</em> parsed;
	it consumes as many components as possible.

	<div class=example>
		For example,
		'transform-origin' defines a 3D position
		as (effectively) ''<<position>> <<length>>?''.
		A value such as ''left 50px''
		will be parsed as a 2-value <<position>>,
		with an omitted z-component;
		on the other hand,
		a value such as ''top 50px''
		will be parsed as a single-value <<position>>
		followed by a <<length>>.
	</div>

<h4 id="combine-positions">
Combination of <<position>></h4>

	<a>Interpolation</a> of <<position>> is defined as
	the independent interpolation of each component (x, y)
	normalized as an offset from the top left corner
	as a <<length-percentage>>.

	<a>Addition</a> of <<position>> is likewise defined as
	the independent <a>addition</a> each component (x, y)
	normalized as an offset from the top left corner
	as a <<length-percentage>>.

<h2 id="functional-notations">
Functional Notations</h2>

	A <dfn export>functional notation</dfn> is a type of component value
	that can represent more complex types or invoke special processing.
	The syntax starts with the name of the function
	immediately followed by a left parenthesis
	(i.e. a <<function-token>>)
	followed by the argument(s) to the notation
	followed by a right parenthesis.
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace">White space</a> is allowed, but optional,
	immediately inside the parentheses.
	Functions can take multiple arguments,
	which are formatted similarly to a CSS property value.

	Some legacy <a>functional notations</a>, such as ''rgba()'', use commas unnecessarily,
	but generally commas are only used to separate items in a list,
	or pieces of a grammar that would be ambiguous otherwise.
	If a comma is used to separate arguments,
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace">white space</a> is optional before and after the comma.

<h3 id="toggle-notation">
Toggling Between Values: ''toggle()''</h3>

	The <dfn>toggle()</dfn> expression allows descendant elements
	to cycle over a list of values instead of inheriting the same value.

	<div class='example'>
		The following example makes <code>&lt;em></code> elements italic in general,
		but makes them normal if they're inside something that's italic:

		<pre>em { font-style: toggle(italic, normal); }</pre>
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		The following example cycles markers for nested lists,
		so that a top level list has ''list-style-type/disc''-shaped markers,
		but nested lists use ''list-style-type/circle'', then ''list-style-type/square'', then ''list-style-type/box'',
		and then repeat through the list of marker shapes,
		starting again (for the 5th list deep) with ''list-style-type/disc''.

		<pre>ul { list-style-type: toggle(disc, circle, square, box); }</pre>
	</div>

	The syntax of the ''toggle()'' expression is:

	<pre>toggle( <<toggle-value>># )</pre>

	where <dfn>&lt;toggle-value></dfn> is any CSS value
	that is valid where the expression is placed,
	and that doesn't contain any top-level commas.
	If any of the values inside are not valid,
	then the entire ''toggle()'' expression is invalid.
	The ''toggle()'' expression may be used as the value of any property,
	but must be the only component in that property's value.

	The ''toggle()'' notation is not allowed to be nested; nor may it
	contain ''attr()'' or ''calc()'' notations.
	Declarations containing such constructs are invalid.

	<div class="example">
		The following ''toggle()'' examples are all invalid:

		<pre>
		background-position: 10px toggle(50px, 100px);
		/* toggle() must be the sole value of the property */

		list-style-type: toggle(disc, 50px);
		/* ''50px'' isn't a valid value of 'list-style-type' */
		</pre>
	</div>

	To determine the computed value of ''toggle()'',
	first evaluate each argument as if it were the sole value of the property in which ''toggle()'' is placed
	to determine the computed value that each represents,
	called <var>C<sub>n</sub></var> for the <var>n</var>-th argument to ''toggle()''.
	Then, compare the property's <a>inherited value</a>
	with each <var>C<sub>n</sub></var>.
	For the earliest <var>C<sub>n</sub></var> that matches the <a>inherited value</a>,
	the computed value of ''toggle()'' is <var>C<sub>n+1</sub></var>.
	If the match was the last argument in the list,
	or there was no match,
	the computed value of ''toggle()'' is the computed value that the first argument represents.


	Note: This means that repeating values in a ''toggle()'' short-circuits the list.
	For example ''toggle(1em, 2em, 1em, 4em)'' will be equivalent to ''toggle(1em, 2em)''.

	<!-- Issue: Should this short-circuiting affect the computed value? -->

	Note: That ''toggle()'' explicitly looks at the computed value of the parent,
	so it works even on non-inherited properties.
	This is similar to the ''inherit'' keyword,
	which works even on non-inherited properties.

	Note: That the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#computed-value">computed value</a> of a property is an abstract set of values,
	not a particular serialization [[!CSS21]],
	so comparison between computed values should always be unambiguous and have the expected result.
	For example,
	a Level 2 <l spec=css2>'background-position'</l> computed value
	is just two offsets, each represented as an absolute length or a percentage,
	so the declarations ''background-position: top center'' and ''background-position: 50% 0%''
	produce identical computed values.
	If the "Computed Value" line of a property definition seems to define something ambiguous or overly strict,
	please <a href="#status">provide feedback</a> so we can fix it.

	If ''toggle()'' is used on a <a>shorthand property</a>,
	it sets each of its longhands to a ''toggle()'' value
	with arguments corresponding to what the longhand would have received
	had each of the original ''toggle()'' arguments been the sole value of the <a>shorthand</a>.

	<div class="example">
		For example, the following shorthand declaration:

		<pre>margin: toggle(1px 2px, 4px, 1px 5px 4px);</pre>

		is equivalent to the following longhand declarations:

		<pre>
		margin-top:    toggle(1px, 4px, 1px);
		margin-right:  toggle(2px, 4px, 5px);
		margin-bottom: toggle(1px, 4px, 4px);
		margin-left:   toggle(2px, 4px, 5px);
		</pre>

		Note that, since ''1px'' appears twice in the top margin and ''4px'' appears twice in bottom margin,
		they will cycle between only two values
		while the left and right margins cycle through three.
		In other words, the declarations above will yield the same computed values
		as the longhand declarations below:

		<pre>
		margin-top:    toggle(1px, 4px);
		margin-right:  toggle(2px, 4px, 5px);
		margin-bottom: toggle(1px, 4px);
		margin-left:   toggle(2px, 4px, 5px);
		</pre>

		which may not be what was intended.

<h3 id="attr-notation">
Attribute References: ''attr()''</h3>

<!--
Ian's proposal:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2002OctDec/0141.html
-->

	The <dfn>attr()</dfn> function is allowed as a component value in properties applied to an element or pseudo-element.
	It returns the value of an attribute on the element.
	If used on a pseudo-element, it returns the value of the attribute on the pseudo-element's originating element.

	The computed value of the ''attr()'' expression is the value of the attribute with the specified name on the element, according to the rules given below.

	Note: In CSS2.1 [[!CSS21]], the ''attr()'' expression always returns a string.
	In CSS3, the ''attr()'' expression can return many different types.
	The ''attr()'' expression cannot return everything,
	for example it cannot do counters, named strings, quotes,
	or keyword values such as <css>auto</css>, <css>nowrap</css>, or <css>baseline</css>.
	This is intentional,
	as the intent of the ''attr()'' expression is not to make it possible to describe a presentational language's formatting using CSS,
	but to enable CSS to take semantic data into account.

	The new syntax for the ''attr()'' expression is:

	<pre>attr( <<attr-name>> <<type-or-unit>>? [ , <<attr-fallback>> ]? )</pre>

	where <dfn>&lt;attr-name></dfn> is a <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css3-namespace/#css-qnames">CSS qualified name</a>
	(the qname production in [[!CSS3NAMESPACE]])
	that represents an attribute name.
	(In the absence of namespacing, this will just be a CSS identifier.)
	As with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#attribute-selectors">attribute selectors</a>,
	the case-sensitivity of <<attr-name>> depends on the document language.

	The optional <dfn>&lt;type-or-unit></dfn> argument is a keyword drawn from the list below that tells the UA how to interpret the attribute value,
	and defines a type for the attr() expression.
	If omitted, ''string'' is implied.

	The optional <dfn>&lt;attr-fallback></dfn> argument represents a fallback value,
	which is used if the named attribute is missing,
	or its value cannot be parsed into the given type or is invalid/out-of-range for the property.
	If it's absent,
	the default value for the given <<type-or-unit>> (from the list below) is implied.

	Note: Unlike <<toggle-value>>s,
	an ''attr()'' <<attr-fallback>> value may contain top-level commas,
	as it is always the last argument in the functional notation.

	The attr() expression is only valid if:

	<ul>
		<li>
			the attr() expression's type is valid where the attr() expression is placed,

		<li>
			the namespace prefix of the attribute name, if any, is defined,

		<li>
			the <<attr-fallback>> is valid where the attr() expression is placed,

		<li>
			the <<attr-fallback>> does not contain another attr() expression,

		<li>
			and, if the attr() expression is not the sole component value of a property,
			the <<attr-fallback>> matches the attr()’s type
	</ul>

	<div class='note'>
		Note that the default value need not be of the type given,
		if the attr() expression is the entire property value.
		For instance, if the type required of the attribute by the author is ''px'',
		the default could still be <css>auto</css>,
		like in ''width: attr(size px, auto);''.

		If the attr() is used alongside other values to form the full property value,
		however, then the default value must match the attr()&#39;s type.
		For example, ''box-shadow: attr(size px, inset) 5px 10px blue;'' is invalid,
		even though it would create a valid declaration if you substituted the attr() expression
		with either a ''px'' length <em>or</em> the ''box-shadow/inset'' keyword.
	</div>

	If the specified attribute exists on the element,
	the value of the attribute must be parsed as required by the <<type-or-unit>> argument
	(as defined in the list below).
	Unless the type is ''string'', it must first be stripped of leading and trailing
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax/#whitespace">white space</a>.
	The resulting value is the attr() expression's value.
	If the value did not parse as required,
	the attr() expression's value is its fallback value.

	The <<type-or-unit>> keywords are:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="<type-or-value>">
		<dt><dfn>string</dfn>
		<dd>
			The attribute value is taken as the contents of a CSS <<string>>.
			The default is the empty string.

			Note: This does not reparse the attribute value with the CSS parser.
			So, for example, an attribute whose value is "\51" will produce a string containing those three characters,
			not a string containing "Q" (the character that the escape would evaluate to).

		<dt><dfn>color</dfn>
		<dd>
			The attribute value must parse as a <<hash-token>> or <<ident-token>>,
			and be successfully interpreted as a <<color>>.
			The default is ''currentcolor''.

		<dt><dfn>url</dfn>
		<dd>
			The attribute value is taken as the contents of a CSS <<string>>.
			It is interpreted as a quoted string within the ''url()'' notation.
			The default is ''about:invalid'', which is a URL defined (<a href="#about-invalid">in Appendix A</a>) to point
			to a non-existent document with a generic error condition.
			Relative URLs must be made absolute
			according to the rules of the document language as applied to URLs originating from the element;
			they are not relative to the style sheet.

		<dt><dfn>integer</dfn>
		<dd>
			The attribute value must parse as a <<number-token>>,
			and be successfully interpreted as an <<integer>>.
			The default is ''0'',
			or else the property's minimum value if ''0'' is not valid for the property.
			The default must also be used
			if the property in question only accepts integers within a certain range
			and the attribute is out of range.

		<dt><dfn>number</dfn>
		<dd>
			The attribute value must parse as a <<number-token>>,
			and is interpreted as an <<number>>.
			The default is ''0'',
			or else the property's minimum value if ''0'' is not valid for the property.
			The default must also be used
			if the property in question only accepts integers within a certain range
			and the attribute is out of range.

Mathematical Expressions</h2>

	The <dfn export lt="math function">math functions</dfn>
	(''calc()'', ''clamp()'', ''sin()'',
	and others defined in this chapter)
	allow numeric CSS values
	to be written as mathematical expressions.

	A [=math function=] represents a numeric value,
	one of:

	* <<length>>,
	* <<frequency>>,
	* <<angle>>,
	* <<time>>,
	* <<flex>>,
	* <<resolution>>,
	* <<percentage>>,
	* <<number>>,
	* <<integer>>

	...or the <<length-percentage>>/etc mixed types,
	and can be used wherever such a value would be valid.

<h3 id=calc-func>
Basic Arithmetic: ''calc()''</h3>

	The <dfn>calc()</dfn> function is a [=math function=]
	that allows basic arithmetic to be performed on numerical values,
	using addition (<css>+</css>), subtraction (<css>-</css>), multiplication (<css>*</css>), division (<css>/</css>),
	and parentheses.

	A ''calc()'' function contains a single <dfn export for="calc()">calculation</dfn>,
	which is a sequence of values interspersed with operators,
	and possibly grouped by parentheses
	(matching the <<calc-sum>> grammar),
	which represents the result of evaluating the expression
	using standard operator precedence rules.
	(<css>*</css> and <css>/</css> bind tighter than <css>+</css> and <css>-</css>,
	and operators are otherwise evaluated left-to-right.)
	The ''calc()'' function represents the result of its contained [=calculation=].

	Components of a [=calculation=] can be literal values
	(such as ''5px''),
	other [=math functions=],
	or other expressions, such as ''attr()'',
	that evaluate to a valid argument type (like <<length>>).

	<div class="example">

		[=Math functions=] can be used to combine value that use different units.
		In this example the author wants the <em>margin box</em> of each section
		to take up 1/3 of the space,
		so they start with <css>100%/3</css>,
		then subtract the element's borders and margins.
		('box-sizing' can automatically achieve this effect for borders and padding,
		but a [=math function=] is needed if you want to include margins.)

		<pre class=lang-css>
		section {
		  float: left;
		  margin: 1em; border: solid 1px;
		  width: calc(100% / 3 - 2 * 1em - 2 * 1px);
		}
		</pre>

		Similarly, in this example the gradient will show a color transition
		only in the first and last ''20px'' of the element:

		<pre class=lang-css>
		.fade {
			background-image: linear-gradient(silver 0%, white 20px,
			                                  white calc(100% - 20px), silver 100%);
		}
		</pre>
	</div>

	<div class="example">

		[=Math functions=] can also be useful just to express values
		in a more natural, readable fashion,
		rather than as an obscure decimal.
		For example, the following sets the 'font-size' so that exactly 35em fits within the viewport,
		ensuring that roughly the same amount of text always fills the screen no matter the screen size.

		<pre class=lang-css>
		:root {
			font-size: calc(100vw / 35);
		}
		</pre>

		Functionality-wise, this is identical to just writing ''font-size: 2.857vw'',
		but then the intent
		(that ''35em'' fills the viewport)
		is much less clear to someone reading the code;
		the later reader will have to reverse the math themselves
		to figure out that 2.857 is meant to approximate 100/35.
	</div>

	<div class="example">

		Standard mathematical precedence rules for the operators apply:
		''calc(2 + 3 * 4)'' is equal to ''14'',
		not ''20''.

		Parentheses can be used to manipulate precedence:
		''calc((2 + 3) * 4)'' is instead equal to ''20''.

		Parentheses and nesting additional ''calc()'' functions are equivalent;
		the preceding expression could equivalently have been written as
		''calc(calc(2 + 3) * 4)''.
		This can be useful when building up values piecemeal via ''var()'',
		such as in the following example:

		<pre class=lang-css>
		.aspect-ratio-box {
			--ar: calc(16 / 9);
			--w: calc(100% / 3);
			--h: calc(var(--w) / var(--ar));
			width: var(--w);
			height: var(--h);
		}
		</pre>

		Altho '--ar' <em>could</em> have been written as simply
		''--ar: (16 / 9);'',
		'--w' is used both on its own (in 'width')
		and as a ''calc()'' component (in '--h'),
		so it has to be written as a full ''calc()'' function itself.

<h3 id=comp-func>
Comparison Functions: ''min()'', ''max()'', and ''clamp()''</h3>

	The comparison functions of ''min()'', ''max()'', and ''clamp()''
	compare multiple [=calculations=]
	and represent the value of one of them.

	The <dfn>min()</dfn> or <dfn>max()</dfn> functions
	contain one or more comma-separated [=calculations=],
	and represent the smallest (most negative) or largest (most positive) of them, respectively.

	The <dfn>clamp()</dfn> function takes three [=calculations=]--
	a minimum value, a central value, and a maximum value--
	and represents its central calculation,
	clamped according to its min and max calculations,
	favoring the min calculation if it conflicts with the max.
	(That is, given ''clamp(MIN, VAL, MAX)'',
	it represents exactly the same value as ''max(MIN, min(VAL, MAX))'').

	<div class="example">

		''min()'', ''max()'', and ''clamp()'' can be used to make sure a value doesn't exceed a "safe" limit:
		For example, "responsive type" that sets 'font-size' with viewport units
		might still want a minimum size to ensure readability:

		<pre class=lang-css>
		.type {
			/* Set font-size to 10x the average of vw and vh,
			   but don't let it go below 12px. */
			font-size: max(10 * (1vw + 1vh) / 2, 12px);
		}
		</pre>

		Note: Full math expressions are allowed in each of the arguments;
		there's no need to nest a ''calc()'' inside!
		You can also provide more than two arguments,
		if you have multiple constraints to apply.
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		An occasional point of confusion when using ''min()''/''max()''
		is that you use ''max()'' to impose a minimum value on something
		(that is, properties like 'min-width' effectively use ''max()''),
		and ''min()'' to impose a maximum value on something;
		it's easy to accidentally reach for the opposite function
		and try to use ''min()'' to add a minimum size.
		Using ''clamp()'' can make the code read more naturally,
		as the value is nestled between its minimum and maximum:

		<pre class=lang-css>
		.type {
			/* Force the font-size to stay between 12px and 100px */
			font-size: clamp(12px, 10 * (1vw + 1vh) / 2, 100px);
		}
		</pre>
	</div>

	<div class=note>
		Note that ''clamp()'',
		matching CSS conventions elsewhere,
		has its minimum value "win" over its maximum value
		if the two are in the "wrong order".
		That is, ''clamp(100px, ..., 50px)''
		will resolve to ''100px'',
		exceeding its stated "max" value.

		If alternate resolution mechanics are desired
		they can be achieved by combining ''clamp()'' with ''min()'' or ''max()'':

		: To have MAX win over MIN:
		::
			''clamp(min(MIN, MAX), VAL, MAX)''.
			If you want to avoid repeating the MAX calculation,
			you can just reverse the nesting of functions that ''clamp()'' is defined against--
			''min(MAX, max(MIN, VAL))''.

		: To have MAX and MIN "swap" when they're in the wrong order:
		::
			''clamp(min(MIN, MAX), VAL, max(MIN, MAX))''.
			Unfortunately, there's no easy way to do this without repeating the MIN and MAX terms.
	</div>


<h3 id=trig-funcs>
Trigonometric Functions: ''sin()'', ''cos()'', ''tan()'', ''asin()'', ''acos()'', ''atan()'', and ''atan2()''</h3>

	The trigonometric functions--
	''sin()'', ''cos()'', ''tan()'', ''asin()'', ''acos()'', ''atan()'', and ''atan2()''--
	compute the various basic trigonometric relationships.

	The <dfn lt="sin()">sin(A)</dfn>, <dfn lt="cos()">cos(A)</dfn>, and <dfn lt="tan()">tan(A)</dfn> functions
	all contain a single [=calculation=]
	which must resolve to either a <<number>>
	or an <<angle>>,
	and compute their corresponding function
	by interpreting the result of their argument as radians.
	(That is, ''sin(45deg)'', ''sin(.125turn)'', and ''sin(3.14159 / 4)''
	all represent the same value,
	approximately ''.707''.)
	They all represent a <<number>>;
	''sin()'' and ''cos()'' will always return a number between −1 and 1,
	while ''tan()'' can return any number between −∞ and +∞.
	(See [[#calc-type-checking]] for details on how [=math functions=] handle ∞.)

	The <dfn lt="asin()">asin(A)</dfn>, <dfn lt="acos()">acos(A)</dfn>, and <dfn lt="atan()">atan(A)</dfn> functions
	are the "arc" or "inverse" trigonometric functions,
	representing the inverse function to their corresponding "normal" trig functions.
	All of them contain a single [=calculation=]
	which must resolve to a <<number>>,
	and compute their corresponding function,
	interpreting their result as a number of radians,
	representing an <<angle>>.
	The angle returned by ''asin()'' must be normalized to the range [''-90deg'', ''90deg''];
	the angle returned by ''acos()'' to the range [''0deg'', ''180deg''];
	and the angle returned by ''atan()'' to the range [''-90deg'', ''90deg''].

	The <dfn lt="atan2()">atan2(A, B)</dfn> function
	contains two comma-separated [=calculations=], A and B.
	A and B can resolve to any <<number>>, <<dimension>>, or <<percentage>>,
	but must have the <em>same</em> [=determine the type of a calculation|type=],
	or else the function is invalid.
	The function returns the <<angle>>
	between the positive X-axis and the point (B,A).
	The returned angle must be normalized to the interval (''-180deg'', ''180deg'']
	(that is, greater than ''-180deg'', and less than or equal to ''180deg'').

	Note: ''atan2(Y, X)'' is <em>generally</em> equivalent to ''atan(Y / X)'',
	but it gives a better answer when the point in question may include negative components.
	''atan2(1, -1)'', corresponding to the point (-1, 1),
	returns ''135deg'',
	distinct from ''atan2(-1, 1)'', corresponding to the point (1, -1),
	which returns ''-45deg''.
	In contrast, ''atan(1 / -1)'' and ''atan(-1 / 1)'' both return''-45deg'',
	because the internal calculation resolves to ''-1'' for both.


<h4 id="trig-infinities">
Argument Ranges</h4>

	In ''sin(A)'', ''cos(A)'', or ''tan(A)'',
	if A is infinite,
	the result is NaN.
	(See [[#calc-type-checking]] for details on how [=math functions=] handle NaN.)

	In ''sin(A)'' or ''tan(A)'',
	if A is 0⁻,
	the result is 0⁻.

	In ''tan(A)'', if A is one of the asymptote values
	(such as ''90deg'', ''270deg'', etc),
	the result must be +∞ for ''90deg'' and all values a multiple of ''360deg'' from that
	(such as ''-270deg'' or ''450deg''),
	and −∞ for ''-90deg'' and all values a multiple of ''360deg'' from that
	(such as ''-450deg'' or ''270deg'').

	Note: This is only relevant for units that can exactly represent the asymptotic values,
	such as ''deg'' or ''grad''.
	''rad'' cannot,
	and so whether the result is a very large negative or positive value
	can depend on rounding and precise details of how numbers are internally stored.
	It's recommended you don't depend on this behavior if using such units.

	In ''asin(A)'' or ''acos(A)'',
	if A is less than -1 or greater than 1,
	the result is NaN.

	In ''acos(A)'',
	if A is exactly 1,
	the result is 0.

	In ''asin(A)'' or ''atan(A)'',
	if A is 0⁻,
	the result is 0⁻.

	In ''atan(A)'',
	if A is +∞,
	the result is ''90deg'';
	if A is −∞,
	the result is ''-90deg''.

	In ''atan2(Y, X)'',
	the following table gives the results for all unusual argument combinations:

	<table class=data>
		<thead>
			<tr><td style="border:none" colspan=2><th colspan=6>X
			<tr><td style="border:none" colspan=2><th>−∞ <th>-finite <th>0⁻ <th>0⁺ <th>+finite <th>+∞

	</table>

	Note: All of these behaviors are intended to match the "standard" definitions of these functions
	as implemented by most programming languages,
	in particular as implemented in JS.

	Note: The behavior of ''tan(90deg)'',
	while not constrained by JS behavior
	(because the JS function's input is in radians,
	and one cannot perfectly express a value of π/2 in JS numbers),
	is defined so that roundtripping of values works;
	''tan(atan(1 / 0))'' yields +∞,
	''tan(atan(-1 / 0))'' yields −∞,
	''atan(tan(90deg))'' yields ''90deg'',
	and ''atan(tan(-90deg))'' yields ''-90deg''.


<h3 id=exponent-funcs>
Exponential  Functions: ''pow()'', ''sqrt()'', ''hypot()''</h3>

	The exponential functions--
	''pow()'', ''sqrt()'', and ''hypot()''--
	compute various exponential functions with their arguments.

	The <dfn lt="pow()">pow(A, B)</dfn> function
	contains two comma-separated [=calculations=] A and B,
	both of which must resolve to <<number>>s,
	and returns the result of raising A to the power of B,
	returning the value as a <<number>>.

	The <dfn lt="sqrt()">sqrt(A)</dfn> function
	contains a single [=calculation=]
	which must resolve to a <<number>>,
	and returns the square root of the value
	as a <<number>>.
	(''sqrt(X)'' and ''pow(X, .5)'' are basically equivalent,
	differing only in some error-handling;
	''sqrt()'' is a common enough function
	that it is provided as a convenience.)

	The <dfn lt="hypot()">hypot(A, …)</dfn> function
	contains one or more comma-separated [=calculations=],
	and returns the length of an N-dimensional vector
	with components equal to each of the [=calculations=].
	(That is,
	the square root of the sum of the squares of its arguments.)
	The argument [=calculations=] can resolve to any <<number>>, <<dimension>>, or <<percentage>>,
	but must have the <em>same</em> [=determine the type of a calculation|type=],
	or else the function is invalid;
	the result will have the same [=CSSNumericValue/type=] as the arguments.

	<details class=note>
		<summary>Why does ''hypot()'' allow dimensions (values with units), but ''pow()'' and ''sqrt()'' only work on numbers?</summary>

		You are allowed to write expressions like ''hypot(30px, 40px)'',
		which resolves to ''50px'',
		but you aren't allowed to write the expression
		''sqrt(pow(30px, 2) + pow(40px, 2))'',
		despite the two being equivalent in most mathematical systems.

		There are two reasons for this:
		numeric precision in the exponents,
		and clashing expectations from authors.

		First, numerical precision.
		For a [=CSSNumericValue/type=] to [=CSSNumericValue/match=] a CSS production like <<length>>,
		it needs to have a single unit with its exponent set to exactly 1.
		Theoretically, expressions like ''pow(pow(30px, 3), 1/3)'' should result in exactly that:
		the inner ''pow(30px, 3)'' would resolve to a value of 27000 with a [=CSSNumericValue/type=] of «[ "length" → 3 ]»
		(aka <<length>>³),
		and then the ''pow(X, 1/3)'' would cube-root the value back down to 30 and multiply the exponent by 1/3,
		giving «[ "length" → 1 ]»,
		which [=CSSNumericValue/matches=] <<length>>.

		In the realm of pure mathematics, that's guaranteed to work out;
		in the real-world of computers using binary floating-point arithmetic,
		in some cases the powers might not exactly cancel out,
		leaving you with an invalid [=math function=]
		for confusing, hard-to-track-down reasons.
		(For a JS example,
		evaluate <code>Math.pow(Math.pow(30, 10/3), .1+.1+.1)</code>;
		the result is not exactly 30,
		because <code>.1+.1+.1</code> is not exactly 3/10.
		Instead, <code>(10/3) * (.1 + .1 + .1)</code> is <em>slightly greater</em> than 1.)

		Requiring authors to cast their value down into a number,
		do all the math on the raw number,
		then finally send it back to the desired unit,
		while inconvenient,
		ensures that numerical precision won't bite anyone:
		''calc(pow(pow(30px / 1px, 3), 1/3) * 1px)'' is guaranteed to resolve to a <<length>>,
		with a value that, if not exactly 30, is at least very close to 30,
		even if numerical precision actually prevents the powers from exactly canceling.

		Second, clashing expectations.
		It's not uncommon for authors to expect ''pow(30px, 2)''
		to result in ''900px''
		(such as in <a href="https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/684">this Sass issue</a>);
		that is,
		just squaring the numerical value
		and leaving the unit alone.
		This, however, means the result is dependent on what unit you're expressing the argument in;
		if ''1em'' is ''16px'',
		then ''pow(1em, 2)'' would give ''1em'',
		while ''pow(16px, 2)'' would give ''256px'', or ''16em'',
		which are very different values for what should otherwise be identical input arguments!
		This sort of input dependency is troublesome for CSS,
		which generally allows values to be [=canonical unit|canonicalized=] freely;
		it also makes more complex expressions like ''pow(2em + 10px, 2)'' difficult to interpret.

		Again, requiring authors to cast their value down into a number
		and then back up again into the desired unit
		sidesteps these issues;
		''pow(30, 2)'' is indeed ''900'',
		and the author can interpret that however they wish.

		<hr>

		On the other hand, ''hypot()'' doesn't suffer from these problems.
		Numerical precision in units isn't a concern,
		as the inputs and output all have the same type.
		The result isn't unit-dependent, either,
		due to the nature of the operation;
		''hypot(3em, 4em)'' and ''hypot(48px, 64px)'' both result in the same length
		when ''1em'' equals ''16px'':
		''5em'' or ''80px''.
		Thus it's fine to let author use dimensions directly in ''hypot()''.
	</details>

	<div class=example>
		The ''pow()'' function can be useful for strategies like <a href="https://www.modularscale.com/">CSS Modular Scale</a>,
		which relates all the font-sizes on a page to each other by a fixed ratio.

		These sizes can be easily written into custom properties like:

		<pre class=lang-css>
		:root {
			--h6: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, -1));
			--h5: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 0));
			--h4: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 1));
			--h3: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 2));
			--h2: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 3));
			--h1: calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 4));
		}
		</pre>

		...rather than writing out the values in pre-calculated numbers like ''5.0625rem''
		(what ''calc(1rem * pow(1.5, 4))'' resolves to)
		which have less clear provenance when encountered in a stylesheet.
	</div>

	<div class=example>
		With a single argument,
		''hypot()'' gives the absolute value of its input;
		''hypot(2em)'' and ''hypot(-2em)'' both resolve to ''2em''.

		With more arguments,
		it gives the size of the main diagonal of a box
		whose side lengths are given by the arguments.
		This can be useful for transform-related things,
		giving the distance that an element will actually travel
		when it's translated by a particular X, Y, and Z amount.

		For example, ''hypot(30px, 40px)'' resolves to ''50px'',
		which is indeed the distance between an element's starting and ending positions
		when it's translated by a ''translate(30px, 40px)'' transform.
		If an author wanted elements to get smaller as they moved further away from their starting point
		(drawing some sort of word cloud, for example),
		they could then use this distance in their scaling factor calculations.

	In ''pow(A, B)'',
	if A is negative and finite,
	and B is finite,
	B must be an integer,
	or else the result is NaN.

	If A or B are infinite or 0,
	the following tables give the results:

	In ''sqrt(A)'',
	if A is +∞,
	the result is +∞.
	If A is 0⁻,
	the result is 0⁻.
	If A is less than 0,
	the result is NaN.

	In ''hypot(A, …)'',
	if any of the inputs are infinite,
	the result is +∞.

	<div class=note>
		All of these behaviors are intended to match the "standard" definitions of these functions
		as implemented by most programming languages,
		in particular as implemented in JS.

		The only divergences from the behavior of the equivalent JS functions
		are that NaN is "infectious" in <em>every</em> function,
		forcing the function to return NaN if any argument calculation is NaN.

		<details highlight=js>
			<summary>Details of the JS Behavior</summary>

			There are two cases in JS where a NaN is not "infectious"
			to the math function it finds itself in:

			* <code>Math.hypot(Infinity, NaN)</code> will return <code>Infinity</code>.
			* <code>Math.pow(NaN, 0)</code> will return <code>1</code>.

			The logic appears to be that,
			if you replace the NaN with <em>any</em> Number,
			the return value will be the same.
			However, this logic is not applied consistently to the <code>Math</code> functions:
			<code>Math.max(Infinity, NaN)</code> returns <code>NaN</code>, not <code>Infinity</code>;
			the same is true of <code>Math.min(-Infinity, NaN)</code>.

			Because this is an error corner case,
			JS isn't consistent on the matter,
			and NaN recognition/handling of [=calculations=]
			is likely done at a higher CSS level
			rather than in the internal math functions anyway,
			consistency in CSS was chosen to be more important,
			so all functions were defined to have "infection" NaN.

<h3 id='calc-syntax'>
Syntax</h3>

	The syntax of a [=math function=] is:

	<pre class='prod'>
	<<calc()>>  = calc( <<calc-sum>> )
	<<min()>>   = min( <<calc-sum>># )
	<<max()>>   = max( <<calc-sum>># )

	<<sin()>>   = sin( <<calc-sum>> )
	<<cos()>>   = cos( <<calc-sum>> )
	<<tan()>>   = tan( <<calc-sum>> )
	<<asin()>>  = asin( <<calc-sum>> )
	<<acos()>>  = acos( <<calc-sum>> )
	<<atan()>>  = atan( <<calc-sum>> )
	<<atan2()>> = atan2( <<calc-sum>>, <<calc-sum>> )
	<<pow()>>   = pow( <<calc-sum>>, <<calc-sum>> )
	<<sqrt()>>  = sqrt( <<calc-sum>> )
	<<hypot()>> = hypot( <<calc-sum>># )
	<dfn>&lt;calc-sum></dfn> = <<calc-product>> [ [ '+' | '-' ] <<calc-product>> ]*

	<dfn>&lt;calc-value></dfn> = <<number>> | <<dimension>> | <<percentage>> | ( <<calc-sum>> )
	</pre>

	In addition, [=whitespace=]
	is required on both sides of the <css>+</css> and <css>-</css> operators.
	(The <css>*</css> and <css>/</css> operaters can be used without white space around them.)

	Several of the math functions above have additional constraints
	on what their <<calc-sum>> arguments can contain.
	Check the definitions of the individual functions for details.

	UAs must support [=calculations=] of at least 20 <<calc-value>> terms.
	If a [=calculation=] contains more than the supported number of terms,
	it must be treated as if it were invalid.


<h3 id='calc-type-checking'>
Type Checking</h3>

	A [=math function=] can be many possible types,
	such as <<length>>, <<number>>, etc.,
	depending on the [=calculations=] it contains,
	as defined below.
	It can be used anywhere a value of that type is allowed.

	<div class=example>
		For example, the 'width' property accepts <<length>> values,
		so a [=math function=] that resolves to a <<length>>,
		such as ''calc(5px + 1em)'',
		can be used in 'width'.
	</div>

	Additionally, [=math functions=] that resolve to <<number>>
	can be used in any place that only accepts <<integer>>.
	(It gets rounded to the nearest integer,
	as specified in [[#calc-range]].)

	Operators form sub-expressions, which gain types based on their arguments.

	Note: In previous versions of this specification,
	multiplication and division were limited in what arguments they could take,
	to avoid producing more complex intermediate results
	(such as ''1px * 1em'', which is <<length>>²)
	and to make division-by-zero detectable at parse time.
	This version now relaxes those restrictions.

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn>determine the type of a [=calculation=]</dfn>:

		* At a <css>+</css> or <css>-</css> sub-expression,
			attempt to [=add two types|add the types=] of the left and right arguments.
			If this returns failure,
			the entire [=calculation’s=] type is failure.
			Otherwise, the sub-expression's [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is the returned type.

		* At a <css>*</css> sub-expression,
			[=multiply two types|multiply the types=] of the left and right arguments.
			The sub-expression's [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is the returned result.

		* At a <css>/</css> sub-expression,
			let |left type| be the result of finding the [=CSSNumericValue/types=] of its left argument,
			and |right type| be the result of finding the [=CSSNumericValue/types=] of its right argument
			and then [=invert a type|inverting=] it.

			The sub-expression's [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is the result of
			[=multiply two types|multiplying=] the |left type| and |right type|.

		* Anything else is a terminal value,
			whose [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is determined based on its CSS type:

			<dl class=switch>
				: <<number>>
				: <<integer>>
				:: the [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is «[ ]» (empty map)
				: <<length>>
				:: the [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is «[ "length" → 1 ]»
				: <<angle>>
				:: the [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is «[ "angle" → 1 ]»
				: <<time>>
				:: the [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is «[ "time" → 1 ]»
				: <<frequency>>
				:: the [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is «[ "frequency" → 1 ]»
				: <<resolution>>
				:: the [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is «[ "resolution" → 1 ]»
				: <<flex>>
				:: the [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is «[ "flex" → 1 ]»
				: <<percentage>>
				::
					If, in the context in which the [=math function=]
					containing this [=calculation=] is placed,
					<<percentage>>s are resolved relative to another type of value
					(such as in 'width', where <<percentage>> is resolved against a <<length>>),
					and that other type is <em>not</em> <<number>>,
					the [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is determined as the other type.

					Otherwise,
					the [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is «[ "percent" → 1 ]».
				: anything else
				:: The [=calculation’s=] type is failure.
			</dl>

			In all cases, the associated [=percent hint=] is null.
	</div>

	[=Math functions=] themselves have [=CSSNumericValue/types=],
	according to their contained [=calculations=]:

	* The [=CSSNumericValue/type=] of a ''calc()'' expression
		is the [=CSSNumericValue/type=] of its contained [=calculation=].
	* The [=CSSNumericValue/type=] of a ''min()'', ''max()'', or ''clamp()'' expression
		is the result of [=add two types|adding the types=]
		of its comma-separated [=calculations=].
	* The [=CSSNumericValue/type=] of a ''sin()'', ''cos()'', or ''tan()'' expression
		is «[ "number" → 1 ]».
	* The [=CSSNumericValue/type=] of an ''asin()'', ''acos()'', ''atan()'', or ''atan2()'' expression
		is «[ "angle" → 1 ]».
	* The [=CSSNumericValue/type=] of a ''pow()'' or ''sqrt()'' expression
		is «[ "number" → 1 ]».
	* The [=CSSNumericValue/type=] of a ''hypot()'' expression
		is the result of [=add two types|adding the types=]
		of its comma-separated [=calculations=].

	For each of the above,
	if the [=CSSNumericValue/type=] is failure,
	the [=math function=] is invalid.

	A [=math function=] resolves to <<number>>, <<length>>, <<angle>>, <<time>>, <<frequency>>, <<resolution>>, <<flex>>, or <<percentage>>
	according to which of those productions its [=CSSNumericValue/type=] [=CSSNumericValue/matches=].
	(These categories are mutually exclusive.)
	If it can't [=CSSNumericValue/match=] any of these,
	the [=math function=] is invalid.

	Division by zero is possible,
	which introduces certain complications.
	[=Math functions=] follow IEEE-754 semantics for these operations:

	* Dividing a positive value by zero produces +∞.
	* Dividing a negative value by zero produces −∞.
	* Adding or subtracting ±∞ to anything produces the appropriate infinity,
		unless a following rule would define it as producing NaN.
	* Multiplying any value by ±∞ produces the appropriate infinity,
		unless a following rule would define it as producing NaN.
	* Dividing any value by ±∞ produces zero,
		unless a following rule would define it as producing NaN.
	* Dividing zero by zero,
		dividing ±∞ by ±∞,
		multiplying 0 by ±∞,
		adding +∞ to −∞
		(or the equivalent subtractions)
		produces NaN.
	* Any operation with at least one NaN argument produces NaN.

	Additionally,
	IEEE-754 introduces the concept of "negative zero",
	which must be tracked within a calculation
	and between nested calculations:

	* Negative zero
		(0⁻)
		can be produced literally by negating a zero
		(''-0''),
		or by a multiplication or division that produces zero
		with exactly one negative argument
		(such as ''-5 * 0'' or ''1 / (-1 / 0)'').

		Note: Note that,
		outside of [=math functions=],
		''-0'' just produces a "standard" zero,
		identical to ''0''--
		CSS as a whole doesn't recognize the concept of signed zeros.
		Negative zeros also don't escape a [=math function=];
		as detailed below,
		they're "censored" away into an "unsigned" zero.
	* ''-0 + -0''
		or ''-0 - 0''
		produces 0⁻.
		All other additions or subtractions that would produce a zero
		produce 0⁺.
	* Multiplying or dividing 0⁻ with a positive number
		(including 0⁺)
		produces a negative result
		(either 0⁻ or −∞),
		while multiplying or dividing 0⁻ with a negative number
		produces a positive result.

		(In other words,
		multiplying or dividing with 0⁻
		follows standard sign rules.)
	* When comparing 0⁺ and 0⁻,
		0⁻ is less than 0⁺.
		For example, ''min(0, -0)'' must produce 0⁻,
		''max(0, -0)'' must produce 0⁺,
		and ''clamp(0, -0, 1)'' must produce 0⁺.

	If a <dfn export>top-level calculation</dfn>
	(a [=math function=] not nested inside of another [=math function=])
	would produce a NaN,
	it instead produces +∞.
	If a [=top-level calculation=] would produce 0⁻,
	it instead produces the standard "unsigned" zero.

	<div class=example>
		For example, ''calc(-5 * 0)'' produces an unsigned zero--
		the calculation resolves to 0⁻,
		but as it's a [=top-level calculation=],
		it's then censored to an unsigned zero.

		On the other hand, ''calc(1 / calc(-5 * 0))'' produces −∞,
		same as ''calc(1 / (-5 * 0))''--
		the inner calc resolves to 0⁻,
		and as it's not a [=top-level calculation=],
		it passes it up unchanged to the outer calc to produce −∞.
		If it was censored into an unsigned zero,
		it would instead produce +∞.
	</div>


	Note: Algebraic simplifications do not affect the validity of a [=math function=] or its resolved type.
	For example, ''calc(5px - 5px + 10s)'' and ''calc(0 * 5px + 10s)'' are both invalid
	due to the attempt to add a length and a time.

	Note: Note that <<percentage>>s relative to <<number>>s,
	such as in 'opacity',
	are not <em>combinable</em> with those numbers--
	''opacity: calc(.25 + 25%)'' is invalid.
	Allowing this causes significant problems with "unit algebra"
	(allowing multiplication/division of <<dimension>>s),
	and in every case so far,
	doesn't provide any new functionality.
	(For example, ''opacity: 25%'' is identical to ''opacity: .25'';
	it's just a trivial syntax transform.)
	You can still perform other operations with them,
	such as ''opacity: calc(100% / 3);'',
	which is valid.

	Note: Because <<number-token>>s are always interpreted as <<number>>s or <<integer>>s,
	"unitless 0" <<length>>s aren't supported in [=math functions=].
	That is, ''width: calc(0 + 5px);'' is invalid,
	because it's trying to add a <<number>> to a <<length>>,
	even though both ''width: 0;''
	and ''width: 5px;''
	are valid.

	Note: Altho there are a few properties in which a bare <<number>>
	becomes a <<length>> at used-value time
	(specifically, 'line-height' and 'tab-size'),
	<<number>>s never become "length-like" in ''calc()''.
	They always stay as <<number>>s.

<h3 id='calc-computed-value'>
Computed Value</h3>

	The computed value of a ''calc()'' function is the expression
	with all components computed.
	The computed value of a ''min()'', ''max()'', or ''clamp()'' function
	is the comma-separated list of expressions,
	with each expression having all its component computed.

	Where percentages are not resolved at computed-value time,
	they are not resolved in [=math functions=],
	e.g. ''calc(100% - 100% + 1px)'' resolves to ''calc(0% + 1px)'',
	not to ''1px''.
	If there are special rules for computing percentages in a value
	(e.g. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#the-height-property">the <css>height</css> property</a>),
	they apply whenever a [=math function=] contains percentages.

	<div class=note>
		Note: The serialization rules do not preserve the structure of the computation,
		so implementations can simplify the expressions
		further than what is required here
		when storing the values internally;
		in particular, all [=calculation=] expressions can be reduced
		to a sum of a <<number>>, a <<percentage>>, and some <<dimension>>s,
		eliminating all multiplication or division,
		and combining terms with identical units.

		At this time, all units can be absolutized
		to a single unit per type at computed-value time,
		so at that point the [=calculation=] can be reduced
		to just a <<number>>, a <<percentage>>, and a single absolute <<dimension>> of the appropriate type,
		per expression.
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		For example,
		whereas 'font-size' computes percentage values at <a>computed value</a> time
		so that <a>font-relative length</a> units can be computed,
		'background-position' has layout-dependent behavior for percentage values,
		and thus does not resolve percentages until used-value time.

		Due to this, 'background-position' computation preserves the percentage in a ''calc()''
		whereas 'font-size' will compute such expressions directly into a length.
	</div>

	<!-- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010May/0001.html
	This has notes on how we should handle things when calc() is extended to
	handle unit mult/div. Related to this is <unit>mod<unit>, which can return
	0 and thus introduce computed-time division-by-zero. -->

	Given the complexities of width and height calculations on table cells and table elements,
	math expressions mixing both percentages and lengths for widths and heights on
	table columns, table column groups, table rows, table row groups, and table cells
	in both auto and fixed layout tables
	MAY be treated as if ''width/auto'' had been specified.


<h3 id='calc-range'>
Range Checking</h3>

	Parse-time range-checking of values is not performed within [=math functions=],
	and therefore out-of-range values do not cause the declaration to become invalid.
	However, the value resulting from an expression
	must be clamped to the range allowed in the target context.
	Clamping is performed on <a>computed values</a> to the extent possible,
	and also on <a>used values</a>
	if computation was unable to sufficiently simplify the expression
	to allow range-checking.
	(Clamping is not performed on <a>specified values</a>.)

	Note: This requires all contexts accepting ''calc()''
	to define their allowable values as a closed (not open) interval.

	Note: By definition,
	±∞ are outside the allowed range for any property,
	and will clamp to the minimum/maximum value allowed.
	Even for properties that explicitly allow ''infinity'' as a keyword value,
	such as 'animation-iteration-count',
	will end up clamping ±∞,
	as [=math functions=] can't resolve to keyword values;
	the <em>numeric</em> part of the property's syntax still has a minimum/maximum value.

	Additionally, if a [=math function=] that resolves to <<number>>
	is used somewhere that only accepts <<integer>>,
	the [=computed value=] and [=used value=] are rounded to the nearest integer,
	in the same manner as clamping, above.
	The rounding method must be the same as is used for animations of integer values.

	<div class=example>
		Since widths smaller than 0px are not allowed,
		these three declarations are equivalent:

		<pre>
		width: calc(5px - 10px);
		width: calc(-5px);
		width: 0px;
		</pre>

		Note however that ''width: -5px'' is not equivalent to ''width: calc(-5px)''!
		Out-of-range values <em>outside</em> ''calc()'' are syntactically invalid,
		and cause the entire declaration to be dropped.

		Values outside the supported range must be clamped into the supported range.

		an 'opacity' value of ''0.9999'' would round to ''0.99'', not ''1.0'',
		and would therefore cause the element to create a stacking context.
		Similarly, a ''flex-grow'' value of ''0.001'' would round to ''0.01'',
		not ''0'', and would therefore be flexible.
	</div>


		When arithmetic is performed with numeric types
		(for example, in the ''calc()'' expression),
		if the result is unsupported
		it must also be clamped/rounded as necessary.
	<span class="note">
		Note this means that rounding errors <em>may</em> accumulate.

Registration for the <code>about:invalid</code> URL scheme</h3>

	This sections defines and registers the <code>about:invalid</code> URL,
	in accordance with the registration procedure defined in [[RFC6694]].


	The official record of this registration can be found at <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/about-uri-tokens/about-uri-tokens.xhtml">http://www.iana.org/assignments/about-uri-tokens/about-uri-tokens.xhtml</a>.

	<table class="data longlastcol">
		<tr>
			<th>Registered Token
			<td><code>invalid</code>
		<tr>
			<th>Intended Usage
			<td>
				The <code>about:invalid</code> URL references a non-existent document with a generic error condition.
				It can be used when a URL is necessary, but the default value shouldn't be resolveable as any type of document.

Changes</h2>

	Changes since the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-css-values-4-20181010/">10 October 2018 Working Draft</a> consist of
	synchronizing with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-css-values-3-20190131/#changes">recent changes in CSS Level 3</a>.

	Changes since the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-css-values-4-20180814/">14 August 2018 Working Draft</a>:

	<ul>
		<li>Added rules for interpolation per value type, and clarified computed values.
	</ul>

	Changes since <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/">Level 3</a>:

	<ul>
		<li>Added the ''vi'', ''vb'', ''ic'', ''cap'', ''lh'' and ''rlh'' units.
		<li>Added ''min()'', ''max()'', and ''clamp()'' functional notations.
		<li>Added unit arithmetic to ''calc()''.
		<li>Added ''toggle()'' (punted from level 3 originally).
		<li>Added [[#calc-type-checking|unit algebra]],
			cribbing from [[css-typed-om-1]].
		<li>A non-integer in a calc() automatically rounds to the nearest integer
			when used where an <<integer>> is required.
		<li>Defined [[#calc-serialize|serialization]] of [=math functions=].
	</ul>

Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

	This specification mostly just defines units that are common to CSS specifications,
	and which present no security concerns.

	Note: Does URL handling have a security concern?  Probably.

	This specification defines units that expose the user's screen size
	and default font size,
	but both are trivially observable from JS,
	so they do not constitutate a new privacy risk.
